argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48532 # FALSE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER #  # We'll hear argument this morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District. Mr. Andre.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48534 # FALSE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case asks the Court to decide to what extent non-lawyer parents of a child with a disability may litigate an IDEA case pro se in Federal court. Under two distinct theories, the answer to that question should be without limitation. But I would like to focus today on petitioner's primary and first theory, which is that parents are real parties in interest in IDEA suits regardless of the claims being asserted. Under 28 USC 1654, a party has a right as a matter of Federal statutory law to litigate their own case. Accordingly, when a parent sues under IDEA, it is our position they are suing in their own right and are suing on their own case. This is particularly so because the right to sue provision that Congress enacted in IDEA uses the broad phrase "any party aggrieved" when it allows judicial review of an adverse administrative hearing officer's decision. The parties agree that it is the underlying administrative complaint or the due process complaint that frames both the claims that can be brought eventually in court, and also identifies who the parties are that can appear in court. Those complaint provisions in IDEA, and there are eight of them in all we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief; all eight of those provisions refer unambiguously to the parents' complaints. Congress did not describe this due process complaint that starts the whole dispute process as the child's complaint, the child's complaint by and through the parents, or the parents' complaint on behalf of the child. Accordingly, when a parent files that due process complaint, they are the real party in interest, and again, the provisions make no distinctions about the kinds of claims that can be brought. It shouldn't matter that when they get to Federal court that -- or there shouldn't be any limitation on who is the real party in interest in Federal court, or what claims may be asserted.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48535 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If we say that the parents are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do we reach the second -- a second question as to whether or not they can represent the children?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48536 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't think you would need a reach a second question, Justice Kennedy. It's our position that the remedies in an IDEA case are co-extensive and that the rights are inseparable. And so, this case was pleaded in such a way as to have both the parents and the child be before the court. But if this court were to agree with us on our first and primary theory, we don't believe it would be necessary to have the child listed as a plaintiff to a future suit, and we imagine that on remand the child might be dismissed from the suit. It's our position that he's not an indispensable party.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48537 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What can the parents get out of this case other than reimbursement for the tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural rights that are given them by the Act? What can they get out of this case other than those two things that do not depend upon their status as representatives of the child?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48538 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, clearly the relief primarily sought by my clients -- in fact, if you look just at the relief section of the complaint that my clients filed, which is in joint appendix, page 19, the only relief they actually seek is reimbursement. There's a number of ways --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48539 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the Act? What other possible relief could they seek that they would not be seeking as guardians of the child?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48540 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Of course, it's our position that parents are never acting as guardians, at least in the legal sense, or lay representatives of a child in a court action. And so, therefore, a parent should be able to assert any one of the -- a claim asserting violation of any one of the many rights conferred in the Act.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48541 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It depends upon their being a party aggrieved. That is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48542 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Correct.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48543 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Now if the only remedies the parents are entitled to in their own right are reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to appear pro se be limited to those two categories? You'd win this case, but I'm talking about how broad is the rule that you're urging us to adopt?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48544 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, in -- and this could be a very easy case if the Court wants to look just at the specific procedural violations that my clients assert and also the reimbursement claim that they assert. But it's of course our position also that the full bundle of rights can be asserted by parents. I think maybe the best way to answer your question, Justice Scalia, is that -- to direct you back to the definition of a free appropriate public education itself, and that's in 1401(9) and (29) in the statute. That definition provides that a free appropriate public education is one that's provided at no cost to parents. So if a school district provides a free and inappropriate public education, then it's the parents' obligation -- or not obligation -- they have the choice of whether to supplement the inappropriate public education with additional services, or to replace the public education with one that provides an appropriate bundle of services. So I guess my point is that even in a case where the parents don't necessarily seeks reimbursement, they still are intended beneficiaries of the right to a free appropriate --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48545 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # The child is. The child is entitled to an appropriate public education and the parents are entitled to have it provided free. That's really the only interest they have on the table, it seems to me, separate and apart from their status as representatives or guardians of the child.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48546 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We also believe that the parents have an interest in the education being appropriate for -- in addition to the reason I just explained, that they may have to supplement education, but parents are also the co-architects of the individualized educational program that is eventually -- that eventually defines the bundle of services that it provides the child. And they're integral to the --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48547 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, you say they're the co-architects. I mean, are you saying anything more than they are given the procedural right to participate in the hearing?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48548 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think they're given -- I haven't counted them -- but I think they're given 10, 12 of the 15 procedural rights outlined in the statute. And this Court explained in Rowley, Congress placed every bit as much emphasis on parental involvement in the shaping of the individualized educational program --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48549 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Isn't there a bit of -- there's a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a different question, isn't it?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48550 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, typically a parent would file a due process complaint, challenging the bundle of services offered by the school district, and alleging a procedural violation. And so I think it would be a rare case where a parent would, by the time they get to Federal court, try to be a party aggrieved is something that they didn't exhaust -- that would render the exhaustion requirement.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48551 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # They are an aggrieved party for purposes of the administrative process. The question is whether that -- when that is done, whether they also constitute an aggrieved party. And one of the -- one of the points made by the other side is that there is an express provision for proceeding without counsel at the administrative level, and there's no provision for proceeding without counsel in court. So doesn't that suggest that the right to proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48552 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, not at all, Justice Ginsburg. Congress sensibly recognized that because the process proceedings are run on a State by State basis, certain unauthorized practice of law statutes or other laws require prohibiting counsel in administrative proceedings might come into play. So Congress had to make it express in section 1415(h)(1) that any party may appear in the administrative proceedings with or without counsel. In contrast, in Federal court, there's already 28 U.S.C. 1654, which has been on the books since 1789 as part of the Judiciary Act. That provision allows any party to litigate their own case. So it actually makes a lot of sense that Congress would have included the express right to proceed pro se --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48553 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Which just begs the question, doesn't it? I mean, you're assuming that the parents are a party to the case in Federal court.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48554 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, again, it is our position that they are because they're parties aggrieved by the administrative proceedings, so long as they have exhausted their claims. And that this is confirmed in other provisions, for example, the attorneys' fees provision of the statute refers repeatedly to parents as a possible prevailing party.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48555 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I thought it was the unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a general matter, do not have the right to represent their children in Federal court, that the provision of the judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents, generally, the right to represent children.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48556 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But our primary theory in this case is not that parents are seeking to represent their children as lay advocates in court. Our primary theory is that a parent suing under the statute is suing in their own right. In fact, that's why my clients pleaded this case with -- as -- with themselves on the caption, and asserted claims that are their own, because they believed that those claims are their own, and they believed they should be able to litigate those claims under section 1654.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48557 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # You know, it's not an insignificant matter at issue here. Counsel, who are referred to as officers of the court, protect the court from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no basis. When we give that authority to appear in court and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a lot more work for Federal district judges. Why should we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual result?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48558 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I'm not sure that the policy considerations would be relevant to the statutory construction question of whose rights are being asserted in a case like this. But certainly under our second theory, the public policy considerations would be appropriate. It is our position that those public policy concerns about pro se litigants burdening the court, burdening opposing counsel are dramatically outweighed by the fact that -- by the reality that two-thirds of the disabled children in the United States come from families that cannot afford counsel --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48559 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # The statute already allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party. So presumably attorneys can be found to take the meritorious cases. And What we are probably dealing with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their fees.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48560 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Two responses Mr. Chief Justice. First, in other regimes, where you have a fee-shifting statute, the cases are usually still brought by pro se litigants. Here because you are dealing with a minor child, really, it is an all or nothing proposition. Either bring the case and you have the potential to recover attorneys' fees, or the case doesn't get brought at all. And this is borne out by the statistics cited in our position and the amicus briefs from the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, and the Autism Society of America.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48561 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Was their an argument at any point in this case that the claim was frivolous?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48562 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, there was not. And then that brings me to my last point, which is, as a practical matter, there is a very limited private special ed bar and they cherry-pick only the best cases. But that doesn't mean that all the cases that are left are frivolous or meritless. There's a whole universe of cases out there, some of which may be quite strong, some of which may be on the borderline, and some which may be meritless. But Congress cannot have intended to create this important and robust substantive statutory guarantee to a free and appropriate public education, and guarantee all these procedural safeguards, including judicial review to enforce it, and then expect that that right would never be fulfilled because --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48563 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, if they had that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough for them to make clear that this was an exception to the normal rule, that parents don't have the right to represent children in court. They did that with respect to the administrative proceeding, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out. They perhaps conspicuously did not do it with respect to the proceeding in court.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48564 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, actually, if I could clarify one thing. If you look closely at section 1415(h)(1), it does not provide that a parent can represent their child in the administrative proceeding. It just says that any party may litigate that administrative proceeding.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48565 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I know, but 14 -- is it 1415(f)? Specifically says that parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing. I'm looking at 1415(f)(1)(A). In other words, parents have the right to participate in the due process hearing.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48566 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But that's also -- our position is they have the right to participate in the due process hearing as parties, in fact as the kind of plaintiff side parties. And that is confirmed by the provisions that we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief that talk about the parents' complaint.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48567 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It doesn't say they have the right to participate as parties. They have -- it says they have the right to -- for an impartial due process hearing. I would suppose if you're trying to figure out who is the party to that case, you would still think of it in terms of the child and not the parents.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48568 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we thought that -- we believe that Congress thought of it as the parents because of all the statutory references to the parents' complaint. Of course, we don't take the absurd position that the child could not also be a party to those proceedings. But in any event, my point was simply that the express Lesesne argument that some courts relied on to suggest that Congress consciously decided not to allow parental lay representation, I mean, that argument simply doesn't have a strong foundation, because the provision on which that argument is based, which is 1415(h)(1), is ambiguous at best. And, in fact, could suggest just the opposite. I'd like to address a point that Respondents have relied on --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48569 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Before you do that, how much of a practical benefit would it be for children with disabilities and their parents, if you are successful here, in light of the complexity of the IDEA and the fact that this is an area where some parents are going to have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional detachment from the litigation? If parents can represent their -- can -- a non-lawyer parent can appear in court, isn't there a risk that in some instances where a lawyer could be found if the parent made an effort to do that, they're going to be lured into trying to provide the representation themselves?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48570 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, first of all, parents already have to get to know the statute and the applicable regulations when they bring these cases at the administrative level. By the time they get to court, they are intimately familiar with the facts and intimately familiar with the relevant law. The only thing that's different about the court action and the administrative proceeding is now you have the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48571 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # These disadvantaged parents that you are referring to who comprise the majority of parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1) and all that stuff? I find that hard to believe. I mean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are the people least likely to have familiarized themselves with the statute and the procedures.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48572 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm not sure we agree, with all due respect, Justice Scalia. But even if that's true, the nature of IDEA court action, I think, addresses some of the concern. These are not pure record review proceedings, like in merit systems protection board cases, or immigration cases. But they are quasi review proceedings. And so what we're advocating here is really access to the courts. Let the parents, whether they are brilliant writers or they're not so good at writing, let them at least have access to the courts, so that will then -- a capable district judge can look at the case and decide whether the school should have complied with the statutory mandates.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48573 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And do it right after reading pro se prisoner petitions, right? You'd have a nice evening's work.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48574 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We think that the pro se parents are quite different from pro se prisoners. I'd like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48575 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Andre. Mr. Salmons.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48577 # FALSE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress made parents of children with disabilities parties in their own right in administrative and judicial proceedings under the IDEA, and granted parents their own rights under the Act. One of the rights granted expressly to parents is the right to seek reimbursement for private educational expenses when the parents believe the school has failed to provide an appropriate education. That is the claim that's at issue in this case, and the parents are clearly the appropriate party for that claim because they're the ones that have incurred the financial harm. When they are reimbursed --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48578 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That argument proves a little too much. If you have a child who is the victim of a tort, for example, and suffers a serious injury, it is the parents who are going to have to bear the costs of accommodating that injury. And yet in any tort action, it's still the child who is the party and not the parent.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48579 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think that's right, Your Honor, but the difference here is that the statute in section 1412(a)(10)(C)(2), and this is on page 6A of Petitioner's brief, expressly provides a right to parents to seek reimbursement for the -- for their -- the educational expenses that they incur. And while the parents have to show that there was a denial of a free appropriate public education, we think it's clear that the statute makes the claim the parent's claim. And there are cases, for example, out of the Fourth District, in Emery, that would suggest that it is not even clear that the child would have standing to assert a claim for reimbursement when they're not out of pocket any expenses. So we think in a case like this, this is an easy case. We think clearly here the parents are the parties.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48580 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But then you would be establishing a right for the least needy. I mean, if they're seeking reimbursement, they're able to pay the private school tuition. It's the people who can't -- who have no alternative, they have to take what the school district gives them because they don't have the wherewithal to enroll their child in a private school. And your argument, concentrating on the reimbursement right, would leave out those people, would it not?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48581 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that's not the sum total of our argument, Your Honor. I was just pointing out that actually there's a relatively narrow way to decide this case if the Court so chose, by focusing on the reimbursement claim in this case. Our position is that parents share in the substantive right to a free appropriate public education under the Act. And there are two things we would point to in regard to the definition of a free appropriate public education that we think makes this clear. And this is in section 1401 of the Act on pages 2A and 4A of Petitioner's brief. The first is the definition says that the term free appropriate public education means special education services provided, quote, without charge and at no cost to parents. We think clearly the free aspect, again, is first and foremost a right of the parents, because they're the ones that bear the cost. With regard to --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48582 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I'm not following you. Where is this provision? 1401 what?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48583 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I think you quoted from 4(a).
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48584 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There's -- That's correct. The definition begins on page 2(a) "which says free appropriate public education on section 1401 and it says, "the term free appropriate public education means special education related services that -- and under subparagraph A have been provided at public expense under public supervision and direction and without charge -- Then in subparagraph 29 on page 4(a)the term special education is defined which is again the term from the definition of free appropriate public education, is defined to mean "specially designed instructions at no cost to parents." And so again the right to a free appropriate public education is defined expressly in part as terms of the parents interest. We also think that regards to any question about what is the appropriate, if you look back again on 2(a), subparagraph D of the definition of free appropriate public education, it says that it has to be special education services that are provided in conformity with the individual education program required under the Act. And now the individual education program or IEP process is the process by which parents are given the right to participate as full members of the IEP team and to have a say in helping to define what is an appropriate education for the child. And as this Court pointed out in Rowley, this is the essential feature of this Act. The way it works is that Congress did not specify or flesh out a substantive standard for what is appropriate for a child' instead it ensured -- it mandated, excuse me -- that an appropriate education is an education that involves parental involvement. And when there is a dispute with regard to whether the IEP team has adopted the right educational program for the child, we think that the Act makes parents, who again, who are full members of that team, when their views are rejected as far as what is appropriate, they are given the procedural safeguard of initiating a due process hearing. Again the Act refers repeatedly to --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48585 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So their, their rights -- so their right to proceed in Federal court should be limited to the rights that you've identified under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on behalf of the child?

I thought you were saying that they can sue for the money and they can sue for denied procedures.

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48594 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well -- well -- just because I haven't limited the rights of the parents right doesn't mean that I haven't been trying to make a point about how to interpret the statute. The statute we think does not limit the parents' rights to sue on behalf of their child and on behalf of their own rights under the statute. We think the way to think about this -- again, keep in mind that the right to initiate a due process hearing and the right to seek review of that in court, those are rights that are contained in Section 1415, which is the procedural protection, the procedural guarantees of the Act. And we think those are rights that belong to the parents.

It's the same term, parties aggrieved, that refers to the right to an appeal in the administrative process that refers to the ability to initiate a civil cause of action.

It is referred to repeatedly as the parents' complaint and the parents are -- are referred to as prevailing parties in the civil action. Again in the attorneys fee provisions that were added in 2004, expressly refer to quote, "the parents' complaint or subsequent cause of action." This is on page 24 A of Petitioner's brief. And it refers to parents as a prevailing party. There are other provisions that do so as well and while we're on the topic of the 2004 amendments -- I see my time is up.

The common law rule banning parental pro se representation is as longstanding as it is pervasive. Appreciating the fact that the IDEA does not abrogate the common law rule, Petitioners instead seek to circumvent that through this substantive rights theory. If a due process complaint never raised any issue of parental substantive rights, nor even did their cert petition, which at page 11 said children had substantive rights but parents have procedural rights. Now, however, they tell this Court that the right -- the parents' substantive right is so ingrained in the fabric of the statute that the courts should recognize it.

And it sets up some procedures in the agency which is for the children and the parents and school board, and everybody is supposed to be there. And then another part of the same section says any person aggrieved by the first has a court hearing. Why isn't that the end of it? It's clearly aimed, as the statute is aimed, at both students and parents. And then we give them all procedural rights, and what in the statute says that the procedures that they're following before the school board happen to be for both parents and students. But without saying a word, a different procedure, a Federal court procedure in the same section, without saying anything, would be just for the students and not for the parents?

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48654 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, let me try to explain, Justice Breyer. The reason is as Petitioners effectively conceded in their reply brief, party aggrieved does depend on the party entitled to the remedy. And if we look at the amendment in 1415(f)(3)(E), which was just added in 2004, it clarifies that all relief that the hearing officer should award is based on substantive violation to the child. And it's important that if we look to the entirety of subchapter 2, there are more than two dozen references to the right, to the obligation, to the provision of a FAPE to the child. That is what we are talking about. The dispute resolution provisions hinge on vindicating the child's right. And I think the question earlier to Mr. Salmons was --

In any event, it limits the hearing officer's ability to reward relief based on the substantive, whether the substantive right to the FAPE has been awarded or not. And then we return to Justice Breyer's point about the party aggrieved, the party aggrieved by the finding or decision. Because the decision is limited to substantive grounds, that is what we are really talking about here. And I think one of the confusing aspects about what the nature of the substantive right is, and I think we've heard some different versions of that this morning, is what is the scope. Petitioners in their reply brief seem to try to retreat a little bit and make the rights more palatable. But if they -- in doing so, the question is, what is the right different than the child's right? And we simply do not have the answer to that, and for the school districts applying this act on a daily basis, and for courts interpreting it, it simply poses numerous problems trying to apply to a parent a statute that was designed to benefit children.

Isn't that so? It says the -- I think so -- it says a parent is to be reimbursed. I thought that was one of the things that --

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48681 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Bergeron, I have a basic conceptual problem, both with that response and with your larger argument. Leaving aside how we should classify the reimbursement right or classify reimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the substantive right of the child to the free appropriate public education and on the other hand, the procedural rights of the parent in going through the process that ultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's benefit. The conceptual problem I have is that I don't understand why it makes sense to say that the parents have procedural rights unless that procedural -- or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents. We give procedural protection to people in order to vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim, and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart. You're saying one person has a substantive right, the other people have procedural right. And I don't see conceptually how you can make that split. And if you don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the right to the free public -- the free appropriate public education is, as the statute in one place seems to say, a right of the family group, the parents and the child together, rather than the right of the child alone. So conceptually, how do you defend the distinction that you make between substantive rights on one person and procedural rights in another?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48682 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And here's how I would explain it, Justice Souter. The right, the substantive right is the right to a FAPE to the child. And because the child does not have capacity, Congress implemented a pragmatic system to allow the parents to protect those rights. It's derivative for the parent to protect the child's right --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48683 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Then why don't we say that they are the procedural rights of the child and the parents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to vindicate them?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48684 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is exactly what 1415(m) says, Your Honor. That allows a transfer of rights. And 1415(m) is at 11a and 12a of the red brief, and I hope I've got the cite right this time. 1415(m) allows for states to require, and Ohio does, to require the transfer of all rights under subchapter 2 that a parent would otherwise have, straight to the child. So basically --

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48690 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Oh. Well, what I'm trying to say is because the child lacks capacity, they can't do all these things on their own until they reach majority. But once they do and the rights transfer, it illustrates that it's not really the parents' rights, it is the child's right that they are protecting.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48691 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # What if -- what stands in the way of that analysis is the text, which says all other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter transfer to the child.

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48694 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, let me clarify then. I wasn't denying the existence of the procedural safeguard. To the contrary, what I'm saying is that they are not redressible independent of themselves in Federal court unless -- and this is what 1415(f)(3)(E) clarifies, is that you have to have a substantive violation. Because if you think of a situation in which the child is provided a FAPE, no one disputes that, but a parent says well, you didn't invite me to a meeting, what's your remedy there? There is no remedy. And that's what Congress was trying to clarify.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48695 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Isn't that the problem? On the analysis that you're coming up with, parents end up without even the procedural rights, because you're saying the only person who can basically invoke a violation of procedural right is the person whose been denied the substantive right. The parent hasn't been denied the substantive right. Therefore, the parent cannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly on your own analysis, the parent has been given. That can't be correct.

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48700 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, the -- that's what Congress was trying to clarify in 2004. They did not want technical procedural violations to eclipse the substantive rights, and so what they provided was the substantive right is the only one that is important.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48701 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yeah, but instead of saying they're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally blocked out. Because you analysis, I thought was, in response to my earlier objection, that the procedural right, in fact, can only ultimately be invoked for the vindication of the substantive right. And because the substantive right is the child's, not the parents, it would follow that the parents cannot even invoke their procedural rights, and we know that that can't be correct.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48702 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right, and I'm not saying that the parent -- the parent's procedural rights are gone. I mean, remember --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48703 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But if the parent's procedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be able to invoke those procedural rights based on what they claim to be a denial of some substantive entitlement. You're saying that's the entitlement of the child, but if the parents are going to have any procedural right worth having, they've got to invoke it for the purpose of vindicating that substantive right; isn't that correct?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48704 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48705 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. Then why do not the parents, when they are claiming that they are aggrieved, have as much right to make a claim that goes to the substantive denial as to the procedural denial, simply because the two are inseparable?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48706 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, because that -- again, that was what Congress was trying to clarify in 2004. And if you look at the DiBuo case and the Lesesne case cited on page 27 of the SG's brief, both those cases make clear that notwithstanding procedural violations, there must actually be a causation, there must actually be substantive harm before any relief can flow from that.

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48709 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I think I understand your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' fees and it's phrased in a very curious way. It says that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability. It seems to me that's the most difficult express language for you to deal with. It doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a parent. And I understand your argument to be that a parent can never be a prevailing party.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48710 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's right. And let me try to explain why. If you look at 1411(e)(3)(E), which is 5a of the red brief, and I'm sorry to keep jumping briefs on you, that provides that litigation brought to secure the right of the child to a FAPE is brought on behalf of the child. So Congress added both that section and the section you were just referring to at the same time, and the only way to read them harmoniously is that any action that is being brought on behalf of the child to secure the FAPE, it's not the parent's own action that they are bringing, they are bringing it on their own -- on behalf of the child.

The disbursements under subparagraph (d) shall not support legal fees, court costs, or other costs associated with the cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a disability to ensure a free and appropriate public education for such child. What do you think that proves?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48716 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # What I'm saying is Congress recognized that when legal action is being brought to secure FAPE, just like it's the child's right to the FAPE under subchapter 2, it is being brought on behalf of the child. And that's where petitioners run into problem with the common rule law, because the common law rule that they don't dispute is that parents cannot bring claims on behalf of the child pro se. So they have to find a way to abrogate, and they initially argued in the opening brief for an exception to the common law rule, which from my reading of the reply brief they have abandoned. So the core issue in dispute as far as the petitioners go is what is the nature of the substantive right. And I'd like to make the --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48717 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # There's a section you pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph (d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d).
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48718 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's the high cost, one of the high cost funds for states, Justice Ginsburg. I'd like to make --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48719 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well then, if this provision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you argue that it covers the waterfront?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48720 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I think it's indicative of what Congress appreciated the claim would look like on any level, and it's not simply saying that those funds aren't provided under subparagraph (d). That is the nature of the claim. Regardless of under what section we are looking at, that is the nature of the claim that could be brought in order to secure a FAPE for the child, and in every circumstance, it is brought on behalf of the child. Your Honor, I'd like to make one point, if I can, about the spending clause, in response to petitioner's argument in the reply brief. Petitioners effectively say that the spending clause doesn't apply because this is not an issue of liability. I'd like to direct your attention again to Rowley, where at footnotes 11 and 26 the Court recognized the difference between the educational benefit which is the FAPE, and maximizing the educational outcome.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48721 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Are attorneys' fees allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases on behalf of a child pro se?

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48723 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It's a convoluted question. Okay. So there's no issue under the spending clause that a non-attorney parent would be able to claim some sort of attorneys' fees?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48724 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's what -- I think there have been four circuits who addressed that in the context of attorney parents, and they've all said that they cannot get fees.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48725 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48726 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Arlington did not limit it to simply liability. It said repeatedly obligations and conditions. And that's exactly what Rowley was looking at in footnotes 11 and 26. We don't necessarily have -- have to have a line item that there's going to be X dollars in damage. It was simply the difference between an educational benefit and maximizing that benefit that triggered spending cost concerns in Rowley. Just like in South Dakota v Dole the issue of whether someone was 21 in order to consume alcohol was not necessarily a liability but it was a very important obligation or condition imposed upon the State. And their second point regarding the spending clause is that not every single detail needs to be fleshed out in clear notice.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48727 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So I take it your argument is, your red brief argument is that Congress said, states, if you get some judgments against you and they award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't?

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48737 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I thought what your argument was -- and if it's not, forget it, it's just that I don't understand it. That here the Government says pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its defines what you're supposed to pay out of our own pocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own action. And then later on they say, they define it differently. They talk about prevailing party. The parents of the prevailing party. But you say that second phrase must mean the first phrase. Because it wouldn't make sense for the Government to say pay for that out of the grant but not this out of the grant. That's your argument?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48738 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And -- I think that's right.

argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48740 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And -- and just to clarify, Congress hasn't provided any funds for this. I mean they, they recognized in 2004 they were only funding 19 percent of the obligations of the statute, and we have to pick up the balance of the tab. And their other argument on the spending clause is that it's, you don't have to flesh out everything in the statute but here we're talking about two core issues. One is abrogating the common rule law and the other is creation of substantive rights to an entirely new class of beneficiaries. If there's ever anything that demanded clear notice, this is it. It is much more serious and severe than the expert fees at issue in Arlington, and school districts and states simply have to have notice, what is the parameter of the right that you are being requested to recognize? And based on the briefing, and based on what we have heard in argument, it is simply not clear to the school districts not only what the nature of the right is but how to apply it.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48741 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, that's where I have a little bit of trouble. It's not -- the underlying right is still the same. It's the right of the child to a free and appropriate public education. And that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys who get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're talking about is a situation where the parents can assert that same right when an attorney won't. And I'm just wondering how significant additional exposure we're talking about? And what turns on that is whether to take the spending clause argument seriously or not.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48742 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well -- and I think the answer to that is it's still not clear to me from -- from listening to the argument today, I mean, Petitioner acknowledged the child falls out of the equation. This is a statute that needs to benefit the child, and they're taking the child completely out. And so what is the nature of this parental right? The SG says well, it's all, it's all intertwined. But if we look at what Petitioner said --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48743 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So if you agree we're talking about. What is the toll on the states, it seems to me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer, if it lost, and that parents who brings the case is not entitled to reimbursement, how is the state's pocketbook affected?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48744 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, in litigating this case while the Winkelmans were pro se, we expended far greater than the #8,000 at issue in Arlington, on our legal fees defending --
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48745 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Right. But you would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to take the case. What, what your spending clause argument is, the State agreed to undertake this liability, that they would have to provide a free and appropriate education, that if they litigated, they would have pay the other side's attorneys' fees. But if they knew that in the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the parents could prosecute it, and that might result in overturning their decision and that might result in greater expense, well, in that case they would not have bought into this deal at all. That seems a little implausible.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48746 # TRUE # MR. BERGERON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Mr. Chief Justice, remember at the time the Congress reauthorized in 2004, every circuit that had addressed it besides the First had agreed that parents could not bring a pro se. So the states reasonably would not have believed, especially in the circuits where it was decided, that they would have to -- have to come up with these funds.

I would like to turn briefly to Respondents' assertion that Petitioners somehow waived their claim to reimbursement by not exhausting it below. We addressed this in our reply brief, but if the Court wishes to look at pages 78 and 88 of the joint appendix, particularly page 78, there it is clear that the Petitioners were seeking reimbursement in their own right. On the page 153, that Respondent refers to, I assume that that point in time we were now on appeal to the second tier of the Ohio administrative proceeding, and perhaps at that point in time, Monarch School was actually paying for Jake's education on a grant-like basis, because that was something that happened in this case. And that perhaps at that point in time Petitioners referenced reimbursement to Monarch because Monarch had actually been expending the fund. But by and large my clients expended the funds to educate Jake at Monarch School, and they certainly did exhaust that claim to reimbursement.

And I mean, I think that's why Congress included the attorneys' fee provision in 2004 that recognized that parents can be prevailing parties. And if they prevail on establishing that a free appropriate public education has not been provided, then they can recover attorneys' fees as part of their, their right to try to vindicate Congress's purposes at no cost to them.
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48765 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So why didn't Congress just add the provision making this very clear that the Senate had passed, why did the House boot it out of the conference bill?
argument in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District # 05-983 # 48766 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We don't know. The legislative record is entirely silent. But one plausible inference could be, could be reached based on looking at the addition of attorney's fees provision and the timing of the Maroni decision in the First Circuit. Maroni came down after the parental lay representation provision was proposed by the Senate. Maroni was the first court of appeals case to recognize that parents may litigate these cases pro se. The way Maroni did it however was by adopting our primary argument here today, which is that parents possess the right to -- to sue in their own name, as pro se litigants, not as lay representatives of their children, and seek to enforce the full bundle of rights. Congress very well could have looked at Maroni and said aha, that's what we intended all along; Maroni got it right, and then they just put -- Congress just put the thumb on the scale a little bit by enacting the attorneys fee provision which made it clear that parents can be, or are the prevailing party if the plaintiffs prevail in an IDEA action. Finally, I would like to address two -- two points about the spending clause. Of course we believe the spending clause is totally inapplicable, but I want to respond to Respondent's suggest that we're advocating creation of a new substantive right here.

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48307 # FALSE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's troubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act. Under the text and structure of the act, as well as the categorical approach that this Court recognized in Shepard and Taylor, Florida attempted burglary convictions should not qualify as they -- these types of convictions do not involve explicitly, implicitly or even inherently, a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. The Respondent in their brief has enunciated a test to determine whether a conviction should qualify, and that test that they enunciate is basically a district court judge or a sentencing judge uses their common sense and experience to determine whether an offense should qualify. That type of test is not the kind of test that this Court enunciated in Taylor and Official Shepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at determining whether convictions should qualify. The categorical approach that this Court enunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of prior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements of those crimes. As such, the Government's argument would open up a -- is a broad mandate that courts could use to bring in almost any type of crime, any kind of felony to be included within the Armed Career Criminal Act. For instance, simple possession of cocaine is a third-degree felony in Florida. It's a five-year statutory maximum. Under the serious drug offense that Congress enumerated, it would only qualify if it had a 10-year statutory maximum and it involved the distribution of drugs. Yet, if the Government's approach to the interpretation of the otherwise clause is to be used, that simple possession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using their common sense and everyday experience determines it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Obviously --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48308 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # If we were looking at attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk of physical injury to another? Official
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48309 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, in Taylor, this Court was clear that under enumerated burglary or generic burglary, the offense becomes a -- has that serious potential risk when the person actually enters the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an attempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most other States, that act has not occurred. You haven't entered, the defendant has not entered the property.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48310 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # If the would-be burglar is climbing through the window or on a ladder with the intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48311 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If the conduct -- again, we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry. Obviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far. Other attempted burglaries are caught well before that actually occurs. But if you were to say that the attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to get into the place and the person actually didn't get in, again, under Taylor, it says the risk is when the person enters. The risk is much less outside the dwelling than inside the dwelling.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48312 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But in Florida, that would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the curtilage around the house? Official
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48313 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The curtilage is a unique concept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is the enclosed space around the house that has some kind of enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes. So if the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to the residence, that would actually be a burglary within the State of Florida. In other States, it may not.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48314 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Right. And we don't even have to ask whether that presents a serious potential risk under the statute, right? Because, if burglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without the need to resort to the definition?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48315 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it would be a burglary in the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated in Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very specific. It is the entering a dwelling or structure. And in Florida, you could be guilty of a burglary without entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a curtilage burglary.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48316 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, you could do it in a noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of the ladder. I mean, you would have -- you would have taken a substantial step. You would have made an attempt. Now why would that not qualify under the words of the Official statute that referred to a potential risk? Haven't you created the potential for the risk of harm that the statute is getting at when you take the substantial step?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48317 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, trying to use the Court's words in Taylor, Taylor talked about that --

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48319 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Okay.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48320 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I mean, haven't you in the words of the statute, created the potential for the risk when you take that substantial step by starting up the ladder?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48321 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If you started up the ladder and that's the way the attempted burglary conviction came down, it would be a lot closer call to say that would be a potential risk. Whether it's a serious potential risk under Taylor, it is not as clear.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48322 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But you wouldn't analyze it on the basis of whether this defendant started up the ladder. As I understand, you would -- you have to analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk; isn't that the way it has to be done?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48323 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's the way that we submit Official it has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those facts.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48324 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No, but I thought your argument was that that analysis would not lead to the result unfavorable to your client because the nature of starting up the ladder did not create or could not reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk. In other words, I thought you were saying -- maybe I misunderstood your argument -- that the reason the Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a substantial step -- which is what the indictment would charge -- could not be seen as creating the potential risk that the statute talks about. Now if I'm not understanding your argument correctly, you know, straighten me out here.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48325 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think I understand. That substantial step in even taking a step up the ladder, Mr. James would submit based on the language of the statute, would not qualify and would not create that serious potential risk of physical injury.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48326 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And that's why simply charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the statute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48327 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48328 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But even if it would, Official that's only one manner of attempt. And it seems to me, if you're going to do it generically, you have to look over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say, a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or extortion? Indeed, I guess you have to use the least dangerous. Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct. Now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes already mentioned, and I would say that means that the unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes mentioned, which I would take to be extortion. Wouldn't you say?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48329 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Of those four, extortion does seem to potentially have the least risk of all those crimes enumerated. But --

But it may very well be that the word potential is in there in order to accommodate attempts.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48337 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If that were true, I mean, Congress when they wrote the statute, and in 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), or (e)(2)(B)(ii)(1), they specifically enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that violence. So it has an element, use of or attempted use of, or threatened use of physical force. But under prong two, they specifically deleted that word "attempt".

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48340 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That's quite Official different than specifically deleting it. In other words, it was never there in the proposal.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48341 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In 1984 actually, there was a proposal where burglary would qualify and attempted burglary would qualify. That was passed by the Senate, never passed by the House, never enacted. So later on when burglary was actually defined, burglary was defined as the type of burglary that Taylor came close to defining the same way.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48342 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So, do I understand your submission to be that putting a ladder against the side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential risk of physical injury?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48343 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If that were the only way to prove an attempted burglary within a State, if that would be -- that would be the requirement, the legal requirement that you have to put the ladder against the house and that's an element of the offense, that to me would be a much closer call; but still, under the analysis that we have provided the Court with the Russello presumption, it should not qualify. But it is a closer case. Whereas categorically when you look at attempted burglaries, the putting the ladder against the Official side of the house is an element of the offense.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48344 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # We understand from your friend on the other side that an overt act toward fulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law.

It sounds to me if you're wondering about whether there's a specific serious risk of harm, you could find out. Look at the conviction that in Florida for attempted burglary, look at the convictions for burglary, and see if the harm involved, the number of cases in which people are harmed is roughly similar. We have all these law professors who like statistics. Now they like law in economics and everything. So why don't they go out there and count, and then we'd actually know, instead of sitting here and trying to figure out something I know nothing about. I've never been involved in a lot of burglaries. I don't know how the burglaries operate. I suspect some people are hurt, but rather than my Official suspicion why don't we find out what the facts are?

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48352 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But what do we know about the dimensions of the Florida attempt crime? For example, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess burglary tools. Does it mean or does it exclude casing the house, walking up and down the street, around the block? When is a step substantial enough to constitute an attempt under Florida law?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48353 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it's not really a step analysis, a substantial step analysis. It is an overt act. It's some overt act manifesting your intent to actually --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48354 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # What is that concretely? It's not possessing burglar's tools, it's not casing the place. What qualifies as an overt act that would make one guilty of the crime of attempted burglary?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48355 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If you had a diagram of the Official person's house and you had burglary tools in your car and you had maybe even called to make sure the business was closed and you were driving there and as you're driving there you're telling the person sitting beside you: I'm going to break into that, you know, business at 254 Main Street. That would be enough under Florida law to convict someone for attempted burglary of a structure.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48356 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I guess we have to decide how many attempts involve that kind of initial action, which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how many of them involve putting a ladder up against the side of the house. How do we possibly figure that out, to decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of risk from extortion?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48357 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That may be -- that may be a very difficult question to answer, and maybe the Respondent had that obligation in the district court, because they have the obligation to prove that this enhancement has that substantial or that serious potential risk of physical injury to another and of course they didn't do that. But if you look back in this Court's decision in 1985 in Tennessee versus Official Garner, this Court was talking about completed burglaries and it talked about physical violence to a person would only occur in a rare case, and it gave the percentage I think of 3.6 or 3.8 percent of the time. But that's in a completed burglary. That's not even talking about an attempted burglary, what's the risk --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48358 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # May I ask you this question: It seems to me there are two ways to read the burglary, arson or extortion examples: That they are clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put in the statute to say, even though they don't involve serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered, because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the statute nevertheless defines it. So do you read those terms as giving examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of injury or as examples of crimes that would?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48359 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think it can be read either way, although I think even the Government's brief in -- or the Respondent's brief in Taylor talks about extortion and burglary being crimes that can be Official committed with no risk of physical injury to another person and yet Congress still specifically enumerated those --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48360 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Crawford, if you had that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word "otherwise". You would have simply said is burglary, arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk. The other purpose of the "otherwise," which means in some other manner, some other manner -- other from what? Other from the preceding ones. I don't think there is any sensible way to read it except, you know, in some other manner than these previously named crimes involves a physical risk; and that is what causes me to say, well, what's the least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and any crime you want to get into this residual category has to be at least as dangerous as that. As I've said, I think that's extortion.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48361 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Using that analysis, it's hard to figure out, but again the Government had this obligation or we submit the Government had this obligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglary to be any more dangerous.

I mean, if you're sitting around with your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under this provision, planning a burglary.

All we have to do, as I said before, is count and there are a lot of people who can do that. In fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to do it and that is the sentencing commission. So they have the tools. They have the ability. And so in the absence on a question like this of my being able to get anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a borderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as a Court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of what the sentencing commission did in the absence of better information from some other place?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48371 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the sentencing commission when they were interpreting the career offender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a Official guideline that is worded different than the --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48372 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # They're trying to find out the same answer to the same kind of question: How many of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being hurt? And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that question in a borderline case without trying to find the numbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I don't have them, why don't I look to the best, second best alternative, which is at least they could get them, and I hope they did get them before coming to the conclusion they did.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48373 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, they came to that conclusion dealing with whether a career offender provision should include attempted burglary not under the armed career criminal statute and they specifically recognized that. Moreover, when they dealt with whether they wanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing with career offender, which has, although it increases the guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it certainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero to 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense. So for those reasons, even if the sentencing commission feels that the career offender statute or Official guideline should include attempted burglary, that doesn't mean this Court should use that for the armed career criminal statute. Moreover, the career offender statute says it's only a burglary of a dwelling, although the armed career criminal statute says a burglary qualifies if it's a dwelling or a structure.

Burglary, arson. Have we ever held that the residual category or "otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury," that that has to be decided generically? I mean, if we could apply that residual category, not generically but according to the crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant has been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against the house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to me it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't it?

And what I'm getting at is the issue that at least was alluded to in the Jones case.

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48414 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think so, Your Honor. I mean Florida, in the State versus Hamilton case, we Official discussed in our brief, Florida has defined curtilage narrowly, strictly construed the word curtilage narrowly, to limit that concept to an enclosed area that immediately surrounds the dwelling. And the case discusses a couple of cases from various Florida courts of appeals where the courts construed the concept of curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana that was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling house, in another case a whiskey still that was a distance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house, that those were too far out to be considered part of the curtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds the dwelling that's associated with the intimate activities of the dwelling. So Florida -- and Florida -- and I think the Court should take the Florida Supreme Court at its word when it said it's going to strictly construe that concept, and when it said it's not going to construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable results, keeping in mind how serious the offense of burglary is. So I think the -- so the first step, I think, if you don't -- if you don't believe that the way Florida defines burglary is generic in the way Congress had in mind, I don't think you could conclude that it presents a categorically different set of risks such that it Official would even fall outside the otherwise clause.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48415 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # There are a number of Florida cases that involve open carports. How would you apply it there? Somebody, if you had a carport that's not fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the street, somebody walks into the carport and steals a garden rake?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48416 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think under the current, I think under the current statute, it has been amended since, since 1993 and '94, and -- which is relevant, the statute is relevant to this case. I think now carports are considered part of the dwelling itself, the structure itself but under -- but if it -- but under the Florida's concept of curtilage if the area was not enclosed, it was not enclosed by a fence or other structure it would not be considered part of the curtilage. And in fact, the State versus Hamilton case, it cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that had found a burglary that took place on a driveway, and noted that the court in that case hadn't determined whether the area, whether the driveway was enclosed. So it does -- the statute does -- the concept does require an enclosure and the area immediately surrounding the dwelling and I think it is very difficult to conclude that that, that defined in Official that way, in that limited way, that someone who's intending to get on to a residence into the area either in or right around the dwelling, that that person is not sort of categorically dangerous kind of person that Congress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of the paradigmatic offenses in the statute.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48417 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So in an ordinary city street in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes up to the house and starts to monkey around with the window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted burglary, not burglary, in Florida?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48418 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That -- yes. That is my understanding. If it was not enclosed.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48419 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # All right. So then I doubt -- then again I'm left at sea. I don't know how often that happens or is dangerous. So if I think that this is really a statistical question, and I think maybe it is -- and the Government is in the best position, they have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over there. So what about a presumption against the Government? In a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a statistical question, and the Government doesn't have Official any statistics?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48420 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think -- I don't think when Congress enacted this law that it expected the courts would have statistics available to --

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48422 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, there are several things you can do. First you can look at the text of the statute.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48423 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # I read the text several times.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48424 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Congress provided some guidance by setting out four examples of crimes that do present the type of risk they had in mind.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48425 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Correct. And here I think it might be less than burglary. And extortion, though one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or something and revealing a secret from the past -- many such crimes are threats of violence. I mean, and that just read through the statutes, and that's what they are aiming at. So I would say extortion is something that Official quite often could involve violence. But again that's cogitating. So I get to attempted burglary. I don't know. Now what do I do?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48426 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think -- I think you have to consider what Congress's purpose -- in enacting the statute, Congress directed your attention to the serious potential risk that an offense presents. I think that just -- and criminal law requires courts and juries all the time to take into account and to use their common sense and experience to judge the risks that are presented by a particular crime. I mean, the very concept of recklessness itself refers to a substantial disregard of --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48427 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Marcus, it is a lot easier to do that with respect to the facts and circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it generically -- you know -- picking out attempted burglary. It is very hard to do that. Why shouldn't we read this, this residual category to refer to the facts and circumstances of the particular crime of which the defendant has been convicted? The language enables you to do that. The term violent felony means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury, physical injury to another. Official Why can't we not, not interpret that to mean generic crime, but rather the particular crime of which this defendant stands convicted?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48428 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, all that -- this law has been interpreted for many years. No courts of appeals have, have construed that it way. They have construed it to require a categorical approach. And then if you look at the structure of the provision, Congress clearly with respect to the listed offenses had in mind a sort of a categorical approach that, while these courts had, sort of looking at one of these crimes on an ex post basis, it might not present any risk, the idea that these crimes categorically present a potential -- a serious potential risk of physical injury.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48429 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And would you agree, Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard excludes that interpretation? If you look at the particular crime?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48430 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think the Court referred both in Taylor and Shepard to the -- to Congress's approach. And under the statute, that sort of that it wants you to take a categorical approach to crimes that are inherently presented --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48431 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Didn't we -- didn't we also go further and say one reason to construe it that way is Official we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having sort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to establish -- you know -- the facts of old trials. There was an administrability analysis involved. I think there was. Yeah, I wrote Shepard. And I think that's what --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48432 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There was that as well. And I don't think it is beyond the ability of courts to take a crime, look at the elements of the crime, figure out what conduct is necessary to satisfy those elements and then use common sense and experience to make a judgment about how that -- the risks that are posed by that conduct. Looking at the situation --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48433 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Marcus, isn't there this -- this linguistic problem with the statute anyway? Because this language if it said -- that sometimes presents a serious risk, then the answer would be obvious. If otherwise it said that characteristically presents a serious risk, then it might be closer. And which do you think is the more normal reading of it? I think either is -- certainly fits the language.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48434 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And either --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48435 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Either means sometimes presents a potential risk of physical injury, then Official obviously they're all covered. Or if it says characteristically presents the risk, potential risk, then do you have to decide whether that, it is a characteristic of potential burglary that it -- that it does present this risk or that just once in a while it does.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48436 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. I think it's not -- no I think it has to, characteristically taken at a general level, the conduct required to commit a burglary, of getting --

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48438 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think it would. First of all, Congress --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48439 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why is it two or three percent?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48440 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The statistics he is referring to came out before Congress amended the statute in 1986 and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically Official presented a serious potential risk of injury.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48441 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I don't think that's perfectly clear. The "otherwise" language does suggest that you are right. But if the statute instead of saying "otherwise" had said, "or involves other conduct that presents a serious risk," which I think is a permissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but if it said that, then it is not -- you are not taking as a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent requirement but rather that they are eligible, whether or not they do.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48442 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, this Court interpreted the statute that way in Taylor -- I mean, I'm sorry, on page -- on page 597 of Taylor. I mean this Court said that Congress's choice of language indicates that Congress thought ordinary burglaries as well as burglaries involving some aspect making them especially dangerous, presented a sufficiently serious potential risk to count toward enhancement. I mean, that's right in the Taylor decision, and I think that has got to be the correct reading of the statute. Because why did Congress identify -- they created two categories of violent felonies. The first is with respect to an element of the offense that goes to targeting a person for physical harm. The second category are those crimes Official that don't necessarily target a person for physical harm but necessarily present, inherently present a risk of physical injury to a person.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48443 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That would be fine if burglary were the only thing that Congress said there, but it also said extortion.

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48444 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Congress identified it as a violent felony presumably because it believed it had -- it had the criteria.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48445 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but is the criterion "characteristically," or is the criterion whatever minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48450 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't agree, Your Honor. The statute directs you to consider the serious potential risk.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48451 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # One way to do that is to say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of the harm that comes from the commission of the crime itself. I mean, there is -- I don't want to overdo it, but the risk of harm to others from the -- from the step on the ladder is zero, if you consider simply the act itself of putting the ladder up against the building and taking the step. It's only because that creates the potential for getting inside where the risk, in fact, is measurable. I mean, we know there are cases in which victims get shot when they appear in the course of burglaries, but the risk associated with the mere attempt in isolation is going to be minuscule.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48452 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # When you're assessing the risk presented by particular conduct, I think you have to Official take into account the intent that goes along with that conduct.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48453 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Oh, I agree with you. But the act that involved -- the act that constitutes the -- that qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it. I'm trying to help you here. I mean --

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48455 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Why do you look at the risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of lesser included offense? I mean, attempts themselves have their own independent risk of physical injury. Obviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of my house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's a risk of injury there, even though there's no -- regardless of whether the person gets into the house or not. And I think perhaps there's even a greater risk of potential -- greater potential risk of injury with respect to attempts because they don't succeed. Why don't they succeed? Because something interrupts them. And what interrupts them, it may well be the home owner. So I don't know that you have to look to sort of attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself. Official
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48456 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Congress doesn't look to attempt as a lesser offense. We pointed out in our brief that the vast majority of provisions in the U.S. Criminal Code punish the attempt the same as for the completed offense. And if you think about the purpose of the ACCA, and the ACCA is not focused on the results of the prior crimes of the armed felon committed, it is focused on the risk, the propensity that somebody has, has demonstrated by engaging in at least three prior violent felonies or serious drug offenses to engage in behavior that is dangerous, that presents dangers to public safety. So if you think about the attempt and the whole concept of attempt, I mean, someone who has committed attempt by definition has intended to commit the offense and as you said, Mr. Chief Justice, has only failed by reason of an unforeseen event. Why would Congress in this statute want to differentiate between the frustrated burglar whose only -- who hasn't succeeded only by virtue of an unforeseen event, and the successful burglar? I think the serious potential risk language allows you to sort of look at the attempt as you said, Mr. Chief Justice, as virtually the equivalent --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48457 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # I would suppose the unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical Official injury than the successful burglar.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48458 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Arguably. I mean, if you look at the case law, the vast majority of cases, the furthest out, the furthest case the Petitioner can find, the most extreme case that he's found involves someone who's in the backyard of a dwelling reconnoitering or casing the dwelling, and that was the most extreme example. So even with attempts, you find in all the case law, you do find the physical proximity to the premises. And one of the main reasons it wouldn't succeed is because somebody, there's the presence of someone who frustrates the entry. So that even on that level, at that level, it is hard to say that there's any lower risk presented by the attempt.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48459 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, what do you say about your brother's argument that the statistics show there's a 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of violence in the course of committing the burglary? I take it there isn't any statistic available, if we want to take Justice Breyer's approach, about the potential -- the actual proven potential for violence at the near attempt stage.

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48461 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No, I don't think you do either, but I mean, I think your whole argument has got to rest really on the potential for harm in the commission of the offense.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48462 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's the very reason that attempts are prohibited, because they present the serious potential to produce the harms that the completed offense presents.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48463 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Do I correctly understand, we don't need the statistics, I guess they're not available, but in your view if we did have statistics and they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the category of crimes across the nation, there was this risk, that would be enough?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48464 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # For attempts?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48465 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes. Well, for attempts or complete -- I mean, just say the standard of what presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if 1/10 of 1 percent of the crimes -- whatever the category, did present such a risk, that would be sufficient under your view.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48466 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, I think Congress wanted to treat a frustrated burglar the same --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48467 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The answer is yes?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48468 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. They've shown the same Official propensity to engage in the conduct that Congress was concerned about that falls at the heart of the statute.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48469 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So then it's a really easy case, because really there is some risk in every case. There's some risk that somebody will, you know, bump into somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48470 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But that's not what we're asking the Court here. We're asking the Court to look at the elements of the offense, and to look at the elements of the offense to see whether that creates a situation in which violence is likely to arise. Here you're talking about, this is attempted burglary of a dwelling where you have --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48471 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but none of the elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical injury in the burglary case. You can have unarmed burglars.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48472 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But in considering the conduct involved in the offense, the attempting to get, the attempt to enter a dwelling, enter someone's home, someone's residence, that creates a dynamic situation in which violence could occur --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48473 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Right. And as I understand your view --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48474 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That doesn't -- Official
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48475 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # If in 1/10 of 1 percent of the cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation, that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48476 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. But again, first of all, I don't think the statistics would show that. I don't think logically they would show that in light of the numbers that are shown for completed burglary. But again, I don't see -- with respect to the offenses that are covered that are at the core of the statute, I don't see why you would distinguish between the person who tried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen event. They have created the same set of risks, they've triggered the same set of risks that the successful burglar has.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48477 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So in other words, you're saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider not just what this particular defendant succeeded in accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to accomplish?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48478 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct. I think the statute permits you to do that with its plain language of focusing on the potential risk of the conduct, the serious potential risk. And that -- and also in looking at the rationale for attempts and why we punish attempts, in terms of the person is, you get punished Official for attempts because you sufficiently manifested your dangerousness in the same way as someone who's completed the offense. Again, the State codes, the vast majority of State codes demonstrate the riskiness of attempt behavior. They predicate felony murder convictions on attempted burglary as well as burglary. And as I said --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48479 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # What about attempted assault? I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an attempted assault.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48480 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think, my understanding would be that would be covered under the first subsection for the use -- attempted use or threat, threatened use of force.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48481 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # All right. But it wouldn't fit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens when you try to get away from numbers. Maybe there are a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during an embezzlement and start hitting each other. I can't get away from the numbers.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48482 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But there in those type offenses, if you look at the elements of the offense, there's no nexus between those elements and the -- a reaction that someone might have just to being Official prosecuted. I mean, that's not --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48483 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So what's the test? The test is either a high statistical number of injuries or if not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high statistical number of injuries? I like the word nexus because whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no idea what it means. (Laughter.)
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48484 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in this statute you're talking about career criminals, people who have committed a number of crimes and have recently just been convicted of being an armed felon. And I think that's -- when you look at -- that can be your starting point, and take -- so this case doesn't present questions about other cases that might present -- arguably present, or present a serious risk of physical injury, but don't necessarily seem to fit with the crimes that are listed and what the crimes that Congress had in mind. I think that's another case. This case falls at the core of the statute; we're talking about someone who intends to commit the core crime Congress was talking about.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48485 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Mr. Marcus, assuming we accept your view about the way the statute should be read, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage Official possibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that burglary in Florida is not a generic burglary?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48486 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We haven't argued that it is generic burglary. That's correct.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48487 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # I guess my -- so that leads me to this question, because -- I mean, I, my understanding is it's not a generic burglary. Therefore, even on your reading of the statute, an attempted burglary in Florida doesn't necessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in under the residuary clause, of course. And because there is a possibility that the only burglary charged was a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to -- don't we have to send the thing back to find out either from court records whether something more than a mere penetration of curtilage was involved here? And if so, whether -- whether that penetration carried with it the potential for harm?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48488 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I mean, no. That's why you have the otherwise clause, to cover offenses just as this Court said in Taylor, that they weren't --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48489 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No, but the only thing we know under the otherwise clause, is that this was an attempt at burglary. If the burglary were a generic burglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the Official end of the case.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48490 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48491 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But this is not a generic burglary. Therefore, we have to assume that the attempt in this case could have been nothing more than stepping across the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over to take the apple. And therefore, don't we have to go to court records? In other words, don't we have to take advantage of the qualification in Shepard and Taylor before this case can finally be decided?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48492 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. I mean, you've identified an additional step that the Court has to consider in deciding the question in this case, but that step doesn't necessarily require you to go to court records. I mean, it's our position that even including the curtilage, the area, enclosed area immediately surrounding the dwelling presents a serious potential risk of physical injury
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48493 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, could you tell us what your position is if we choose to use the noncategorical or the modified categorical approach? Is there a nexus between what's in the presentence report and some other charging documents, or is it just in the presentencing report?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48494 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. The charging documents are not part of the record in this case. The record Official right now is solely comprised of the presentence report.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48495 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # And we don't have any transcript of colloquies with the court or anything like that?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48496 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48497 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, what about -- do you think the facts in the presentence report are admitted by your opponent or not?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48498 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # He didn't object to the facts in the presentence report. He also did not object --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48499 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Therefore, can we consider them?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48500 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48501 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So therefore, then the question is whether throwing the hammer through the window is sufficient; is that right?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48502 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, that would resolve Justice Souter's question about whether it would involve the curtilage at all, which would show that there was an attempted physical entry into the residence.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48503 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Would you think that the hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do look at the individual case?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48504 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, we don't -- yes, certainly we think that any attempted burglary of a Official dwelling presents a serious potential risk categorically. But if you didn't agree with that, then, and you thought that only a subset of attempted burglaries of dwellings would present serious potential risk, then clearly this offense here that would certainly satisfy any conception of that.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48505 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Because the hammer is thrown through the window, is that -- I just want to be sure I understand your view of the importance of the hammer.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48506 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because there was an attempted physical entry into the residence. The person was right on the threshold of the dwelling.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48507 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I'm still a little unclear as to how much significance we pay to that hammer.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48508 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Again, we don't think you have to attribute any particular significance to that. I mean, it's our position that categorically this crime is covered. And again, the case law shows that there's -- that with attempted burglary cases, there is a physical proximity to the dwelling, but even if there was --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48509 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Even though there's some cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't involve any risk to anybody. Say the enterprising but careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see Official when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses to make his entry.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48510 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct. You can always posit, under the categorical risk, you could always posit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that equally applies to burglary as it does to attempted burglary. And so while you could posit a hypothetical where someone trying to get onto the curtilage might seem like it wouldn't present any injuries, if you think categorically about people who are trying to surmount, get over fences and walls to commit offenses in the dwelling or immediately around the dwelling, they're presenting the same sort of risk, and therefore the Court can conclude that it also -- within the otherwise clause, the burglary under Florida law is not so different from the kind of burglary that Congress had in mind that it would just drop out of the picture entirely. Armed felons who have the propensity to go into the curtilage of someone's home, to either go in the house or right around the house, present the very kind of risk that Congress was concerned about.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48511 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Do you agree that this presentence report cannot be consulted under the reasoning of Shepard, we need more?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48512 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, under Shepard, the Official defendant in Shepard had objected to the use of police reports. My understanding is he also submitted an affidavit saying he didn't acknowledge the truth of anything in the police report. So I think this case is distinguishable in that there was no objection to the facts in the PSR and there was no objection specifically to using the police report as the source for those facts.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48513 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # You don't think the PSR has some kind of significance that the police report did not?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48514 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It wouldn't, no. I don't think it would. But -- no.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48515 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Is the following sort of summary fair: Because Florida is not a generic burglary State, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy the burglary prong in subsection 2? But on your argument, even though Florida is not a generic burglary State, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the "otherwise" prong; is that correct?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48516 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Argument --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48517 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Is that a fair statement of your argument?
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48518 # TRUE # MR. MARCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. If the completed offense is a violent felony, the attempt to commit that offense Official is also a violent felony. That's a fair statement of our position.

argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48523 # FALSE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It seems to me that Respondent's position is taking the "otherwise" clause to trump the entire rest of the statute. Any crime, any felony, has a potential of violence. In fact, in footnote 9 of the reply brief we cited the Golden opinion from the Seventh Circuit and in that particular opinion the court found that serious potential risk for someone who failed to report to a jail because they speculate, you know, law enforcement might have to go and arrest them and there could be violence in that situation. Well, that happens in all crimes, the potential for law enforcement to arrest somebody. There's always a potential for violence. So the Government's position --
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48524 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It's different when you're dealing with an escapee or someone who has Official visitation right and then doesn't report back and qualifies as a escaped felon from prison. That's quite a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48525 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But there's still the same potential for violence in either one of those.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48526 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No. There's a greater -- I had this case in the D.C. Circuit. There's a greater degree of potential when you're dealing with someone who's escaped from prison than with someone else who's being arrested. Of course there's always the potential, but the judgment was that there's a greater degree of potential when you're trying to apprehend someone who's escaped.
argument in James versus United States # 05-9264 # 48527 # TRUE # MR. CRAWFORD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # For someone who's escaped. Golden wasn't dealing with that. Golden was dealing with someone who failed to report to a facility after being sentenced to do so. The same could be said for someone failing to report to a court for a hearing. A bench warrant is issued. The same type of risk would be inherent in that type of -- for that person as for someone who fails to report to a jail upon being sentenced. All of those potential crimes, basically that would leave open any potential felony to qualify under the "otherwise" prong. Congress obviously Official couldn't have intended that. Moreover, there's still an issue that was brought up in Shepard on the constitutional avoidance. How do we actually make these determinations and are these necessarily determinations that were found by the Florida court or by the Florida system for a Florida attempted burglary conviction? We submit it's not. And you're going beyond the mere fact of the prior conviction. You're looking at many other components, the risk of the conviction, which is not the same thing as the mere fact of the prior conviction. If there are no further questions --

But the enrollment, there was a barrier, and the pickaxe, that barrier was person satisfied as a quota. There were seats within the school. It wasn't at capacity. It wasn't near any one of the percentages or tipping percentages that the quota system in Jefferson County public schools applied. But she was not allowed in.

In other words, they want to assign children to schools that don't have the greater percentages of either African-American or Caucasian. So in Bloom Elementary, although it was 67-33 -- and keep in mind in kindergarten, according to their own rules and regulations, didn't even apply. The plan was so inflexible --

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47961 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Not an improvement exactly, but maybe from the Constitution's point of view. That Constitution wanted, as they said in the Slaughterhouse cases, to take people who had formerly been slaves and their children and make them full members of American society. And part of that was that the State couldn't insist that they go to separate schools. Now, the question from a constitutional point of view that you're being asked is how could that Constitution which says that this is intolerable, that segregated school, and insist that the school boards in Swann and elsewhere take the black children and white children and integrate them? How could the Constitution the day that that decree is removed tell the school board it cannot make that effort any more, it can't do what it's been doing, and we'll send the children back to their black schools and their white schools? That I take it is why the Court in Swann said explicitly that you could use race as a factor in the public schools when the school board so chooses. Now, that's the general question that I think Justice Ginsburg began and Justice Souter was following it up. And I would appreciate your response.

Supposing you had a city like Chicago with a neighborhood school system and in one neighborhood there was a school that was 100 percent African American, both student body and faculty, and up on the North Side there's a school that's 100 percent white, both students and faculty. Would it be permissible for the school board to decide that it would be healthy for both schools to have five African American schools in the North Side school and five white teachers in the South Side school?

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47979 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think if you build into the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was done in a way that made it express that the teachers were going to be moved, that you were basically going to have five and five, you were going to have a quota at the two schools on the basis of race, I would say that that would be unconstitutional. I would think, though, that there are many ways you can accomplish similar objectives without making it so explicit. And I do think that in this context, I mean, there is an independent constitutional value in not having these kind of express racial classifications drawn.

Are you an educational expert? I mean, the -- it seems to me from what I read, that there is a terrible problem in the country. The problem is that there are lots and lots of school districts that are becoming more and more segregated in fact, and that school boards all over are struggling with this problem. And if they knew an easy way, they'd do it. So I don't know whether this is exactly the only way to do it or not. I do know courts are not very good at figuring that out. And I guess that's why the Court previously has said it is primarily up to the school district. What's your response?

And I think that one is a little easier in the sense that I don't know of any school districts that have tried to maintain the kind of express quotas in teaching that he was indicating. I'm not here to tell you that this problem is simple to solve. I'm here to tell you, though, that I think the Constitution provides an answer.

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47986 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Stevens, let me tell you what I certainly think they could do, which is to say, look, you know, we don't have any balance in these two faculties. What we're going to do is we're going to mix some of them up, we're going to do it in a way that looks at a variety of factors, including who is good with young kids, who is good with older kids.

Now, some members of the Court may disagree with us on that. But what I would say is it probably doesn't have that great an import in practice, because although it is easy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the absolute and sole motivating factor, I think in this context in particular, I mean, nobody -- you know, nobody is trying to do this solely for a race-based motive. In this context, they also have an educational goal.

And maybe I'm missing something. But I think that -- you know, the dual school system predated the court ordered decree, which is part of where we have gotten to with resides schools and the like. If I can come back to the facts of this case, I think it's important to recognize that he was denied transfer to Bloom, even though there were empty seats available at Bloom school. So if he had been an African-American, he would have been allowed to transfer to Bloom. Instead, he was prevented. And there was an empty seat sitting there in that school. And that's why I think this case does prevent a very stark racial quota.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47995 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # May I ask you this, and I think this applies to the case we have got, as well as to Justice Stevens' hypothetical. You said in Justice Stevens' -- in answer to Justice Stevens' hypothetical, that they could achieve a result, legitimately achieve a result of racial mixture within the respective faculties of these schools if they took other things in addition to race into consideration. You mentioned ability as teachers and so on. But at the end of the day, the object of doing this, which Justice Stevens' hypo assumed, and I think the object of doing it which your answer assumed, was the achievement of racial mixture in the faculties. My question is: Why do thy have to hide the ball by saying, oh, we're going to consider these other things, ability to teach, educational credits, whatever you could come up with when at the beginning and at the end, the objective is to achieve a racial mix? Why can't they do that candidly and employ a criterion that candidly addresses that objective?
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47996 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Souter, there are several responses. One is that the Constitution puts a particular premium on avoiding express racial classifications.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47997 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And it has developed that concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to hurt or to stigmatize. Here, there is stigmatization going on as between black and white, when we say there is a value in mixing them up. Therefore, why should that same concern about referring to race at all be applied in this case.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47998 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Souter, you may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it was clear there was stigma going on, but you have extended it in Croson and in Adarand across the board. And I have to say --
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 47999 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We have extended it in cases in which benefits were being denied.

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48003 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But that is simply another way -- when you say it is the choice that's being denied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis, that is simply another way of saying you may never use the means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the educational objective. You're saying the same thing in a different way.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48004 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That may be, Justice Souter. But what I guess I would say is the logic of your argument would certainly require reconsideration of the Gratz case. And this Court in that context thought that individualized consideration even if it was going to be very difficult in the context of the University of Michigan's 25,000 admissions to the undergraduate program, this Court said individualized consideration was part of the constitutional guarantee.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48005 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In Gratz, the characteristics of individuals that could be considered were arguably relevant to a distribution decision. Here, the sole point is not to achieve a quota by relaxing other standards. The whole point is to achieve a value which comes from mixing the races, from distribution. And, therefore, why is it appropriate to look to other things as opposed to looking at that candidly, if that is a legitimate objective?
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48006 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because I think, Justice Souter, if you think it is an important value to have a degree of integration in the schools, well, I think you can take race neutral means that will get you a degree of integration in the schools.

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48007 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But you may use those race neutral means only for the purpose of achieving that mixture. I take it that's the assumption of your answer.

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48011 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Why is -- I'm trying to find out -- I understand what you think of Gratz. We can agree or disagree about that. But the overall view of the Constitution, that interpretation that you have in your mind, if it really forbids it, no use of race, I mean, basically -- all right? Think -- go back to Cooper versus Aaron. Go back to the case where this Court with paratroopers had to use tremendous means to get those children into the school. That's because the society was divided. Here we have a society, black and white, who elect school board members who together have voted to have this form of integration. Why, given that change in society -- which is a good one -- what -- how can the Constitution be interpreted in a way that would require us, the judges, to go in and make them take the black children out of the school? See, my objection to your approach to the Constitution is primarily a practical one.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48012 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I understand that, Justice Breyer.

That's what narrow tailoring meant. And I think that's what -- you know, Justice Kennedy made the point in his opinion in Grutter that the problem with approving the first blunderbuss opportunity that you see to use race in a context is that then you deprive the courts of any role trying to refine matters, and seeing, maybe the racial situation would be narrowly tailored, but it is sure not these 50-15 bands.

In the very case where the court, Hampton II, where the same district court found unitary status, he then because the Equal Protection Clause was not shielded by the decree, had to apply it to the use of these same racial bands in the context of magnet schools. And what did this same district court judge find there? He found they operated, quote, as a hard racial quota. Because the effect of these 50-15 bands was to keep hundreds of seats at Central High School, a popular magnet school empty, and away from African-American students because the district wanted to maintain its predetermined racial balance.

That argument was rejected by the district court. If I can go back to the judge's finding about the magnet schools, what is so interesting is the same judge finds the same guidelines to be a hard racial quota as to the magnet schools, but not as to the neighborhood schools. Why does he make that distinction? Because he finds that the neighborhood schools are basically equal, and therefore, denying a student an opportunity to attend to one rather than another was not an injury of constitutional magnitude. But I would have thought it is far too late in the day, and the Chief Justice suggested this as well, to say that just because two schools are basically equal, you can deny a student the right to attend one, and assigns one and only one based on his race.

For example, the District Court found that this plan makes our public schools more competitive and attractive and results in broader community support for those schools.

And the school board could decide we would like our race to get into those better white schools. Not because we want mixing. We just want, want them to get into those schools. Wouldn't that be a situation in which the board could then come up with a -- you know, these good schools ought to have 80 percent blacks in them? I would not consider that a benign objective.

And with respect to history, Your Honor, it is somewhat complex, because although the Court ruled in the Hampton case in 2000 that the degree was dissolved then, the board honestly felt beginning in 1981 that the decree had been dissolved. And so the board in 1984, 1991, 1996 made what it thought were voluntary modifications to the plan. Beginning in the late 1980s, the board began to introduce more choice into the system including magnet schools, magnet programs. The board uses race neutral lotteries to determine enrollment in some schools. But the board feels and it feels very strongly based on conversations that board members and staff people have had with other school districts that have tried race-neutral measures including Charlotte Mecklenburg, Wake county and San Francisco -- that race-neutral measures alone will not do the job and the experience in those districts indicates that they will not do the job.

MELLEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I would say that the starting point was that plan. The board has modified it considerably since then to make assignments more stable and predictable, to make the use of race more narrowly tailored. It is in concept the same plan, because it has some of the features, but the board has added many features that that plan did not have. The 1975 desegregation decree was really quite a blunt instrument and that's why it was so controversial in the community. That's why there was massive white flight. This plan, this board has very wisely modified that plan to make it much more acceptable to the community so that we stopped the white flight. We stabilized our enrollment. We have a community now that very broadly, the public opinion surveys show, that supports racial integration whereas in 1975, they were opposed to it, sometimes violently. This is as I said at the outset a success story.

One of those schools, Central High School, is far outside the racial guidelines. It has a black enrollment of about 83 percent. At two of those other magnet schools black enrollment has declined. It's declined by about by about a third in two of those schools. And that is only in the space of a few years.

That's -- there are some other surveys, I believe, that include the entire community. But I think you'll see in the record some that are parents only. I would like, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, to respond very briefly to some of the facts concerning Joshua, because you asked about that. There is nothing in the record that says that Ms. Meredith moved into the district in Florida just when she showed up at Breckenridge-Franklin. With respect to her appeal, in fact the litigation had not commenced when she would have had an opportunity to file an appeal. The stipulation of facts says that she did not apply for Joshua for the first grade. Now, Ms. Bloom -- excuse me. Ms. Meredith -- and this is not in the record because it took place after the record was closed -- but Ms. Meredith reapplied for a transfer after Joshua finished the first grade. That transfer was initially denied. She appealed. The transfer was granted and Joshua does now attend Bloom. I think that's relevant because the Solicitor General made an argument in his brief that this plan allows the student to be trapped in a school. We would certainly not agree that an assignment to any one of our fine schools could be a trap. But in any event, students can reapply each year and that has happened. It happened here in the case of Joshua --

I think it simply sets the outer limits within which our process of choice and other methods of assignment works. Without that boundary, it could be transgressed one student at a time. The guidelines I think are very much like the little boy in the Dutch story who put his finger in the dike because a few drops of water were coming out. He knew it would become a flood eventually if he didn't do that. We think that is exactly the case here, that without these guidelines one student at a time could transgress them and ultimately we would have a resegregated school system.

We're not challenging standing. We're simply saying that Ms. Meredith did not suffer undue harm within the meaning of this Court's decisions and that parents as a whole and students as a whole do not suffer undue harm. There have questions in the first case about an end point. I might address that briefly. We believe that the use of race in this plan is self-limiting in several respects. If racially segregated housing in Jefferson County continues to decline, which it has somewhat since the 1970s, and the board has reason to believe that the presence of racially integrated schools during that period contributed to that -- there are several amicus briefs that were filed in this case that set forth research that supports that conclusion. If racially segregated housing continues to decline and if this plan meets its purpose of diminishing racial stereotypes and promoting better cross-racial understanding throughout the community, we can foresee a time when this board will not see a reason to use this plan or may modify it further to make it even less restrictive.

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48124 # TRUE # MR. MELLEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I can't predict the future, Your Honor. I can say it could be shorter for another reason. That is that this plan is inherently subject to democratic review by elected school board and by the voters. It could end sooner than that if the board and the voters change their minds. I can't predict whether it might end longer than that. I can only say that this board has a long history of modifying the plan. As I said, they modified it in 1984, 1991, 1996, 2001. It's in the very nature of how a board of education works that they continue to tinker with things.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48125 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If the attitude is the one that this board has taken, then the same reasons would exist for the plan as long as there is segregation in housing.
argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48126 # TRUE # MR. MELLEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I wouldn't limit that, limit it to that, Your Honor. I think that an important factor are racial attitudes in the community. I think that this board feels that the plan does serve to ameliorate racial stereotypes, promote cross-racial understanding. Our community still has a long way to go in that respect. We do have some racial issues in Jefferson County. But we believe this plan helps them. And in the future a board may look at our community, may look at how racial relations work in our community, and may well decide that, even though housing is still somewhat segregated, we can do without this plan or again we can modify it to make it less restrictive, which in fact the history of this plan shows that this board has done.

MELLEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, it does not have fixed temporal limitation of 25 years or 10 years. As I said, that's not how school boards operate. But it is inherently subject to review on a temporal basis because each time we have a school board election the plan potentially is in play, and it could be modified at any time in that sense.

First of all, to respond to one of the questions that was asked, it's very important that it is equally consistent in the 1992 plan to effectuate or to prevent white flight that the plan itself was changed to subjugate African American kids to the worse performing schools. If you find that equally consistent, then you have a question of whether or not illegitimate notions of racial inferiority applied or racial politics applied --

argument in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education # 05-915 # 48137 # TRUE # MR. GORDON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, in the '92 plan and from that point on, which I showed, which was held in the Hampton plan, in the Hampton case -- in other words, in the Hampton case I proved, or the facts proved or the plaintiff proved, that African American kids were denied entrance into the better schools solely because of race. Within the vacuum of that case, there was also proof that showed the largest percent of African American kids were sent or denigrated or subjugated to the worse performing schools rather than the best performing schools. That becomes the question of racial politics and racial animus, and that's what the '92 plan did. And what it did to attract -- or prevent white flight, was have less African American kids go to the better performing schools on the entire K through 12 setting. That can't be what this Court wants to carve out as an exemption to the Equal Protection Clause. The Equal Protection Clause, that's on neutral parchment with black ink. There's no percents. There's no box to check. We can't have this in our school system, to have another 25 or 30 years in our school system, which will perpetuate racial isolationism because it does nothing to stop the achievement gap. There were race-neutral alternative tracks. All I can say is that, may this day be the embryonic beginning of Dr. King's dream, as paraphrased, that all children are now judged by the content of their character and their education, not by the color of their skin.

KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. In an effort to achieve its desired racial balance in its popular high schools, the Seattle school district denied over 300 children, both white and minority children, admission to their chosen schools solely because of their race and without any individualized consideration. This strikes at the heart of the Equal Protection Clause which commands that Government treat people as individuals, not simply as members of a racial class. This fundamental equal protection principle was reiterated in Grutter and in Gratz. The central question in this case is not, as the school district and many of its allies suggest, whether integration is important or whether desegregation is compelling. The central question in this case is whether outside of the remedial context, diversity defined as the school district does, as a white/non-white racial balance, can be a compelling interest that justifies the use of race discrimination in high school admissions.

Similarly, in our case, with the plaintiffs, they wanted to go to their preferred schools, schools that the school district acknowledges provided different educational opportunities, produced different educational outcomes, and they were preferable to the parents and children who wanted to go.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47725 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, when you state Justice Scalia is right, you are assuming, I think as your brief assumed, that the definition of the benefit to be received here is the active choice, not the provision of an education. Now the active choice may be of value. I do not suggest that it is not. Clearly the school district thinks it does or it wouldn't provide choice. But it is not the entire benefit that is being provided, and the principal benefit is the education, not the choice of schools. Isn't that correct?
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47726 # TRUE # MR. KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, they are both benefits. I would point Your Honor back to this Court's decision in Gratz, where the same analysis would apply.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47727 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But I think that the point that Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand it, is of course there are similarities to Gratz, they can choose, but there's a big difference. The similarity in Grutter, or the difference in Grutter and Gratz is that you had to prod a school that was supposed to be better than others, that the members of that school, the faculty and the administration tried to make it better than others. It was an elite merit selection academy. And if you put the black person in, the white person can't get the benefit of that. Here we have no merit selection system. Merit is not an issue. The object of the people who run this place is not to create a school better than others, it is to equalize the schools. That's in principle and in practice, if you look at the numbers, you see that the six schools that were at the top, their position would shift radically from year to year, preferences was about equal among them. They have the same curriculum, they have similar faculties, and I don't think anyone can say either in theory or in practice, that one of these schools happened to be like that prize of University of Michigan, a merit selection system. That, I think, was a major difference that he was getting at, why is this not the same kind of thing? That was at issue in Grutter and Gratz. Now what is your response to that?
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47728 # TRUE # MR. KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, we have several responses. The first is that the premise of Your Honor's question is that the schools are in essence fungible for purposes of providing a high school education. And I would direct Your Honor to the District Court judge's decision, a footnote in the decision in which she acknowledged that the schools were not of equal quality, that they provided different levels of education.

What I said was that the object of the school board and the administering authority was to make them roughly equal. I said that in terms of curriculum and faculty, they're about roughly equal. And in terms of choice, what you see is a wide variation in choice by those who want to go as to which is their preference among six schools over a period of five years. And that suggests a rough effort to create the equality, not an effort as in Michigan, to run a merit selection system.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47733 # TRUE # MR. KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, I think that the fundamental command of the Equal Protection Clause is that government treats as individuals, not as members of a racial group. And that command I don't think is suspended because of the nature of a school's admissions process. That right is still possessed by the individual students, and if a student is entitled to be treated as an individual as opposed to a member of a racial group at a university level, it's Parents' position they are entitled to that same protection at the high school level.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47750 # FALSE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents assert an interest in addressing the most racially isolated schools in the district, yet their plan does not address the two most racially concentrated high schools in their district. They likewise have certain interests in diversity, yet their plan does not directly address diversity other than pure racial diversity, and they do nothing to assemble the kind of critical mass that was at issue in the Grutter case. In fact, if you look at the program and how it operates in practice, the triggering critical mass for the use of the racial tie breaker is when a student -- when a school has less than 25 percent white students or when it has less than 45 percent non-white students. There is nothing in the record or in social science that suggests that there's a radical difference in the critical mass based on the race of the students. Of course what explains that difference in the triggering critical mass of white students versus non-white students, the answer to that does not lie in educational theory, the answer lies in the demographics of the district. The district happens to have 25 percent more non-white students than white students, so they trigger the race tie breaker at a different point under those circumstances. With all respect to respondents, the answer to how this program works lies not in diversity but in demographics. They are clearly working backwards from the overall demographics of the school district rather than working forward to any clearly articulated pedagogical role.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47752 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that those decisions are different primarily because the resulting decision is not a racial classification. And if you think about it, when you had an overt racial classification, like you clearly do in these cases, then you naturally ask the strict scrutiny questions and look for a compelling interest. If instead you start with a race-neutral government action that doesn't classify people directly based on race, then I suppose you could try to do some kind of Arlington Heights-Washington Davis type analysis.

And Justice Kennedy, I will answer the hypo, but let me say it's easy for purposes of the hypo to say the sole reason was for race. In the real world, in fact I can't imagine that a site decision won't be based at least in part on concerns about the overall educational benefits. And I think that's important. The reason I start with that preface is because when you have mixed motives and a variety of factors I think you'd be unlikely to strike down that kind of motive.

I'm saying you start at a different departure point when you have an express racial classification. I think I'm trying to answer Justice Kennedy's question about what if you have a sort of a race-conscious goal at some level and that's why you select a particular site or you decide that you're going to invest in magnet schools and want to put a magnet school in a particular school district. My humble point is simply that in the real world I think you're unlikely to have the pure racial motive type objective. I would say that --

That's their objective and they're using a racial criterion criterion to get there. Would that be impermissible, to have a mix of teachers in all the schools?
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47760 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think if what they wanted to do is have an mix of teachers that might be okay.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47761 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, what would be okay? How would you get there other than having -- the point I'm trying to make has been made by others. Let me read from Judge Boudin's decision. He says: "The choice is between openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through some clumsy or proxy device." If you want to have an integrated school and you site the schools deliberately to achieve that objective, it's very hard for me to see how you can have a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.

If I put a period in there, then I would get to my strategic site selection, and I still haven't got your answer on that. You don't put a period there. You say: ". .have an unquestioned interest in reducing minority isolation through race-neutral means." And this brings up this same question Justice Ginsburg had. Isn't it odd jurisprudence where we have an objective that we state in one set of terms but a means for achieving it in another set of terms, unless your answer is that individual classification by race is, is impermissible, but other, more broad measures based on, with a racial purpose are all right?
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47766 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that's ultimately the answer, Justice Kennedy, which is there's a fundamental difference between classifying people and having the real world effect. I mean, in this case don't forget that there were 89 minority students that wanted to attend Franklin High School. They could not solely because of their race. At the same time, every white student who applied to Franklin High School was allowed in solely base would on their race.

Just to get back, though, again, we say that that avoiding racial isolation is -- I just want to make the point, we say that racial isolation is an important government interest. I think if you put this plan up against that objective, it solely fails, because there are two high schools that I think you would look at as being racially isolated.

Far more radical than anything that's at issue here. Then it adds: "To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities." That's what this Court said 35 years ago. Thousands of school districts across the country, we're told, have relied on that statement in an opinion to try to bring about a degree of integration.

And I think anybody that relied on that language in the wake of cases like Crosson, in the wake of Freeman against Pitts, that said achieving a racial balance for its own sake is not constitutional, and Bakke and Grutter against Gratz, that all said that racial balancing is verboten, I think those school districts would have been misguided in relying on that language.

A developer has a plan to build 500 units. Can the city say, we'll grant you the permit on the ground, on the condition that 30 percent of all the houses go to minorities? That means people will live together. Then we can have a school, a school that can be diverse.

MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, we have accommodated choice to the extent there are seats available. And then we go to family connections. And then we -- in operation, admit everyone who lives close to the school. And then as to those that live further away, we look to see what's the school's racial demographic. Is it significantly different than the community's? These schools we have talked about have been the objects of significantly more aggressive segregation efforts, and the board wanted to preserve those.

MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the board actually at every turn reflected in the record discussed whether it was necessary to continue the use of race, whether to narrow it, and eventually to end it. And I think it is in the joint appendix at 408, the superintendent's testimony of the, simultaneously the measures that the board was implementing in terms of resource allocation, implementation of new programs, because they realized that by diversifying choice, they could hopefully achieve some of these same ends, not as quickly, not as efficiently, but that they could achieve them. That's been indeed the entire trajectory of Seattle's integration efforts since the first Seattle plan.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47812 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But in Grutter we said, to shorten it just a little bit, at page 329-330 of the U.S. Reports, 539, "the law school's interest is not simply to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group because of race ... that would amount to outright racial balancing which is patently unconstitutional." And that seems to be what you have here.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47813 # TRUE # MR. MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that the term racial balancing has two significant meanings. One is a plan that does not foster a compelling interest. And second, a plan that is too rigid, a quota, for instance, that might not pass narrow tailoring given the context. In this case we're not after a rigid set of numbers, and certainly not after a rigid set of numbers for their own sake. The purpose was to have schools that had become diverse through integration efforts not stray too far from the community's demographic because we're trying to prepare students to live in those communities.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47814 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The problem is that unlike strategic siting, magnet schools, special resources, special programs in some schools, you're characterizing each student by reason of the color of his or her skin.

People brought a lawsuit. Then to stop that Seattle engaged in a plan that really bused people around on the basis of race. That led to white flight. That was bad for the schools. They then tried a voluntary choice plan. This is part of that plan. Then when they abandon this plan, they discover more segregation. Is that basically right or not?

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47842 # TRUE # MR. MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It, it may mean the board confronted with the circumstances might well make that decision independent of this litigation. But let me answer the specific. Let's take Franklin High School to begin with. In, in 2000, that school was -- had 25 percent white enrollment. In 2005, it had 10 percent white enrollment. In the ninth grade, which is really the, the level at which we see the effect of the segregation tie breaker, in 2000, the white enrollment was 21 percent; it was 8 percent in 2005. Go to Ballard High School on the other end. Ballard was 56 percent white students in 2000; it's 62 percent in 2005. The ninth grade class has moved from 46 percent white students to 58 percent white students. Keeping in mind that that school is now significantly less popular than it was, I think those effects would probably be, be more extreme. But the plan -- I want to emphasize, the plan was to try to disperse demand and to foster choices that would result in diversity, not to compel it. We do not --

And the board decided after many years of effort that it would no longer do that, but it was also of the firm conviction that it would allow students who wanted the opportunity to opt out of those schools to do so. At the same time, it implemented magnet schools at Rainier Beach, there's a new building under construction at Cleveland. And so --

And so people like choice; they also like neighborhood schools; they also like diverse schools.

I was saying, however, that if that existed, I think that would be something the board would have to be mindful of. As a practical matter, because our non-white ethnic neighborhoods in South Seattle are themselves quite integrated, that the movement under this plan did not produce disparities for or against any particular ethnic group. And so I think in the end it might have been more divisive to have individual tiebreakers for the separate minority ethnic groups.

But this is not like being denied admission to a state's flagship university. I think for that proposition, I would cite Justice Powell's opinion in the Bakke case where he was at some pains to point out that a school integration plan is wholly dissimilar to a selective university admissions plan.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47878 # TRUE # MR. MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It depends on what school you're talking about, Justice Alito. In this case, I think the most important point to start with is that there was no contention that there was any material difference in quality between the five popular high schools.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47879 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, if we looked at Garfield and Cleveland, what would we find?

MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # You would find a reasonable basis to perceive a quality difference between those two schools, but this plan didn't assign any students to Cleveland. I want to take a moment, if I can, to turn to the issue of individualized consideration, because so much emphasis has been placed on it in the earlier discussion. It seems to us, first of all, that this Court in Grutter said that not all uses of race trigger the same objections and that the Court must be mindful of the context. This is not, as I've said, a selective or merit-based system where we adjudge one student to be better than the other. We do consider individual factors before we get to race, starting with choice and family connection, and how close you live to the school. But ultimately, this is a distributive system which, as Justice Powell -- as I noted, Justice Powell said in the Bakke case, is quite wholly dissimilar to a merit or selective-based system. What it seems to us is being suggested by the United States and by the petitioner is a system that would force an individualized merit-based review on any kind of race conscious program, specifically an assignment to public schools. That rule allows the means to define the ends; and it ends up, I think, defeating the purpose that the Court had of not stigmatizing --
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47881 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But the reason that our prior tests have focused on individual determination is that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to ensure that people are treated as individuals rather than based on the color of their skin. So saying that this doesn't involve individualized determinations simply highlights the fact that the decision to distribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and not any other factor.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47882 # TRUE # MR. MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, in Grutter you said specifically that individualized review was required in the context of university admissions. In this context, the kind of review, the specific kind of review that I understand the United States to urge and the petitioner to urge, serves no purpose, and it may itself be stigmatizing in the context of public schools where everyone gets a seat.

MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, that is correct. I am saying, however, that this plan, consistent with narrow tailoring, provided consideration of individual circumstances, including an appeal on hardship grounds for someone who felt that they had been denied a school that they needed to be in.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47885 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But the emphasis on the fact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me is misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can get into the school that you really prefer. And that in some cases depends solely on skin color. You know, it's like saying everybody can have a meal but only people with separate skin can get the dessert.

MADDEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, like the Michigan cases, sometimes student in the end of the day have an assignment determined by race. Just like in the university cases, at some point race will be a tipping factor. It's different, though, when we put someone in a basically comparable school.

argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47899 # FALSE # MR. KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. There were some questions of my friend Mr. Madden about the record and the statistics about enrollment, and I'd like to draw the Court's attention, particularly Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens' questions about what the schools look like now. If the Court looks at pages 6 and 7 of our reply brief, we provided the enrollment data. The information on page 7 comes from the school district website that provides enrollment data at the individual schools. In 2005 and 2006, enrollment at the oversubscribed schools is now 54 percent non-white, which is greater than it was under the district's --
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47900 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # This is the -- as I gather, the plan where race is used, has to do only with the ninth grade. And therefore, what you would like to note is when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped using any racial criteria at all, what happened to those ninth grade classes. Did they become more heavily separated or did they retain their diversity? Are the numbers that you are about to read us, which I have in front of me, going to do that? Tell us that? I think they're about the whole school.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47901 # TRUE # MR. KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They are, Your Honor, but they're about the whole school after four years of operating without the race preference. So each of the four years they're represented in the aggregate shows the effect that I think Your Honor was asking about. So, the record in this case shows the Seattle schools are richly diverse. It's very important in our view that the Court not lose site of that. We've talked about integration and segregation, but I urge the Court to take a look at the data the petitioners submit regarding the actual enrollment in those schools. A couple of other record citations I'd like to bring to the Court's attention. Justice Kennedy, I think, asked about considering race at a last resort. It's simply not the case that the school district looked at race as a last resort. And I would draw the Court's attention to the superintendent's testimony at joint appendix 224 and 25, where he said in essence, the reason we didn't consider race neutral plans is because we were interested in racial diversity.
argument in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number # 05-908 # 47902 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # The numbers I have here, Franklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent. Roosevelt, which was basically a white school, jumped up from about 51 to 59. Ballard jumped up from about 56 to 62. Then Garfield went down some, more mixed. But those were the worst ones; am I right on that?

KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The numbers I was trying to bring to the Court's attention were the difference between the enrollment under the race-based plan and the enrollment in 2005 and 2006, which shows significant and continued racial diversity in Seattle's high schools. Counsel suggested also that there is no material difference among the five oversubscribed schools. And I would draw the Court's attention to the testimony of the board president at joint appendix 261 to 274, where she discusses in detail the programmatic differences. It is true that those five schools were oversubscribed and they were popular, but they all provide unique programs, some of which as we indicated in our briefs, required children to meet certain prerequisites to be able to attend.

KORRELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, I'm perhaps not the best person to answer that. I believe the board has been trying to introduce programs at all of its schools that would make each school unique, and I think that includes the undersubscribed schools as well. Justice Breyer asked a question about the -- about the process of this litigation, and my understanding is there was never a lawsuit against Seattle to compel desegregation, that they were always following a plan.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47442 # FALSE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Mr. Lawrence in this case made an application for relief in the state courts of Florida, that unfortunately was denied to him, the relief that he sought. Consequently, he came here to the United States Supreme Court on a certiorari review and the certiorari, although it was denied, he did present to this Court an issue on which it could have acted had it chosen to act. It is well within the power under 28 U.S.C. 2104 for this Court to modify, vacate, remand. In other words, this Court can and could have affected that judgment. Our position is that this -- there is a distinction between the, quote, "appellate jurisdiction" under 2104 and the original writ of certiorari which would lie in this Court in some instances. When one uses the appeal, one is not making a new application. We respectfully suggest that the utilization of the emphasis in 2244 should be on application and what was before this Court on petition for certiorari was the application, the document, the issues, which had been presented below in the Florida courts and this Court was sitting to determine whether it would --

And the issues which were raised were the same ones that were raised in the state court and were of constitutional dimension that Mr. Lawrence raised here.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47474 # TRUE # MS.

There is no reason to believe and there is much reason not to believe that Congress intended exhaustion has a concept which should be read into this particular context in which we're dealing. In point of fact, in the 1995 proposal for habeas reform the word "exhaustion" was in there. It was taken out in 1996. Unfortunately, the Congressional history and the speeches on the floor, etcetera, are not really illuminating, except the concept of exhaustion apparently the legislature, the Congress, felt would be subject to interpretation differently in different states.

I agree with the premise of Your Honor's question that it would be pending and it would be pending here and therefore, you should not go to district court and file a 2254. Now whether you can and you can do it in a protective fashion is another entire issue which isn't really raised here because he did seek certiorari review.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47491 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Do you read the tolling provision in 2263(B) the same way as you read the tolling provision that's before us?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47492 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. Certainly I do not. And the state really did not analogize to 2263 as I believe perhaps they should have analogized to it. 2263 of course is the opt-in provision which moves things along on an even quicker track than a one year, and you have 180 days to file, and the Congress was absolutely clear and this was enacted at the same time that the provisions at issue were enacted, that it was 180 days after final state court affirmance and you had to, you had to file. That's it.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47493 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Do you think Congress really wanted to have two different, entirely different tolling concepts in these provisions?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47494 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think they did, and one of the reasons that I believe that they did, number one was to achieve their goal of moving things faster if the states were able to guarantee counsel, and the second is that they told, as well, in 2263(B) the main difference between 2263(A) and (B)(1) is that the time when you're getting your certiorari petition ready for this Court under the opt-in provision is not tolled. But the time when this Court is considering the post-conviction certiorari request is tolled. It's tolled clearly by statute. I cannot presume and would not presume that what Congress did was write these in numerical order and when it got to 2263 come up with a new and exciting idea, and then not go back to 2254 and 2244 to change the language there. I think Congress meant something different. And what it meant was the trigger time, the time that was going to be elapsing between the petition, between your final decision and when you could go to certiorari.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47495 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # You know, what about 2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review? Your reading of D(2) is that that's what they meant when they said the state application was pending. The state application or the time for seeking review of the state application, and in -- just in just a few sections above that they expressly said that shouldn't we read pending in a different, different direction?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47496 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the distinction, I have at least two things to say about that. The distinction between the two sections, that would be (D)(1)(a) and (D)(2), one is dealing with one thing, a judgment which has reached finality and it is determining when that judgment is final. They would have had to rewrite the tolling provision because it is not speaking about a judgment. It is speaking about an application which is a process. And the second thing is that --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47497 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, they would have just said during the time of the application for state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of it.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47498 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I believe that Congress is presumed to have read, written its laws knowing the history of interpretation of this Court. And pending has a very long tradition and this Court's role in the state-Federal continuum obviously is of well defined 200 plus-year-old role, and the part of that role is that you as this Court are the final arbiters and the only true people who can make the decision about what the Federal Constitution says. The state would have you read this as if it says application for state post-conviction relief is pending in the state court. I would be hesitant to rewrite the statute since Congress did not invite me to do so as the state has actually done by saying, pending in the, in the state court. And that is not the concept that we have lived with for 200 years or 200- plus years. Pending means until it is, cannot be any longer acted upon, and it is clear here, you as this Court can upon it.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47507 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I thought your argument on brief was that it is pending here and the statute says pending. It doesn't say pending, as your statute, you compared it with says. That pending, the application is pending someplace. Where is it pending? Not in the state court anymore. They have reached their final judgment, but it's still pending in your case here because you filed a petition for cert.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47508 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, ma'am. It just is, also, I -- there is some case law which speaks to the fact that it remains pending or unsettled or unsure or unfinal when a court can order another court to act on it.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47509 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # In the same sense that it is pending after the trial court has acted but before the defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants a state appeal.

Whether it's still pending in the state trial court or in the state appeals court. But nobody denies that it's pending. And I understood your argument to be, whatever mending means there, pending means here because there is no modifier that would limit the same -- the same construction.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47512 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. That is -- that is so, sir.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47513 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But in what sense is it an application for state post-conviction review when it's pending before us? We are considering a claim that the state erroneously decided a Federal question --

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47515 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- but it's not an application, it's an application for our review, not state post-conviction review.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47516 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It began as a complaint. This is, analytically, everyone seems to have a little bit of pause because of exactly the context of your, of your comment, of your question. But there is only one lawsuit, complaint, whatever you wish to call it, which we are dealing with, and that is the one that seeks post-conviction relief in Florida. If you're unsuccessful there, you go to the Florida Supreme Court and that same application is what we come to this Court on. There is nothing else out there. The state seems to tell us, or suggest to us that it's some kind of an independent state -- uh, Federal action.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47517 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It's a Federal writ, isn't it? It's an application for a Federal writ. It's not an appeal in state criminal -- state case.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47518 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But it comes under this Court's appellate jurisdiction versus its original jurisdiction for writs of certiorari.

So the focus of it is still the state proceeding even though we may correct it under appellate jurisdiction.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47520 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, sir. The state brings forward an argument that this certiorari before this Court is not a part of, not an integral part of and in fact not any part of the state process. I believe they come to that conclusion because they insert what they wish the statute said, rather than what the statute actually says, and we are attempting as best we can to interpret what Congress did not, what you wish it did.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47523 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No. From the time of, I suppose the pertinent question would be from the time of final state, final state judgment, eventual filing for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our disposition? Presumably, probably five or six months?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47524 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It's not usually that long. This Court is very efficient with that. And that's one of the points --

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47529 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Then you get another month for the opposition depending on what circuit you're from for the extension. Get another month for the opposition, at least two months, month and a half, for us to dispose of it. It probably comes out to about six months.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47531 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Now I guess -- my question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of limitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly an additional six-month period would strike me as odd.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47532 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Your Honor, it is not a one-year statute of limitations per se. That may be what looks good on paper with the writing of the statute and the expressing of the statute to the public, that one year is what's going to happen. But when one takes into account the exhaustion requirement and takes that time out, we are still not talking about a 365-day process.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47533 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Let me ask on that, Ms. Bonner, what typically in Florida is the time elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal proceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral relief?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47534 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It's quite a while. Your Honor. I wouldn't know the average.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47535 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But it's more than six months, I assume.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47536 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It's a long time, Your Honor. And --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47537 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Two, three, four, five years.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47541 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # The question is whether there may be another six months added on to that five or six-year period.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47542 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, sir. And one of the important things here is --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47543 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, the reason that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the exhaustion of the state procedures. This additional period is when it's pending, not before the state but before a Federal court.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47544 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But it's the state petition which is pending for your review. And one of the things I want to point out is that the 90 days, when they passed habeas reform, they were not speaking about 30 days, 20 days, 60 days, 90 days or even the six months that Your Honor posits. It was 10 years, 12 years, 14 years. And that was I think the major impetus to encourage the Congress to put the 365 day on there. This Court has complete control over the certiorari process. You know, being lawyers we always do file at the last minute, but of course it's this Court's rules which gives us the 90 days versus another period of time. It is, the petition for certiorari is not like a notice of appeal, because it's not just a one-page document that's laid out in the Federal statutes for us to do. It's an application to, it's an application for review and it is, it takes some time to fashion.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47545 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Any -- any statistics on how many petitions for cert from state post-conviction collateral review are granted? In other words, if we are talking about an additional six months in every case, how many of those are actually granted?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47546 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't know how many are granted, Your Honor, but one thing that struck me as I was reading through these cases is that many are granted to the state. And of course, when the state goes to certiorari from post-conviction, from a post-conviction loss on its side, then the whole process is turned on its head, and many, many times this Court has granted certiorari to the state. And that is another problem that happens with this tolling if you read pending the way the state wants you to read pending, because what do we do then? What do people do?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47547 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No, but if the state is petitioning for cert it means you've won.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47548 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It means you've won.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47549 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So presumably you're not looking forward to further --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47550 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. But what happens to the time? How do you count that time if you lose here?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47551 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I suppose you'd have to file a protective petition with the district court saying we won but we might still lose.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47552 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I guess. And - you know, a protective -- to litigants, protective and to district court judges, I believe and state court judges, protective petitions are kind of anathema, because since you don't know what you're going to raise -- and in the 2254 you have more of an idea, certainly, because you're limited in many instances if not all instances to those things which were exhausted -- but obviously there are new claims that are brought up because there would not be a stay and abey. There would not even be a request for stay and abey if there were things that the Federal courts find.

BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'd be surprised too, but I've practiced a long time and I've seen some very odd things happen in courts and, both a stay and abey, and the other procedures that have been discussed by this Court have not been handed down as mandates to the lower court to require the lower court to rule in a certain way, or to absolutely stay, or to entertain protective motions and then permit those protective motions to be supplemented at a time later. If Your Honors do not mind, I will reserve some time.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47561 # FALSE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner's case amounts to no more than a disagreement with AEDPA's recognized policies and procedures, and an improper attempt to convert ignorance of settled law into an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable relief. AEDPA's plain language and recognized purpose is established, that tolling does not extend to the post-conviction certiorari process. Additionally, ignorance of settled law whether by an incarcerated pro se petitioner, by private counsel, or by appointed counsel is not an extraordinary circumstance and does not excuse prompt filing.

KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I believe that's correct, Your Honor, because statutory pending contemplates a finality, it contemplates -- and I think that this is, it is one of the fundamental problems, I believe, with petitioner's construction, is this ignoring of not only the plain language of the statute but what this Court has said about this statute, about 2244(d)(2). In Duncan this Court said that state, the word state modifies both post-conviction and other collateral review, and established that we are talking about a state application.

The relief as I understand it is going to consist of a remand to the state court saying you did something wrong on this application before, go back and do it over again and do it right. It's the -- it is the state application which is going to be the subject of it and that therefore, it is the state application that necessarily is the subject of the cert petition.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47589 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I would say, Your Honor, that the state application may be the subject matter of what you are looking at from a subject matter standpoint, but what the Court is ruling on is the petition for certiorari, which was a Federal court ruling on --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47590 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It's a petition for certiorari to review action taken on a state petition, just as at the state level, whatever may be the, the nomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial court to the state appellate court, is an application which relates entirely to the original application for relief that was filed in the state trial court. It seems to me the two situations are exactly parallel.

I mean, the judgment is what is being reviewed, and it is a final judgment in the application. The Florida Supreme Court in this case has no power at all once they have issued the mandate to go back and modify, to correct it six months later. If the Florida Supreme Court decided, you know, we made a mistake in that application, they don't have the power sua sponte to correct it. It is final. It is over. The state's province has been completed.

I think this would be, the only exception would be, to the rule that we are advocating would be in the unusual circumstance, the one in 5,000 cases, the one in 1,000 cases, the exceptional case where this Court actually grants certiorari, those cases are exceptional in and of themselves.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47601 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Those are the most likely where people are going to get mixed up. I mean, I'm not following -- I think I think this argument about the word is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both sides of this. I just can't get a clear answer. So if I were right about that and there is no clear answer from the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back to Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns are practical. If we take your position, we have words right next to each other, near each other in the same statutory provision, meaning different things. And I've learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up. And they will get mixed up all the time, and when they get mixed up, people will lose rights that they have. The second concern of Justice Stevens, which is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who intuitively are going to cause the problem. Because on a rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very good Supreme Court case. And that's going to be the case where he forgets to file in the Federal court because he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and behold, the Court grants it. And now what happens? On your interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other interpretation, it seems to work out fine. So those, I would say are the two practical problems, and anything you would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47602 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Justice Breyer, and I would respectfully answer your question I think in three ways. First, drawing a distinction between when the state petitions for certiorari and when the habeas petitioner petitions for certiorari. Under both circumstances, equitable principles would apply, but they would apply in I think different ways. But in either circumstance, the ability of the petitioner to subsequently seek habeas review would be protected. And so what we are advocating is not making those exceptional cases the rule. In a case where the state petitions for certiorari there isn't an ability, there is no way to even file a protective habeas because there is nothing to file. You've won, the habeas petitioner has won in the court below. There is no cause of action. There isn't a basis upon which to file a Federal habeas claim, so even a protective one would be, it wouldn't be premature, it would be effectively nonexistent. So from an equitable standpoint, the extraordinary circumstance which the courts have recognized, the circuits have recognized that the test for equitable circumstance is, the extraordinary circumstance would be this Court accepting certiorari. And then the exercise of diligence on the part of the petitioner is if the petitioner did everything he or she could under that circumstance, because there would be no way for that petitioner to file for a Federal habeas review because there would be no basis for it.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47603 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Can I ask -- it seems very strange to me. I can understand protective filings when you've lost, but it seems to me a very strange protective filing.

Why can't you use, why isn't it most sensible to use the model when -- for the time clock on direct appeal, say there has been a conviction affirmed by the highest court of the state, when does the time, when does that judgment -- it's a final judgment if you seek cert, right? But the time clock, the one year doesn't begin to run until after the 90 days has elapsed; isn't that right?

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47621 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So why shouldn't it be the same way for collateral review as it is for direct review? Direct review, everyone agrees that you get the state final judgment. But then you have 90 days and nothing starts until that 90 days is up or, if cert is granted, until the cert process is done. Why shouldn't it be just the same for collateral review?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47622 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I would say it's different, Your Honor, respectfully, for two reasons: One, because this Court has said that direct review is different in numerous cases. And two, because the statute makes that distinction. Congress in (d)(1)(A) utilized that very specific language that included the, the certiorari period and in (d)(2) did not use that language, and it is the absence of that language that indicates that tolling is only to apply while a petitioner is exhausting relief, state relief.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47623 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well that means, that means that if a petitioner who has had his state application for collateral relief denied wants to petition this Court, but doesn't want to lose out on the possibility of seeking Federal habeas, that prisoner has to do two things at the same time: One, prepare a petition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare a complaint to file in a Federal district court. That's a lot to put on a person, particularly the one who isn't represented.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47624 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I would say that in many circumstances that would be the case, but not always the case. It depends on how much time is left on the Federal statute of limitations, how much time is remaining, how long did it take to get through the state post-conviction process. How timely was the filing in the state post conviction process. And how much time is remaining, assuming for what was discussed --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47625 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Here there were 31 days, right?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47626 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Then they would need to file -- yes, Your Honor, and they would need to --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47627 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # They'd have to file a Federal court complaint and a cert petition within the 31 days.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47628 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor, because the amount of time that would elapse before this Court were to rule on the cert petition would consume that 31 days. And I don't think that's inconsistent with what Congress intended here because what Congress intended by this provision was to provide petitioner -- well, what this Court said in Duncan, what this Court has recognized, is that the scheme that has been put together here by Congress is one which encourages petitioners first to file and exhaust their state remedies, recognizing and giving deference to the principles of comity, and then second to file, once they're done with their state process, once they've completed the state process and exhausted their state remedies, to file their Federal habeas, in the words of this Court in Duncan, "as soon as possible." And the anomaly that would be created by petitioner's construction would be it would be the only time under all of AEDPA where a petitioner could file in Federal district court but isn't required to file. And so I would submit to this Court that it cannot be both exhausted and pending at the same time. It would not fit within the scheme that this Court has already determined the structure of (d)(2) is designed to accomplish. The principle is that you are to, as a habeas petitioner, go quickly to state court, and we're going to give state courts the first opportunity at these Federal constitutional questions. And yes, Justice Stevens, it may take some time. It may take several years in Federal -- in state court, before they accomplish that purpose. But that's the state's issue because it's the state's judgment and the state is taking its time and it shouldn't be -- and this is what Congress recognized I think in (d)(2) -- that, that, that the petitioner should not be penalized for that time. That's why it was tolled.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47636 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I would respectfully say to Your Honor that it's not an automatic stay. I mean, perhaps there would be a stay at some point. But there are things that can be accomplished in Federal court before the undertaking of the review. There is the Rule 4 screening process in habeas. There is the initial review by the district court to see if the filing itself meets the procedural requirements. There is the asking for an answer by the state. There is discovery that can take place. All of this can take place while the cert petition is pending before the Federal district undertakes any review of the merits. Now, if there gets to be this juxtaposition where it looks like there is going to be a conflict between the Federal district's court's review of the substantive merits and that is going to conflict with this Court's certiorari review, well, then I think a stay would be implemented.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47637 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, I'll accept your view as being the personal experience. I'm rather surprised that district courts would go through all of these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and they may not have to.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47638 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, they may not have to --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47639 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # I'm not sure if I would tell the district courts that's what they ought to do, is a wise expenditure of resources. I'll think about that.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47640 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, I mean, it sort of depends on how often cert is going to be granted, doesn't it? If you're a district court and you have hundreds of these habeas petitions being filed, you can either hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed, one in one thousand or whatever the number is, because they might be granted. I think you'd probably take your chances depending on the petition. If it looks serious and there's a petition pending you don't have to proceed. If it's frivolous perhaps you can proceed.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47641 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that's exactly right, Your Honor. I think that's really the point, and you've obviously articulated it better than I did in my previous answer. But that's exactly right, that --
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47642 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But isn't it true the real problem with the capital cases? The state's interest in getting things moving is the strongest in the capital cases, I think.

Florida # 05-8820 # 47644 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # In the non-capital cases there is an interest in promptness, but the longer the guy stays in jail is not going to prejudice the state. But you do want to get your death cases terminated as soon as you can. And what we're really talking about as I understand it is whether in most death cases we'll add on a period of six, eight, nine months to the total period. And in most of those death cases, which is a limited number -- I don't know, you have a couple hundred people I suppose in death row -- in those cases it's going to be seven, eight, nine years anyway.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47645 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it may be that long. It may be a shorter period. But I think what we need to look at is not what we would think would be the preferred time frame, but what Congress said was the preferred time frame. And Congress is saying that it's one year, and the only time it's tolled is when the petitioner is doing what it should be doing to exhaust state remedies. That's again what this Court said in Duncan about describing this entire structure.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47646 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That's if you're formally right on the metaphysical question. But if you're not, now thinking you just gave a response to the Chief Justice that said, well, really the Federal district judge when he gets these things just has to look at them and then he figures out whether he is going to stay it or whether he's going to proceed on some issues or whether he is going to do something else. And that's what you thought was fairly easy. You have the experience there and I just wonder how easy it is. I mean, why wouldn't it be easy? Because I guess before doing anything the judge has to know what this thing is about. And that's where it seems to me to take the time of a district judge. They have many, many petitions. Sometimes they are well organized, sometimes not. He sends them to a magistrate possibly. The magistrate has a lot to do, and the time consumed is the time finding out what is this case about. Is that fair characterization or not? How easy is it?
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47647 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think it's partly fair, Your Honor. What I would say is the time -- certain time is consumed just determining whether or not under the Rule 4 screening process, whether or not the petition meets the formal requirements, whether they've articulated the claim in the correct way and whether it's worthy of the state response, if there's discovery that needs to be had. I mean, all of these things can be taking place and in the one in one thousand or perhaps more than that -- and I don't pretend to have the exact number or the statistics -- but in the very, very usual circumstance where cert is actually granted, I think then a stay could be put in place. And I don't think it's fair to say, respectfully, that Congress intended to forestall this entire process while this Court undertakes certiorari review.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47648 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Kise, there are two applications. Your answer to the petitioner is you have to file in the Federal court within that 31 days. If a prisoner says, I can't manage a cert petition and a Federal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get any assistance, so I'll have to pick one or the other, isn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that you're proposing going to be an incentive or a disincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a right to do? He is going to have to pick one or the other if he is in this timeline.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47649 # TRUE # MR. KISE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, respectfully, Your Honor -- and I know that that is the petitioner's argument and I see that you have given me that question, but I don't know that it is that much of a choice. I mean, I think that they can file, they can file both in those circumstances and, and depending on the particular circumstances -- and this is back to the equitable tolling principles -- for statutory tolling purposes, I think the answer is they must file both or they forfeit the right to one or the other. If they choose not to file for cert, then they voluntarily if they pass the 90 days forfeited that right; and if they don't file within the statutory period then they have under AEDPA missed the statute of limitations deadline. But I would, I submit to you that it is possible to do both, and in circumstances where there is some impediment to them doing just that, if they exercise diligence, if they are doing everything they possibly can and it is not possible to file both at the same time, well, then I think under the facts of the proper scenario that equitable principles might apply. But again, to say that Congress built into the system this automatic time period that's going to be tacked on to a very short one-year statute of limitations, a statute of limitations that is designed to really move things through the system rapidly, is, respectfully, I don't think the correct interpretation of the language, and I don't think it is consistent with what this Court said in Duncan or, with respect to Justice Breyer, what this Court said in Carey.

Kind of what we're getting here is, we won't be objecting to a stay if there is a stay requested. However, they objected to the stay here that the United States district court entered. In an exercise of honesty, he said: I'm going to wait for the Supreme Court to decide what happens in Artuz, whether they accept cert or not. And they vigorously. Objected and utilized a good little built of time litigating it on an interlocutory type appeal. One of the practical problems is if this case is in both courts, this one and the United States district court, where is the record? Is -- It's just the most practical of things.

If Congress was concerned that people were stringing out the time before they seek habeas, one way to string it out under your reading, but not under the state's reading, would be to file a petition for cert.
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47664 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Congress couldn't have been too concerned about that 90 days because it certainly permitted the trigger to have the 90 days included within it, and this Court has allowed the 90 days --

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47667 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes. When they wanted to include the 90 days, they said the expiration of the time for seeking review. They did not say that in (d)(2).
arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47668 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They did not say that, but they said while the application is pending. And the state did not address for this Court what is pending here if it's not that application from state court.

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47672 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I mean, if the defendant had no incentive to delay, why did Congress think it necessary to impose the statue of limitations?

arguments in Lawrence V. Florida # 05-8820 # 47673 # TRUE # MS. BONNER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well strangely enough in this case I was looking at statistics as to the average length of time that a case was pending before, between conviction and the filing of the 2254, and Mr. Lawrence's petition was filed within days of what the average was before the AEDPA. That comes up in a statistical analysis I believe by the Department of Justice cited to by the state.

When they joined together in anti-terrorism, effective -- the -- just the word effective was plenty to convey to us what they actually mean. The other big problem that's not been addressed is these people in a practical sense do not have the same lawyer for both proceedings. Many people who were more than willing to practice in state court are not willing to practice in Federal court. It's a more formalized, rigorous endeavor. And in this case what happened was Mr. Lawrence had a lawyer who practiced in the state and obviously must have prepared for him that initial place holder, if you want to call it, 2254, because it's typewritten. They cite to a Westlaw site. I don't think there is any way that anyone can contemplate that that would be Mr. Lawrence's doing in his own right. Also, whether it's 90 days or six months as Your Honor has said, it's always in the control of this Court. Once the 90 -- this is not a frolic of unnumbered years. When someone files a petition he either files it by the time 90 days is over or he is out of court, or he files it and this Court is quickly reviewing it after some input from the other side.

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47170 # FALSE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER #  # We'll hear argument first this morning in Hill v. McDonough. Mr. Doss.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47172 # FALSE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Nelson v. Campbell, this Court held that a challenge to procedures to execute an inmate may be brought in a section 1983 action unless the challenge would necessarily prevent the State from carrying out its execution. Mr. Hill does not challenge the State's right to execute him by lethal injection, but instead, only challenges the particular protocol Florida Department of Corrections in their discretion has adopted. Mr. Hill's claim, thus, does not necessarily prevent his execution, and his claim falls squarely within the scope of Nelson, as announced by this Court. The current claim -- the only focus of that claim is the discretionary choice of the particular injection procedure that has been chosen by the Florida Department of Corrections. Therefore, it does not violate Nelson because the relief sought would not necessarily prevent the State of Florida from carrying out its execution. The State could still carry out the execution through a more humane means by altering the particular protocol that -- that they have adopted.

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47176 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there -- in -- in answer to your question, there's never been a -- a requirement that a section 1983 plaintiff must plead a constitutionally acceptable alternative.

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47179 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You -- we -- we say this -- this procedure is no good. The State comes up with another procedure, and you challenge that one. Right? And -- and another few years go by.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47180 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I respectfully disagree with the fact that it would just leave open a total series of challenges.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47181 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47182 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The State -- the State would have the opportunity to come in and propose a acceptable alternative. Just like any other finding of unconstitutionality, once they propose that alternative, we can challenge that if something is -- is not acceptable, or accept the -- the proposed alternative and the court enters a -- a consent decree.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47183 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You -- you think that the -- the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial court finds that this is no good, and -- and then the trial court proposes an alternative, or -- or invites the State to propose to the trial court an alternative, and then asks whether you agree to that alternative. And if you don't, the trial court makes the decision whether the alternative is -- is constitutional or not.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47184 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This -- that's --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47185 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's not bad.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47186 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- that's entirely correct, and I think we've seen that in -- in a couple of the cases that are out there. Mr. Brown's case out of North Carolina followed that track. Mr. Morales' case somewhat followed that track, although through no fault of Mr. Morales, California wasn't able to carry through on the alternative that they chose because the anesthesiologists decided to not participate. But it -- but it just proceeded to basically an up or down ruling upon the proposed alternatives. So I -- I would disagree that there's a seriatim effect of -- of just perpetual litigation over whether the alternatives --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47187 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You're envisioning that one case will take care of it. That is, if the Court rules against you, that's the end of it. You can't come back with another inadequacy because you'd be barred by claim preclusion. On the other hand, if the State comes up with an acceptable alternative, you agree to it. That's one thing. The Court holds -- but there wouldn't be a second episode I think. One way or another this proceeding would end it.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47188 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The only -- the only way I would foresee a second episode is if they -- if they proposed a second unconstitutional procedure.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47189 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, that probably will be what will be alleged. Of course, you don't know when -- at this proceeding, we have no idea, if we rule in your favor, what alternative the State is going to provide, and I am willing to bet whatever that alternative is that it will be subject to a challenge under a new 1983 suit. There would be no claim preclusion if you didn't know what the alternative was at this point. Right?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47190 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct, although it would proceed to basically an up or down ruling, just as it did in -- in the Brown case and the -- the Morales case.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47191 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # In this very case, you're saying the court would -- would rule on the State's proposed alternative. Right?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47192 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47193 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But if you disagreed with that, you could appeal it up again. Right? You can go to the court of appeals --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47194 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47195 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- and then seek cert up here. Right?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47196 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That -- that would be correct.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47197 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # May -- just as a -- maybe this is technical, but what did you ask for for relief? Did you ask for relief that the State be enjoined from using this method, or that the State be enjoined from executing him until an acceptable method had been found? Because in the first case, the door theoretically is open to seriatim 1983 actions, and in the second case, presumably the issue would be resolved in this one case, as you suggest. So which did you ask for? Injunction against this or injunction until an acceptable alternative came up?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47198 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We asked for -- for two -- two injunctions: one a preliminary injunction allowing the -- the Court to be able to consider the case, and then the way the prayer for relief was worded is, is that we asked for a permanent injunction barring the State of Florida from executing Mr. Hill as they currently intend.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47199 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, if that's -- if that's the relief you get, then the door would be open to successive different 1983 actions every time the State comes up with -- with a new protocol. Whereas, if what the -- if -- if the trial court -- if you succeed at this stage, if we say, yes, you're -- you're properly in court and you go ahead and litigate it, if the trial court, in fact, awards not the injunction that you asked for but the injunction saying do not execute this person until a constitutional protocol has been proposed and accepted by the court, then everything will get resolved in this one action, as you suggest. So would -- would you consent to -- as it were, to an amendment of your prayer for relief so that the injunction will be in such a form that everything can get resolved in this one case?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47200 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In -- in the sense of -- of the State of Florida proposing a -- a -- hopefully a constitutional way of executing --

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47210 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Based upon the litigation that we've seen around the country, yes, I think there are acceptable ways to -- to do it out there. Whether they would choose that way or not, I don't know because the way Florida's system is designed is -- is that it's not statutorily mandated as to -- as to particular protocol that's utilized. It's left totally with the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections. It's not subject to any rulemaking or any administrative procedures as far as promulgating those rules. It's -- it's just within the Secretary's discretion.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47211 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Do you --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47212 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, one -- one of the circumstances that -- that was raised by the questioning is this. States generally have the defense of laches. They -- they require the petition to be filed within a reasonable time. With changes in pharmacology, the laches defense will not usually be available. And under the proposal that the -- the State resolves it once and for all, I suppose the State couldn't adopt a new protocol that it thought was better, more humane, without risking more litigation. So it -- it really is a disincentive for the States to try to make the procedure less painful for the -- for the accused.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47213 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, within -- within the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence of -- of the evolution of -- of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, we've seen hanging go by the wayside. We've effectively seen electrocution go by the wayside. As we advance as a society and as we advance within our knowledge of what's going on --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47214 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Precisely. And that's going to be true with every new protocol.

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47216 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You said there were other States. You mentioned California. There was a proposal by the State. It couldn't be executed. What was the experience -- you mentioned a couple of other cases where the particular combination of drugs was successfully challenged, but then the State did what?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47217 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In Mr. Brown's case in North Carolina, my understanding was -- is that the State had went and purchased a device to make sure that he was actually unconscious during the procedure and wasn't subject to the excruciating pain that's been detailed within -- within the briefs. That actually was challenged because Mr. Brown's attorneys didn't think that the -- the people that were monitoring the machine were properly trained. The court ruled against them, and as we know, Mr. Brown was -- was executed. It didn't result in the series of challenges as -- as many are obviously concerned about.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47218 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Do you agree that that was not a -- that method of execution is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47221 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I don't know enough about -- about that machine to -- to accurately comment on -- on that. I know that the challenges that were brought in Brown wasn't necessarily regarding the machine itself, but it was the qualifications of -- of the people monitoring the machine and whether they had the authority and ability to intervene in the execution itself. And I believe that that was the challenge that was ruled upon by the court in Mr. Brown's case before he was executed.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47222 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Do you know of any method that has been used -- used throughout the country that is not a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47223 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # As far as -- as far as this particular protocol, this particular protocol that's -- that's utilized and that we're -- we're challenging is unconstitutional because of the excruciating pain. If the -- if the sedative works, and there's no -- and -- and the person is not in -- not in wanton and gratuitous type of -- of pain, as -- as this Court's precedents hold, that would be constitutional. It's the -- it's the evidence that's coming forward that this is not what's happening that gives rise to our claim that -- that we would like to be able to litigate in a 1983 action so that we can get those facts before the court.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47224 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is it only excruciating pain that the Eighth Amendment prohibits or is it any pain? Does the Eighth Amendment require painless execution?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47225 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, absolutely not. It's -- it's that it's -- it's that it's wanton and -- and gratuitous pain.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47226 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, when you say wanton and gratuitous, you're -- you're saying any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated. Otherwise, it's gratuitous I assume.

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47228 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes. So if there's any way of -- of execution that is totally painless, that -- that must be pursued.

I mean, gee, you know, that -- that was certainly never the principle evident in -- in executions in the past. Hanging was -- was not a -- you know, a quick and easy way to go. You would have thought they would have required a firing squad instead or something like that. I -- I just don't know where you're deriving this principle that there cannot be any pain associated with the execution.

But what -- what alternative would be acceptable to you? Only one -- only one that -- that, to the maximum extent possible, eliminates all pain. Isn't that right?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47235 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, when you look at the -- when you look at -- at Morales and Brown, both of those that -- that were proposed were eliminating -- for instance, one of the options within Mr. Morales' case was that only the sodium thiopental be used eliminating the pancuronium bromide and the potassium chloride. The State of California, for -- for whatever reason, did not -- did not choose that and went, instead, and tried to use the same protocol and bringing in anesthesiologists that were properly trained and qualified to determine whether or not Mr. Morales was, in fact, anesthetized to -- to a degree where he would not feel that pain. That -- that is -- that is an example of a proper procedure being -- being come up with -- or being dealt with. As well, Mr. Brown -- and -- and thing is, is that for -- there's -- there's never been a requirement for -- for us to plead this. The reason being is -- is this Court's case law within -- for example, Lewis v. Casey shows the -- the strong deference that this Court gives to States in -- in coming up with the prison procedures. That's not an execution case, but here the Florida courts -- not Florida courts, but the Florida officials within the Department of Correction -- they know their facilities. They know what's capable of -- of being done there or not.

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47237 # TRUE # MR.

It was -- what they relied upon was what was -- what was detailed in Sims, which was 6 years ago. But with the -- with the discretion that Florida Department of Corrections has and that they've exhibited in the past, that they've utilized that discretion whenever we were having the electric chair litigation going on, we can't presume that. The added problem is --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47242 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So you have to wait to -- you have to wait to the eve of execution before -- before you think you have a -- a ripe claim under -- under habeas.

Why did you wait until so late?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47247 # TRUE # MR.

It's geared specifically to death-sentenced individuals as opposed to being -- we don't have available what's under Florida statute. Chapter 119 is not available to a death-sentenced inmate. So we must proceed through the 3.852 procedures, and that was not activated until the point in time that the warrant was actually signed.

Because of the way Florida operates with the total discretion and -- and the refusal to give any public records regarding this, yes, we are in the dark regarding it. They could -- they could alleviate that situation by doing an administrative rulemaking process, that that rule is then in place, and with that rule in place, it would be ripe at that point because at that point they're constrained to follow the rule as opposed to having the liberty to -- to change the procedures as they -- as they deem fit at the last minute.

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47285 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That is -- that is correct, and it was recharacterized as -- as a successive habeas petition rather than a 1983 action.

I mean, you -- we don't know what's going to happen if we find out -- if we agree with what your argument in this Court is. Is that right?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47287 # TRUE # MR. DOSS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It would go back for -- for an analysis as to the equities of the situation, and -- and that being an intensely fact-bound procedure, the district court is actually in -- in a better position to go ahead and -- and be able to make that analysis there at the district court level, a Gomez analysis as to the equities that are involved within the situation. So as -- as we sit here today, there has not been any ruling on the merits of -- of this, and there hasn't been any evidence produced in -- in any court through testimony whatsoever regarding the issues of the protocol and -- and things of -- of that nature that we've been discussing here this morning. And I think that -- that whenever -- whenever you -- you look at -- actually if the Court doesn't have any more questions, I'm going to reserve the balance of my time.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47288 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Thank you, counsel. Ms. Snurkowski, we'll hear now from you.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47290 # FALSE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State is here today to suggest that the method that -- to challenge these claims is by habeas corpus, and that the Federal district court, as well as the Eleventh Circuit, was correct in finding that the district court had correctly found it had no jurisdiction because, in fact, it was a functional equivalent of the habeas corpus. But to -- to address some of the issues that were currently brought before the Court today with regard to the ability of the defendant to come forward and discern what exactly was the method by which Florida was intending to execute him, the record bears out that, in fact, the Sims case was in the public domain and, in fact, is the method by which Florida does execute individuals. There was --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47291 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But there's no statute and there's no regulation that requires Florida to do that.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47292 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # These -- there is no specific statute. The statute itself merely says that lethal injection is the method by which Florida is to execute individuals. The Department of Corrections, through rulemaking process internally, provides protocols for the execution day and other protocols with regard to the execution team performing its function on that given day and -- and hours leading up to that. And that has not been changed nor modified, nor has it been challenged --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47293 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But there is no statute, no regulation. That means the executive can do what it will. There's nothing that binds them to the way it was done in Sims' case.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47294 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is correct, to the extent that there's no statutory provision or regulatory rule because, in fact, under Florida -- the Florida legislature has exempted rulemaking of the Department of Corrections with regard to executions.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47295 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And I suppose that's -- that's the complaint. If there was a procedure in place, we could address it. If Florida reserves to itself the ability to change at any time, well, that's -- we want to be told what it will be in our particular case so we have a target that we can aim at.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47296 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And I understand that, but the State would contend that based on the fact that there have 16 executions since the time that Sims has occurred and all those executions have been performed exactly as the manner in which Sims has occurred, and that there has not been any challenge to a deviance from that, and in fact, the Florida Supreme Court has ratified again in this case, when Mr. Hill brought his Eighth Amendment claim, that Sims was the method of execution in Florida, I think we have a very reasoned determination that, in fact, the method of execution, as it has been proposed in Sims, is currently the method of execution that we utilize.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47297 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But what he -- I -- I take it the ripeness issue is -- he delayed in bringing it because he wasn't certain what you'd do. And -- and one of the reasons, I think, would be that it's only recently there was an article in the Lancet --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47298 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47299 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- that says the -- in the opinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant number of executed people are conscious when they die, and that's painful. And then it's been suggested there are ways around that. Just give them more sodium pentothal or have a doctor or somebody there to make certain the individual is unconscious at the time that the death-causing drugs take effect. All right. Now, that doesn't seem too difficult. Maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem too difficult. So why can't they think, you know, Florida -- they can read there too. They have people who read these articles, and indeed, maybe they'll just do it. They don't have any real interest in -- in causing suffering. Why don't they just do it? And so he thinks, up until the last minute, that maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold, when the death warrant is actually executed, it now begins to appear that they won't. And therefore, at that time, he brings the case. Now, I've spun out a story which seems probable, but if it's true, it would be very understandable why this wasn't ripe before the execution warrant is issued and thereafter it is. Now, what is your reply on the ripeness question?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47300 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, my reply on the ripeness question is, first of all, that I don't believe that your scenario -- while I'll accept your scenario as your scenario, it is not accurate with regard to what occurred in Florida. But apart from that, there has not been a change and nor has there been any allegations by the defendant. He certainly, as you have indicated, could have read and, in fact, did read the Lancet article and made no statements with regard to his allegations --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47301 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- my -- my little story was inaccurate as to Florida or accurate as to Florida.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47302 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I'm sorry?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47303 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Is the kind of thing I was explaining why it would be ripe I think -- is that accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what happened in Florida?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47304 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. And my answer, I would suggest to you, is no --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47305 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47306 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- because I think it's part of the pleadings. I mean, he certainly had the wherewithal. If he felt that there was another manner by which it could have been changed or that the Department of Corrections, in this particular instance, was suddenly going to -- now aware of the Lancet article, would change its method, he has not made any allegations of that, nor has he asked. And that was one of the questions that was postulated to him, the fact that in -- that he never asked.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47307 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Would he have to come up --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47308 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Excuse me.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47309 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- with, as you suggest, an alternative that would be acceptable? Suppose there had been a hearing and it was proved more probable than not that in some cases -- not in all, but in some cases -- use of this injection would cause excruciating pain. Would the Petitioner who is objecting being exposed to that have to come up with an alternative in order to avoid the risk of excruciating pain?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47310 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it seems to me, based on this Court's decision in Nelson, that that was the focal point of why relief was granted in the fashion it was, that it was a proper issue to rely in 1983 because, in fact, there might be a -- he had proposed a mechanism that might be alternative mechanism that was accepted by the government. In this instance, it's -- the record is silent and -- which goes --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47311 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, my question to you is -- I take it you're answering yes, that if they prove that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, that's not good enough unless the Petitioner proposes an alternative, that it's all right for the State to expose someone to the risk of what has -- what has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain as long as the Petitioner himself doesn't come up with an alternative.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47312 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think the answer is twofold. First of all, the fact that the articles out there reflect that there's a potential that that could happen, there's not been evidence that it has occurred or has happened, which has been necessarily what is the precursor to when there has been changes in the method of execution because there has been a history where, in fact, a botched execution has occurred no matter what the method may have been. The second part is that there has not be a -- a specific showing in this particular case, nor an allegation for that matter, that any kind of event in this particular case would, in fact, cause excruciating or any kind of pain --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47313 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, because there's been no hearing. We've never gotten past is this -- can you open the door through 1983, and I -- I still don't understand what your answer is to my question. Now, I'm supposing that we do have the 1983 hearing, and the judge says, yes, I agree with the Petitioner's experts. In some cases there will be excruciating pain. Then you say, but, Judge, they haven't come up with an alternative.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47314 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47315 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And the judge says, you're both right. Some people have excruciating pain, but there's been no alternative suggested. Bottom line of that particular case would be?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47316 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That, in fact, I think that he has to make some colorable showing of an alternative that would be acceptable to him based on the procedures because, again, the second prong of that seems to me --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47317 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So the answer is yes.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47318 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47319 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The court, having found that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, still no Eighth Amendment violation because the Petitioner hasn't come up with an alternative.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47320 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47321 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # What is the source of his obligation to do this? I mean, why does he have an obligation under the Eighth Amendment or under any other ground to tell the State how to execute people?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47322 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think the Court in its Nelson opinion suggested that that was a means --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47323 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That -- that was a fact in Nelson, but my question to you is if -- if we were to agree with you and say that that, in fact, is a -- is an element of a 1983 action here, what would be the source of -- of the -- the conclusion that -- that he has to propose a less painful alternative?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47324 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I guess part of the source would be the fact that in overcoming the qualifications -- while maybe his pleading may be simple, the notion is that he has to overcome those things that may have happened in the past. For example, in this particular instance, whether in fact there's been any violation as to a -- a res judicata, collateral estoppel --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47325 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. But I mean, that's not -- that's not the issue. I'm not asking you about res judicata. I'm saying that if he comes into court and, as Justice Ginsburg suggested in her hypo, his experts demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fact finder that there will, in a certain number of cases, be excruciating pain, and he is at least within the risk of that, your response is we're still -- that is no grounds for enjoining the execution under 1983. We can still execute unless he comes up with a proposal for a less painful way of doing it. And what I want to know is, why does he have such an obligation? Why isn't it enough for him to show that there is a probability that he will suffer excruciating pain?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47326 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think for one point, it would be that, in fact, if the State had chosen or selected a method or a change in the modification of the method that was not acceptable to him, then we'd be still back at square zero --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47327 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg can protect their own questions. Part of that allegation in here is that the State wasn't forthcoming with the -- with -- with the information requested, and you're not very forthcoming with the answers. What is the source, what is the legal source, what is the precedent for the proposition that the -- that the condemned man has to come up with an alternative? What case do you cite? What principle do you cite?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47328 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The principle I'm --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47329 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That's what we're asking.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47330 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor. And I'm sorry that I was in any way disingenuous. But the bottom line is I think that Nelson is the bottom line source of -- of concern that we would bring forth to this Court that if, in fact --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47331 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But it was mentioned -- it was mentioned in Nelson. But what would be the reason for -- for elevating that -- that fact in Nelson to a requirement? What is the legal principle that would support your argument?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47332 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think the legal principle being that the individual who is coming forth and seeking to have the execution or requesting some relief -- he has to come forward with some evidence, some -- some body of law --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47333 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But isn't there evidence in -- I noticed the brief filed by some veterinarians call our attention to the statute that prohibits the euthanasia of dogs and cats unless they follow a certain procedure. So there must have been a legislative feeling that unless that procedure were followed, there's a risk of undue pain to the dogs and cats. Why isn't there a similar basis for believing that if you don't follow a similar procedure that such a risk might be present for human beings?

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47336 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That, in fact, recent -- recent development -- and I mean, we're talking about an area that has not -- we have not gotten that far. We don't have a record.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47337 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But your procedure, if I understand it, would be prohibited to be applied to dogs or cats.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47338 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But the procedure -- that procedure -- there is -- there is legal information or -- or scientific information out there that -- or -- refutes that, and that, in fact, there's a different mechanism and that's --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47339 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, at least it was sufficiently convincing to get the Florida legislature to pass a statute.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47340 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's -- that's correct, with regard to that particular aspect because it was one needle being used and all the drugs were being used in that needle. But that is, again --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47341 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Counsel, I would have thought your -- your answer to the line of questioning earlier was that the reason that the Petitioner has to come up with this -- an alternative is that otherwise it's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution itself rather than the particular method. And that if it's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be brought under habeas. If it's just a challenge to the method, it can be brought under 1983. If he's unwilling to say there is a valid method, then it starts to look like a challenge to the execution that has to be brought under habeas.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47342 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And -- and that is the core position the State has taken, and I'm sorry if I did not articulate that in a fashion that --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47343 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But in respect to that core position, I can understand the State's concern with the possibility of abuse. But in Nelson, what the Court says is it points to Gomez, and Gomez was a 1983 case. And there, the Court denied a stay of the execution because it looked into the history of the litigation, and they said that this particular individual had done just what worries you, though in a somewhat different context. He kept bringing the cases, and every time, you know, he'd lose. Then he'd think of another way of making the same point, and in your context, it would be first he challenges this method and he says there are others that are fine. So we go to another. Then he challenges that. Then he challenges that. Then he challenges that, always at the very last minute. So there's a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that you worry about occurs. So why do we need something else like an absolute rule of some sort that the Petitioner has to think of a method of execution, a matter on which he is not necessarily expert, that would turn out in the future to be not painful? I mean, you don't need to put on your overcoat and also turn up the heat.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47344 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47345 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You've got the case that helps you if that occurs. Why do you need to argue for something else?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47346 # TRUE # MS. SNURKOWSKI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, and the only reason we're arguing for something else, it seems to me that the basis upon which we are here today is to determine whether 1983 or habeas will lie. And apart from that, I'm trying to make an argument, to the extent I have or not, that -- that this is more in keeping with habeas as opposed to 1983 litigation. Thank you.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47347 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shanmugam, we'll hear now from you.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47349 # FALSE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Where a prisoner challenges a particular method of execution but fails to identify a permissible alternative, that claim is functionally equivalent to a claim challenging the prisoner's death sentence per se and therefore must be brought --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47350 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why is that? Why is that? That -- that -- in which case it would be like -- like Heck. Right? It would come within the Heck principles.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47351 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, our view is that the Heck principle is not applicable here where a prisoner is seeking relief that is indisputably available in habeas. Our view is that the governing precedent and really the touchstone here is this Court's decision in Preiser v. Rodriguez, which drew the distinction that the Court has long recognized between claims challenging the conditions of a prisoner's confinement and claims challenging the fact or duration of that confinement. Now, to be sure, that analogy is not exactly apt in the capital context. But we believe that where a prisoner identifies a permissible alternative, it is that which renders the claim --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47352 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well -- well, why? But I mean, suppose he doesn't. Okay? But it's absolutely clear he's not saying all methods are unconstitutional. He's saying this method is unconstitutional. If he says this method of constitutional and he wins, then his challenge will not necessarily prevent the State from carrying out its execution. And, of course, I'm reading to you directly from Nelson v. Campbell. That would seem right in point. And why isn't that the end of this case?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47353 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, we do believe that where a prisoner brings an open-ended claim of the type at issue here, it would necessarily prevent the State from carrying out the execution in one relevant sense. Namely, it would prevent the State from carrying out the execution --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47354 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, and if I bring a claim that my prison cell is so cold, I actually get pneumonia and die, or near it, and then I challenge the coldness of the cell, I'm preventing my confinement in one particular way.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47355 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, that's exactly --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47356 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It's a cold cell. And so that would similarly, on your theory, be habeas, but we know it isn't.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47357 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, no, I don't think that that's true, and I do think that the --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47358 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # My cold cell is habeas?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47359 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. I think that the cold cell case clearly is a conditions of confinement claim. And let me explain to you, Justice Breyer, if I may, the reason that the identification of an alternative is so critical. It is the identification of an alternative that renders the claim the functional equivalent of a conditions of confinement claim because a conditions of confinement claim is really necessarily predicated on the assumption that the prisoner will continue to serve exactly the same sentence, even if the claim is successful. In your hypothetical, if a prisoner claims that his cell is too cold, the necessary implication is that the prisoner will be able to continue to be imprisoned at some higher temperature, even if the prisoner does not specify in his complaint that he wants to be held at 70 degrees or 72 degrees. And that is the reason why the identification of the alternative is so important.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47360 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why more than in Nelson?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47361 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in Nelson, it was important, and we would submit that it was really the dispositive factor in the Court's analysis. The Court noted the fact that the State had conceded -- the prisoner had identified and the State had conceded that an alternative method could be used to administer the execution.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47362 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I didn't -- I didn't get your explanation. Had you finished it?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47363 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. (Laughter.)
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47364 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Let me try -- let me -- let me try again through a different route, though. Where a prisoner fails to identify an alternative, the risk here is that such a claim could delay and may, in fact, prevent the ultimate execution of the death sentence.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47365 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # What about the risks that the prisoner will die an excruciating death? I'm asking you the same question that I asked co-counsel. What happens then? He hasn't been able to come up with an alternative, but the judge finds it credible that he may be exposed to an excruciating death. What then?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47366 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in that case, he may very well have a valid Eighth Amendment claim. But our principal submission --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47367 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But would --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47368 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- is that he cannot proceed in a section 1983 action. Presumably what would happen --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47369 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why not? Because he's saying I am not asking for this to be one day further along. I'm just asking the State to give me a death that will not require me to suffer excruciating pain.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47370 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, again, the concern with the claim that fails to identify a permissible alternative is the risk of seriatim litigation. And I think that the history not only of the Nelson case, but also of some of the ongoing litigation, most notably the Morales case in California, demonstrates that that risk is a very real one. Where a prisoner fails to identify an alternative method, it is not --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47371 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Except -- let me just interrupt. Supposing he did identify, say you can only use pentobarbital on me, the same way they do it for a veterinarian. And the -- and the judge says, well, I don't think that's required. But he would then be satisfied the 1983 requirement?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47372 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the State would at least have the option in that case --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47373 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Of saying no.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47374 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- of acquiescing in the alternative. The State would, of course, have the option of saying no and litigating it.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47375 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But do you agree if he had said I propose alternative X, even though it's highly unlikely the State will accept it, that would make it a 1983 action?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47376 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That would make it a 1983 action. And the critical point, as this Court recognized --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47377 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Even though there's no functional difference in terms of future litigation between that case and this.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47378 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the only reason that there would be no functional difference is if the State chose to, in fact, litigate the issue, notwithstanding his identification of the permissible alternative. And in Nelson --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47379 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So you're saying -- saying then that the defense bar, the capital punishment bar, and the prisoners are the group of people that have to go and do the research on humane methods of putting people to death rather than the government.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47380 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I --

argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47382 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- I would -- I would respectfully submit, Justice Breyer, that that is exactly the kind of research that they would have to do in order to bring the claim in the first place.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47383 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47384 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I don't think -- I don't think that's the research they would do. I think the research they would do would be to come up with another method that the State certainly would not find acceptable, thereupon, rendering it a 1983 action and -- and leaving everything in the same status that it's -- that it is here. I mean, I don't see that you've accomplished anything by simply demanding that they -- that they come up with an alternative. They're going to come up with a -- with an unacceptable alternative.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47385 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the alternative at a minimum has to be --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47386 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It -- it might be malpractice not to come up with -- with an unacceptable alternative. (Laughter.)
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47387 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # At a minimum, the alternative has to be one that is permissible under currently governing law.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47388 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Old age. They'll come with that alternative, old age. Right? (Laughter.)
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47389 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, that would not -- presumably that would not be a method of execution at all.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47390 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # This -- this is a death case. It was not that amusing. Let me ask you this. Doesn't the State have some minimal obligation under the Eighth Amendment to do the necessary research to assure that this is the most humane method possible? Doesn't the State have a minimal obligation on its own to do that?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47391 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I'm not sure whether it -- it would have an obligation to use the most humane method under the Eighth Amendment because this Court's cases have only suggested that the gratuitous infliction of pain is barred by the Eighth Amendment. I'm not aware of any cases --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47392 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I can define gratuitous -- I don't have the dictionary here. But gratuitous means essentially unnecessary. If there were other -- other means, other alternatives, that might be used, it seems to me that the State might have some minimal obligation to investigate those.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47393 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think more broadly, Justice Kennedy, that one reason that States do have discretion in this area -- and I think that Florida is not unusual in that regard -- is that prison officials are expected to adopt to evolving methods of execution and to take into account changes that might suggest that a particular method is problematic. And so whether or not there is a constitutional obligation, I think that there is every reason to think that States will, in fact, do that. I think that it is noteworthy --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47394 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But is there -- is there in this case? I mean, the Lancet article has been out there for a while, and it certainly is enough to suggest, in your words, that there is something problematic about the manner in which Florida proposes to do this. And yet, we have not heard a word that Florida has made any effort whatsoever to find an alternative or, for that matter, to -- to disprove what the Lancet article suggests. And so it's one thing for you to say the States have discretion. I don't think that answers Justice Kennedy's question as to why the State does not have an obligation to fulfill its constitutional duty to execute without gratuitous pain. And I don't see why you have given any answer to -- to the proposal that that obligation requires the State to do some investigation of it's own.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47395 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, whether or not the State has that obligation -- it may very well have that obligation as a constitutional matter, but putting that to one side, it does seem as if the critical question is whether or not the State, in fact, has adopted a method that inflicts cruel and unusual punishment, and where a prisoner has a claim of that variety, a prisoner has other options if the prisoner is unwilling to identify a permissible alternative to bring that claim besides --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47396 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # We've -- we've never held that anyway, have we?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47397 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And the Court has never held that.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47398 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That the State must, in -- in imposing the death penalty, use a method that inflicts the least amount of pain.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47399 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The Court has not held that. Instead, it has --
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47400 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And presumably there's some range between most humane and what's cruel and unusual. Right?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47401 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think that that is presumably true, based on the formulations that this Court has used which have repeatedly focused on the gratuitous or wanton infliction of pain as opposed to the least painful method.
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47402 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Shanmugam, several of the emergency death proceedings we've had involving this question, the district court judges have assumed that it could proceed under 1983 but then denied relief because it was brought on the eve of execution, as this one was. Is that option available to the district court in this case if it's sent back?
argument in Hill v. McDonough # 05-8794 # 47403 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It is available to the district court, and indeed, it would potentially be available even to this Court as a matter of first instance as it was in the Gomez case. Thank you.

The interesting thing is, is that -- is that Florida created this problem. They can -- they can lay it out as to how to euthanize dogs and cats, but they can't do it for humans. That's perfectly in the open. Yet, they shroud this in secrecy. We can't get public records.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46926 # FALSE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. In 1988, the Government of British Columbia created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated by development of the Province's natural resources pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States. The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal court. Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ status. First, the court articulated the wrong test for determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign State. The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public functions that are the best indication of its sovereign status. The British Columbia Government receives and distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations, supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to provincial laws not applicable to private companies and grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from taxation.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46934 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Sorry. That removal was proper under the sovereign removal provisions of 1441(d) and 1442(a). It also then said it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46935 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But at the point it was acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was not that it thought the removal had been proper; the basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46936 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But immunity was the basis of the district court's thinking that it had to remand.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46942 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, the Thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four times by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory amendments.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46943 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But stare decisis on the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the statute's been changed.

FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, the Thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the Osborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead -- from the time it was decided even through statutory amendments. Our submission is that if Congress intended to change that rule, it could have done so clearly. And we note that the Respondents here don't ask for Thermtron to be overruled, and it is clear from the amicus on their side, that the only way you could rule in favor of the Respondents in this case would be to overrule Thermtron.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46945 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But Thermtron was such a far cry from this case.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46946 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But here, Justice Ginsburg, the court did have jurisdiction because removal was properly effectuated once the entities that we moved were identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign sovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal sovereigns in the case of BPA.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46947 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But we go into that question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46948 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, you're not, Justice Scalia, and here's why. Immunity is not a ground for remand because it is not a precondition for a removal by a sovereign. It is a separate freestanding issue. It is a status determination that determines whether removal is proper by those sovereigns.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46949 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That would be fine if 1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it says.

My point is that the label the district court attached here was the wrong label, and that's why the court of appeals to satisfy --
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46953 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why? Why was it wrong when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district court said I have -- these people are totally immune from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46954 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because it is inconsistent with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive effect to remand a case on the ground that the sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate their immune status in State court. That is precisely why Congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46955 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Then what you are really arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with foreign sovereign immunities.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46956 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's our backup submission, Justice Souter. You do not need to reach that if you agree with our principal submission and --
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46957 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But the trouble with the principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have said that even if the district court has come to an erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling, that is not appealable.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46958 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But Justice Souter, it did so. The case -- the cases in which the Court has said so have always been grounds -- jurisdictional grounds cognizable under 1447(c). Immunity from suit is not such a ground, because the purpose of having the removal provision on the basis of status is to allow the Federal courts to decide the immunity status. If the court sends the case back to State court on immunity grounds, it does not have preclusive effect in the State courts. The State courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign immunity status and there will be no recourse except through appeal through the State court --

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46962 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Justice Scalia, that's not our backup argument. Our point is that in this case, the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of the successful removals, which everybody conceded were correct, that the label that it attached, immunity is subject matter jurisdiction, is not a label for a ground recognized in 1447(c). So it was appropriate for the court of appeals to exercise appellate jurisdiction to determine whether or not the remand was a mandatory remand under 1447(c) or a discretionary one of the type this Court has recognized in the Cohill case.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46963 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Did you request -- when the question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was before the district court, did you request that the district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the case -- the question up on appeal?
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46964 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't believe that we did, Justice Ginsburg. This case was remanded. A motion -- motions for clarification were subsequently brought. But a 1292(b) order was not requested by Powerex.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46965 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Because that would have taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay the remand to allow this question of law to be determined by the court of appeals.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46966 # TRUE # MR. FREDERICK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It is certainly the case that in searching through the docket entries, you'll discover that there was a holding by the district court of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure. But the point that is important here is that even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity claims upon the part of the Federal and foreign sovereigns. And it is their theory that the district court never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in Federal court.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 46967 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # They don't care whether it had subject matter jurisdiction or not.

I mean, the whole issue on the merits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not. And you can't assume that you're correct when the remand provision or the provision barring appeal when it's been remanded doesn't care whether you're correct. The idea is, you can get a correct determination in State court through up to review by this Court eventually, as you can in Federal court. There's no reason to assume that the Federal court is the only place you would get a correct determination.

You can make the same argument. There's nothing distinctive here. This statute says that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a right to be tried in Federal court. Fine. But the statute also says that if you're a defendant in a diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal court. And I don't know why this is any more demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary diversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're entitled to trial in federal court.

When a case is removed on diversity grounds, the court of appeals -- the district court is obliged to examine the bases of diversity. That is what the court's removal duty is. When a foreign sovereign removes a case, the district court's duty is to determine is this a foreign State within the meaning of the FSIA. If it is, I have jurisdiction.

Our position, as we explain in a footnote in our reply brief, is that they have a jury trial right as against Duke and Reliant; they do not as against the foreign sovereigns that they have sued. So at root, the case is about the kind of comity and dignity that the courts of the United States will accord to foreign sovereigns. If Powerex were sued on the basis of non-commercial acts, it would not be entitled to have its immunity defense vindicated if the district court is held to have no jurisdiction, notwithstanding the proper removal under 1441(d).

This Court has held that the courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of 1447(c). In fact, just this term in Osborn, the district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c) for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47008 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Osborn made it very clear that was an extraordinary case where Congress had explicitly ordered two conflicting things. One, it said no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no review of remands. So the Court was as clear as it could be that only when you have those conflicting signals does that court -- does that case have any application.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47009 # TRUE # MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor is absolutely correct. Osborn concerned a particular kind of categorical exception from 1447(c). Our argument is that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c). That although the District Court termed the sovereign immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not jurisdictional in the relevant sense. And this Court held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case. There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the district court on the basis of its immunity and the district court certified that holding as a jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this Court. Yet this Court looked beyond that label attached by the district court and held that sovereign immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense because it does not limit the authority of the Federal courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule that would preclude suit in State court as well. Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that the defendant is immune. When Congress authorized sovereign defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate their immunity, it did not intend that when the district court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to State court which would be free to disregard the Federal court's decision.

In other words, you have got subject matter jurisdiction but the statute contemplates it may -- later -- later you may lose subject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there. And I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari materia with (c) so that the remands would not be subject to review. It seems to me the same situation here. You have got allegedly subject matter jurisdiction. It is later defeated, and it is remanded. Why shouldn't that be covered by (c)?
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47017 # TRUE # MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What, what's notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same time that it amended 1447(c). It provided in 1447(e) for an authority to remand in a particular instance where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction post-removal. It had of course been the rule since this Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. And when Congress amended the language in 1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, it at the same time -- and added the language, or changed the language in the second sentence that raises problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to remand based on post-removal events that would have been unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was intended to confer general authority to remand on the basis of post-removal events.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47018 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But you don't have any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered by 1447(d), do you?
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47019 # TRUE # MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. And the courts of appeals that have considered that question likewise hold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari materia with (d) although the courts seem to be split on whether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable decision appealable under Waco or not. But -- but that issue is not presented. But what is significant is that had Congress intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for the first time remand on the basis of post-removal events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet, the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that Congress believed that in the absence of that provision, the Court would have been limited to two alternatives. Authorize the joinder -- or deny the joinder, or dismiss the case.

So the court does not lack removal jurisdiction. The reference in 1447(c), second sentence to "lacks subject matter jurisdiction," refers to lacks removal jurisdiction. And in fact, this Court used that shorthand repeatedly in the Kircher decision to describe 1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction. This Court --

HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the Court has to go back to the history of the statute, how it's evolved.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47044 # FALSE # MR. SIMON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. There are two reasons, independent and sufficient reasons why there is in appellate jurisdiction in this case. The first most narrow and simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of jurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which accept the district court's remand order for what it is and what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under 1447(d). That is a simple direct route to that result. There is a second approach suggested by a lot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors have heard this morning. And I want to lay it out briefly for the Court. And it is that, as the law professor amici have suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the lower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of 1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to 1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of appeal. And the Court could clear out some of this underbrush, mooting many of the issues that Mr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have raised. Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the question Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring opinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron does not say what many of the lower courts think it does. Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it does, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by Carnegie Mellon. The notion that the only proper remand is a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie Mellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand covered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also ancient history. Congress has given us a simple and strong message, which is when we're disputing the forum, when the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith disputing forum, State court versus Federal court, Congress has said take one shot at it, let an Article III judge determine whether the forum is State court or Federal court, and move on to the merits.

SIMON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The district court found that they were immune, properly followed the law, but determined because it believed it had no subject matter jurisdiction that it should then stop at that point, that it should just walk away from the case and remand it, over the vehement disagreement of B.C. Hydro and the parallel vehement disagreement of the Bonneville Power Administration. The Ninth Circuit when it erroneously took the appeal on the remand also clarified or straightened out that issue.

argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47110 # TRUE # MR. SIMON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think there are two differences, so if I could. One is textual and one is important. Let me start with the textual difference. The textual difference is that 1447(d) speaks to remands, and so to the extent the district court remanded the matter to State court the remand is untouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of 1447(d). And if the foreign -- if the foreign relations body, lobby, doesn't like that, if the State Department doesn't like, that they can go to the Capitol and get that fixed quite easily. There are half a dozen exceptions to 1447(d) for class actions, for Native Americans, for civil rights cases, and they can get their own exceptions. So to the extent what the trial court did was remand, it is untouchable. That is my textual answer. It's a remand, i.e. Waco, in which the court says the remand is untouchable, the dismissal of the unnecessary or indispensable party is reviewable. So what I would say is, although the remand is untouchable, the denial of immunity -- and that's why I kept saying collateral order; I apologize if that confused you, Justice Alito. I meant that line of cases about going straight up even though the case was continuing. While the case continues in State court, where it belongs under 1447(d), it would appear under this line of collateral order cases that the denial of immunity per se could go up on its own --

And therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when they -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and the necessity to hire clever lawyers.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47146 # TRUE # MR. SIMON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Congress has said -- Congress has said the contrary. And there are often important differences between State and Federal courts. Justice Breyer, I think you have some experience in California. We have 9 to 3 jury verdicts. You will have a litigant here next year saying that the difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous jury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really important. Now, I would just briefly like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's question about a jury because I don't think she got the full answer. Let me give it to you, Justice Ginsburg. The jury issue is virtually -- I would say not virtually. The jury issue is out of this case based on my adversary's reply brief. I will tell why you. We did ask for a jury trial in our case and we were upset about the whole notion of this case being removed on a cross-claim we were not involved in -- we never sued Powerex -- losing our right to a jury trial on this important case. Mr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote 4, page 3 -- or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize -- that our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct they do exist -- I'm not sure they're unanimous -- Our right to jury trial would survive even though he would have a right to a bench trial under his theory. Well, there is no right to a jury trial on the cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client. The cross claim in the California court, which got this whole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for equitable indemnification and declaratory relief, equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury trial. So I think we are all now in agreement on a jury trial. We are arguing someone else's case. Some day a litigant will appear in this Court and present the issue of jury trial --
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47147 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But they raise that there is still the question of Federal forum over State forum.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47148 # TRUE # MR. SIMON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There is, and that's the issue that I think Congress has clearly and definitively said, the State courts have pretty good judges, pretty good juries, pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to this Court. In Kircher, the Court's opinion says, "the State courts are perfectly competent to resolve these issues." The cost of this case being frozen for 3 or 4 years while we debated these issues -- and these issues are very difficult. I would say, we don't only have a backup position, we have a backup backup position. Because we think, number one, the court should be taken at its word. We think, number two, the court had no subject matter jurisdiction. Removing jurisdiction is not subject matter jurisdiction. If you look at the book, Chapter 89, Section 1441, et cetera, it's titled Removal of Cases From State Courts. You won't find the word "subject matter jurisdiction" in there anywhere. A removal petition removes a case from the State court to the Federal court, where if it's a foreign sovereign immunities case, the Federal court decides if it has subject matter jurisdiction. That's what 1330 says in haec verba. It's what this Court's decision in Verlinden versus Central Bank of Nigeria says in haec verba. Verlinden says every court that gets a foreign sovereign immunities case must determine at the outset whether it has subject matter jurisdiction by determining if the foreign sovereign is immune. Which means that Judge Whaley was correct when he decided that by concluding he had an immune party in front of him, he had no jurisdiction. And it was equally correct for Bonneville, when he determined that United States versus Myers says the same thing, so that he had no subject matter jurisdiction. And in addition, there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine. This notion of "removal jurisdiction" quote unquote, it's a term we all use. The Court used it in Kircher. I use it. Other people use it. But if you start getting serious about your words, it's meaningless in this context. We have subject matter jurisdiction and it is conferred in the area of 1330, 1331, 1332. It is not conferred in 1441, 1442, or 1443. It's simply not there. So my backup argument is, he was right on every point. And my backup argument beyond that is again, please, reread Carnegie Mellon. Put it next to Thermtron and look at what the lower courts have done. They have found excuse after excuse to take appeals in cases that have no business being in the courts of appeals. They don't have immunity issues. They don't have foreign sovereign issues. They don't have anything.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47149 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, the reason why they may have done that is because they've seen case after case where absolute power corrupts absolutely. And because district judges know that remand orders are not reviewable, on occasion they will remand cases for reasons that are clearly improper. That may be the reason. Now on your first argument, you say that what the district judge says is dispositive. You mean if the district judge says I lack subject matter jurisdiction because my docket is crowded, that's not --

Let me say it more clearly. Kircher, decided last term, makes clear the line between what can and can't be done. It discusses precisely this point and it refers to the Ryan versus Contra case and it refers to the Principi case. And it says that when the court is patently wrong about whether the issue it is discussing is subject matter jurisdiction, then this Court may enter into --
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47153 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Counsel, it's a good thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you fall back very quickly. I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or otherwise. And if it's remanded for a silly reason, that will be corrected on review of the State supreme court by this Court.
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47154 # TRUE # MR. SIMON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That would be my first answer, and the Chief Justice said it much better than mine, than I have. But I think, Your Honor, looking at Kircher, to be fair, looking at Kircher, I believe that is the position Justice Scalia took, it is concurring opinion. And I didn't want to suggest that Justice Scalia's concurring opinion was the opinion of the Court. The opinion of the Court wrestles with what I thought was Justice Alito's question. What do you do if the trial judge says he has no subject matter jurisdiction and he has not simply made a garden variety jurisdictional error but he has missed what the issue is? It's really failure to state a claim. It's really something else. And we of course have the Steele case which says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often get confused about them. And the Court answered the question by saying, only when the trial court is patently wrong, patently wrong not about the jurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a jurisdictional question, only when the court is patently wrong do we second guess the court. So --
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47155 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That certainly changes the argument. So the notice of appeal that's filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals has to consider that before determining whether it has jurisdiction to review the remand order.

Because my time is running short, I would say the key point in this case came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in the Ninth Circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing and argument, and it was denied. That was the point at which if a litigant simply parroted the phrase "this is patently wrong," would likely in most circuits before most panels have lost. And this matter would have gone back to the State court 2-1/2 years before it got affirmed by the Ninth Circuit and five years before today.

In footnote 6 of the Government's brief, the Government cites the Lehman case which makes this point clear and argues that the point should be applicable to sovereigns in the context in which we are faced here. The question of whether a foreign entity, and it's more complicated often in the real world, Justice Breyer, as your question's identified not simply with questions but with the kinds of entities that foreign governments create to advance public purposes. The intent of Congress was not to have those kinds of entities tested in State court to determine whether or not they enjoyed the privileges and procedural protections of the FSIA. And it is not simply a question of whether or not an elderly judge might choose to recognize China or Formosa, but rather the kinds of instrumentalities that were created by those governments to advance public purposes, to serve as separate political entities, and who would be performing the kinds of acts that might lead them into litigation, and --
argument in case 05-85, Powerex Corporation versus Reliant Energy Services # 05-85 # 47162 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And Congress said, those entities don't get any immunity, they get two things: They get a federal forum and they get a judge trial.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46702 # FALSE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Clean Air Act requires that the owner of a major emitting facility obtain a prevention of significant deterioration permit before engaging in a modification, which is defined to include any physical change that increases the amount of any pollutant emitted by such source. Since 1980, EPA's PSD regulations have measured such increases in terms of actual emissions in tons per year.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46703 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's a disputed point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the regulations measured PSD emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46704 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but the text of the regulations refers pervasively, and I'm referring to the definition of Official major modification which is in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2) and subsequent paragraphs of that regulation, refers pervasively to actual emissions and measures emissions exclusively in tons per year.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46705 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It is a little of an exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer. In fact, the director of the PSD program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the interpretation that opposing counsel took.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46706 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Justice Scalia. Respondent has relied heavily on two early applicability determinations.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46707 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Rightly so, I think. I mean, it was the earliest, application of the regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in charge of the program.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46708 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Scalia, as we point out in our brief, Director Reich does not adopt Duke's theory, in fact contradicts it. He doesn't say that a new source performance standard modification must precede a PSD major modification. Instead, in both he relies on the express exclusion in the PSD regulations for increases in hours of operation and the production rate, and as EPA explained in its contemporaneous Official preamble, that provision by its terms is an exception from the definition of physical change. It is not a provision that says -- increase is attributable to a physical change, to increased hours that are enabled by physical change, are not considered. The plain language of the regulation actually contradicts this reading. These determinations themselves are quite ambiguous, and of course they are two of dozens of such determinations.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46709 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, whatever the reason he gave, was it -- these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not participate, when that challenge was brought, were these -- were those opinions already out there?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46710 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Those opinions were out there but the plain language of the regulation and the preamble which explain that the increased hours exclusion was simply to allow companies to respond to demand and to link the coverage of PSD to construction activity. What we have here is a physical change in the plants, massive renovations of these elaborate networks of pipes and tubes that compose a central component.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46711 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I understand that, and I think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the PSD regulations. But what I Official am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed. They don't challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor. And then some years later, when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46712 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Scalia, these regulations were challenged early on and there was a -- as the Court is aware, there was a settlement agreement in 1982 to which Duke was, in fact, a party, that proposed to add the hourly rate test that is completely absent from these regulations.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46713 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But could Duke have had a challenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations? Could they have reopened the issue at that point?

DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They did in fact precisely that, Justice Kennedy, and that was resolved in the New York proceeding by the D.C. Circuit.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46718 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # We've wrestled with these things for several days. It's disappointing to hear you tell us they're clear.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46719 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They're clear in this respect, they did not include an hourly rate test. As Judge Posner in the Cinergy opinion this summer said, the argument that the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a challenge to the validity of these 1980 regulations because they don't say it, they don't provide for it, and they are very specific and detailed, and instead turn on actual annual emissions. And the entire rationale EPA offered was linked to that effort to capture real world changes in emissions.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46722 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I know you say he's wrong, but if somebody in his position with his expertise can interpret the regulations in that way, doesn't that show that they're not clear on their face?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46723 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We think that this Court can resolve, can interpret, can address the reasonableness of EPA's construction of the increased hours exclusion. What it can't do is certainly what the Fourth Circuit did, which is to say that the PSD regulations must be the same. They are obviously not the same. They are different in multiple respects. And certainly that challenge could have been raised, and certainly that challenge was barred, and of course the court of appeals expressly called the regulations irrelevant, the texts and interpretations of the regulations. That's exactly what a court is supposed to be doing.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46724 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Right. In deciding whether the regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper for a court to take into account that the regulations must follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD definition be the same as the NSPS -- what is it -- NSPS definition? I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory -- Official or regulatory construction. Cannot a court give great weight to that in interpreting these ambiguous regulations?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46725 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that -- they're not ambiguous as to whether they're identical, and to hold that they have to be is certainly an invalidation. And the D.C. Circuit, of course, held that the statute doesn't require identity as between the two sets of regulations. And we're not here on certiorari from the New York decision, we're here on an enforcement action in which a court leapt over the express limitations imposed on it, declared the language of the regulations irrelevant, and indeed misapplied them rather dramatically.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46726 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I don't think the same argument has necessarily to be made, but the question still before us is how you interpret the regulations. Let's assume that's just a regulatory interpretation question, it's not a statutory question.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46727 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. Right.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46728 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But in deciding that, whatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that we're entitled to take into account the necessity that the regulations comply with the statute. And if they are ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the Official direction that it seems to us would provide consistency with the statute. Now does that violate the jurisdictional bar?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46729 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. I have no problem with any of that. If the regulations are ambiguous, take into account the statutory text, structure, policies. What the court below did, of course, was say it doesn't matter what the regulations say, these have to be the same. It forgot that in fact, these regulations were very different. The D.C. Circuit said there's no statutory mandate of identity and that the -- and, of course, Respondent was there in the D.C. Circuit. It was permitted to assert a challenge to this divergence, as the court called it, between NSPS regulations and PSD. And the court said --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46730 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If the regulations are ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in different ways and can change its interpretation over time. Of course, what your friend argues happened here is that the agency changed its interpretation in the context of an enforcement program. Now accepting that premise, what is the -- what should Duke have done when that interpretation was changed in an enforcement program?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46731 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Accepting that premise, they Official could have sought an applicability determination. Duke knew very well what EPA's interpretation was because of the WEPCO decision. EPA had been -- and subsequent actions. In fact, Duke's attorneys were vociferously charging that EPA changed the rules and was acting ultra vires.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46732 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Donahue, were there earlier enforcement actions in which EPA was taking the position that it took in this action against Duke?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46733 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, in the WEPCO decision -- I mean, EPA has always taken the position that actual annual emissions is the standard under the 1980 rules.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46734 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But were they, in fact, enforcing that standard? So that -- you said that Duke could have asked for a non-applicability ruling, but at the time Duke started up its --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46735 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Certainly. I mean, WEPCO was an applicability determination. That was in 1989-90. Puerto Rican Cement was an applicability determination. Duke instead, knowing that EPA believed that increased utilization that is caused by physical change has to be considered under this, as is prescribed in these very detailed regulations, Duke decided not to do that, to go forward, and it didn't, in fact, come to the State or to EPA. Official Of course, the increased hours -- I understand the Court's concern about the Reich memos. But EPA's construction of the increased hours exception is completely correct under the plain language of the regulations. And in WEPCO the Court upheld. So that there was no question that not only was it consistent with the plain language, but whatever Reich had said, the express language of the regulations was as far as the exception went. There was no further confusion, if those early memos caused confusion. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. Thank you.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46738 # FALSE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals exceeded its jurisdiction and misconstrued the Clean Air Act in holding that EPA was required to define the term "modification" identically for the separate NSPS and PSD programs, and on the jurisdictional point I'd like to address the whipsaw question, because in fact it's quite Official clear that there's no whipsaw issue here for a number of reasons. It's true that there are those ambiguous and cursory 1981 statements from Mr. Reich, who was a subordinate official within EPA. In 1988, the administrator of EPA, the head of the agency, in the WEPCO decision, the applicability determination, made very clear what EPA's position is on the application of the hours of operation exclusion and the fact that this is an annual tons per year test. That's page 44 of the joint appendix. He made that perfectly clear and it has always been clear that that is, in fact, the EPA's official position beginning with the 1980 preamble. But again --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46739 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Should a challenge to that have been brought in the D.C. Circuit at that time, or would you have argued that's too late?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46740 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I'm not sure whether it could have been brought at that time. But the fact of the matter is a challenge was brought on this issue in -- to the 1980 regulations. True, Duke didn't assert it, but General Motors and the steel industry did assert in the 1981 brief they filed in that challenge to the 1980 rule --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46741 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, presumably Duke could say, we looked at the Reich memorandum and we were following that and all of a sudden this new 1988 Official thing came up and they are surprised by that. Now you're saying it's already too late because somebody else challenged it in 1980?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46742 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, they might have that argument, Your Honor, except for the fact that the challenge to the 1980 rules was stayed and was not reopened until 2003. In 2003, Duke and other parties sought to reopen and were granted permission to reopen that challenge to the 1980 rules. They filed a statement of issues in 1984 and a brief in 1984 challenging the regulation on the ground that if EPA's interpretation was correct and that it did not require an increase in maximum total achievable emissions, as the NSPS did, test did, they argued that it was invalid. They raised the very incorporation theory that they advance here, that is the statutory argument that Congress was required to follow for the PSD regulations the same regulatory approach that the NSPS regulations had followed in 1977 with the hourly maximum achievable test. They made that very argument in their brief in the D.C. Circuit in 2004, the D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument on the merits.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46743 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # To be fair to them, that very same argument was more a product of the Fourth Official Circuit than of Duke. They had a somewhat different approach before the Fourth Circuit and then the Fourth Circuit came up with this insistence on the parallel construction.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46744 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. Well, I think it's important to distinguish. There are two statutory arguments here. One is what I would call the incorporation theory. That is the argument that Congress by borrowing the definition, the statutory definition, also necessarily borrowed and mandated adoption of the regulatory definition from the NSPS program. That argument, the incorporation argument, was made by Duke in its brief in 2004 in the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument at pages 17 through 19 of its decision in its 2005 New York decision.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46745 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why was that rejection wrong? Because this issue is still important to me for purposes of statutory construction. Is it conceivable that when Congress says the word widget in this statute has to mean the same as the word widget in the other statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the apparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can adopt regulations under one statute which regulations Official say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations under another statute that says it means something else. I mean, to say that they have to mean the same thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to say they mean the same thing.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46746 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, it is a fundamental principle of administrative law and deference to agency decisionmaking that when Congress adopts an ambiguous statutory phrase and charges the agency with implementing that phrase the agency has discretion, has a delegation of rulemaking authority and policymaking authority to choose from among the various permissible interpretations.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46747 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Of course it does, but when Congress says the definition in the two statutes has to be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46748 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor, because Congress has not mandated, as it could have done, that the choice of the specific interpretation from among the permissible options must be identical across both programs.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46749 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, then it's meaningless to say the definition has to be the same.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46752 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The statutory definition is ambiguous, but within the limits of the ambiguity it imposes constraints on the discretion of the agency. The agency must choose from among the options that are permissible given the range of language that Congress used. But within that range the agency has discretion. Think of it this way, Your Honor. If there were no PSD program, if we were talking only about the NSPS program, Congress gave an ambiguous definition to the agency the agency would have discretion to adopt different tests for determining whether emissions increased for different types of equipment even within that single program, because the statutory definition is ambiguous. The statute therefore does not mandate a one size fits all approach and the agency in its discretion could well determine that one emissions test is appropriate for some types of equipment, another emissions test is appropriate for other types of equipment, as long as both of those tests are within the permissible bounds of the statutory ambiguity. The agency is entitled to do that.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46753 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And the ambiguity is the word "increase," which could mean different things?

The court is simply precluded from considering a challenge that would invalidate the regulation because that is the determination Congress made in requiring pre-enforcement review to avoid the Official problem of inconsistent determinations and circuit conflicts and 700 district judges potentially construing the statute in different ways and tying EPA's hands. The Congress made that determination.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46766 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's quite common. It's quite common, Your Honor, in any regime where review of an agency decision is relegated to the exclusive jurisdiction of one court, as it is here, and enforcement proceedings are brought in a different court. Hobbs Act agencies, their decisions are reviewable in the court of appeals but often enforceable in the district courts. The district court cannot look behind the determination of the agency to challenge its validity because that rests in the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals. Obviously there's a timing issue in this statute as well because of the requirement of pre-enforcement review. Whatever -- whatever concerns might be raised in a situation where a party could not reasonably have been expected to challenge it at the time it was originally promulgated are addressed by the after-arising provision in section 307(b)(1) which permits challenges that could not have been made within Official the 60-day period to be brought later in appropriate circumstances. And in any event, if there were some concerns at the outer limits of a provision like this one, they have nothing to do with this case where Duke's challenge, actual challenge to the agency decision, the 1980 rule, it was heard in 2005. And so Duke had more opportunity than you could possibly ask for to understand exactly what EPA's position was, understand exactly what the regulation meant and to challenge it in the D.C. Circuit. It did so and it can't do it here.

But they could find a petition, they clearly could find a petition for rulemaking with the EPA, saying your regulation is invalid, it's been around for 25 years, but it's still invalid, you need to rescind it, and when the agency declined to do that they could then go to the D.C. Circuit.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46775 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Can I ask you about an argument I think they did make? I think they made this Official argument. On page 26 of your brief, I think it's explained well. You set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is "any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase." Then you have little (iii), which is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which leads to -- is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate. So that's out of it. Now, the question is what's in it? If that's out of it, what's in it? I think what they've said is, if you think about that, we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but just means you can run it more hours. And they say their proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation for years and years and years. Indeed, we did what we did thinking that was it. And then after we did what we did, they pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't it; now it means any physical change, like you change a nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased capacity to emit more. It's just you run it more hours. Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's not what this reg has been about. And they made that argument, according to them, very strongly and the Official Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that it's hard for even them to defend. All right. Now, that's what I think, that's what I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the heart of it. And if it is, what do you say?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46776 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There are several things, Your Honor. First of all the language of the regulation simply does not support that interpretation. What the regulation says is that hours of -- a change in hours of operation is not a physical change. Fine. But we have a physical change here. It is undisputed that Duke made physical changes to its facilities, major modifications, sort of using that term in the non-regulatory sense, but substantial replacements of physical equipment at the facilities. So physical change has occurred. The hours of operation exclusion, therefore, has no longer any relevance because it applies only at the physical change step of the analysis. There has been a physical change here regardless of whether hours of operation changed or not. Therefore, the hours of operation exclusion no longer applies. The next question is whether the -- if the physical change that did occur resulted in a significant net emissions increase. Here it did under the plain Official language of the regulations and under the test that EPA applies. It is true that 1981 they were arguably mistaken to the extent one can discern what the, Mr. Reich was actually saying, they seem to be simply a mistake in interpretation. But in 1988, the administrator of the agency, the head of the agency, made very clear EPA's position, the very same position it is taking here today on the hours of operation exclusion. The First Circuit in the Puerto Rican Cement case, as Your Honor knows, upheld that interpretation in 1989. The Seventh Circuit in footnote 11 in the WEPCO decision upheld that determination in 1990. It was restated by the EPA again and again and it is well established. Thank you, Your Honor.

Because it seems to me it is very clear that the understanding of everyone in the industry, outside the industry, from 1980, candidly well beyond 1988 all the way up until 1999, was that these regulations didn't apply under any circumstances in the absence of an increase in the capacity. And you had to demonstrate that there would be an increase in the hourly rate of the emissions.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46785 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # As I heard Mr. Donahue, he Official was talking about WEPCO. Understand the context of WEPCO. WEPCO was a situation where every one of the changes was a modification within the meaning of NSPS. And then the question is were they also modification -- major modifications within the -- within the meaning of the PSD. And that's what they analyzed. So it didn't say anything about the argument we've been making which is what is a modification. The only statements that I know of that are out there are the two Reich statements which I just quoted to you, says exactly our interpretation. But even more powerful at least in my view is the quotation from the amicus brief from the State of Alabama and the 12 States that relied on the Region 4 statement and that's on pages 7 and 8 of that amicus brief and the answer, the question is -- you know -- how do you determine what is a modification? You know does something that doesn't increase the hours, the emissions per hour, constitute it? It says no. Since the modification does not cause any increase in the hourly particulate emissions, no increase in annual emissions should be calculated. They could not have said that any more clearly than --

Region 4 is not only Alabama, it is also North Carolina and South Carolina. And then, in the wake of this, right? 1982, North Carolina and South Carolina submit their SIPs and in their SIPs, certainly the South Carolina SIP expressly incorporates the concept of modification. North Carolina a little less expressly incorporates the entirety of the regulatory scheme under title 50 -- under part 51 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

They must have been starting on that in '87. So it seemed to me we have a mixed bag. Some people were saying the one thing. Some people were saying the other thing. And the later in time seems to be the Puerto Rico cement. And that was at least 17 years ago. And --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46789 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Justice Breyer, I think Puerto Rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem. Because what you are dealing with there is the elimination of two existing units, the two kilns, and a Official replacement with a brand-new unit, which would have been a modification under any -- I think under anybody's theory, because there would have been an increase in the hourly emissions anyway. So it would have been a NSPS subject to the PSD. It didn't get analyzed that way but the truth is it would have been fully -- the way that decision came out would have been exactly consistent with the way that they analyzed it.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46790 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The analysis which was probably pretty much based on what they said, I think was that the reason there was increased potential here to pollute, was really because this change would permit the plant to be run more intensively or more hours, something like that.

I'm not taking it as evidence of that. I'm taking it as evidence that the EPA then had a basic position similar to what they have now. That's what I'm using it as a basis for thinking that they were not saying to have a change, the Official word "change" includes only a change in physical facilities that increases the amount of emission per hour. Am I right? Or --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46793 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think they were really arguing that particular point. I mean, that's not the way I would have read the argument that EPA was making. But, and the bottom line is they didn't address this issue in WEPCO. To the extent they came close to addressing this issue in WEPCO they lost it in the Seventh Circuit because WEPCO adopted an interpretation that's much closer to what we are asking for. The answer given on the other side at this point, that we should have -- we should have sought a determination. Well, the problem with that, of course, is every one of these projects was being inspected. The record is replete with examples from North Carolina and South Carolina and EPA inspectors on site looking at every one of these projects.

And it seems to me that that cannot be what 307(b)(1) means. Justice Kennedy, you asked a great question. Should we have raised this in 1980, 1992, 2000? When were we supposed to bring this up? And the truth is in 1980 we interpreted this statute, the regulation, exactly the same way EPA did. It would have been silly for us to raise that. It is true that this issue comes up 25 years later in a bizarre proceeding. But that's not what 307(b)(2) is all about. It says you are precluded from making a challenge in an enforcement action if the action of the administrator was subject to challenge. Well, the action of the administrator was not subject to challenge in 1980. And when we did have the subsequent rulemaking --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46812 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Just a pause, under your view or the Fourth Circuit's view? If you read Judge Tatel's opinion in New York versus EPA, he suggests -- suggests, he says that EPA adopted different interpretations of modification from the outset. And so if what you are saying couldn't have been challenged, Official was the Fourth Circuit's view, that may not be accurate. But if you are saying what couldn't have been anticipated was the argument you actually made to the Fourth Circuit, that might be a different story.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46813 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. Well, I think that, that is precisely what we are saying. But you know, Judge Tatel, with all due respect to him, is dead wrong. Because the interpretation of modification under NSPS and under the regulatory PSD was identical. The regulations couldn't be any clearer in that regard because if you look at 15a of our appendix, you know, the modification, this is the NSPS definition -- I'm sorry, better go back a page. 17a. 60.14 modification defines emission rate and the emission rate is expressed as kilogram per hour. So that is absolutely clear that that is the NSPS -- Dobbs modification.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46815 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's the NSPS section. Then you go two pages earlier to 15a and you have the PSD regulatory definition, and it comes right back to emission rate, or the regulatory history that says the emission rate as used in this provides is identical --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46816 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # They say that that provision only applies when there is no SIP. And that's Official not this case.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46817 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in the first place it would apply in at least South Carolina immediately because there is a SIP that incorporates exactly the same language. And second of all, the notion that this regulation is inoperative on one side and fully operative on the other side make no sense. It makes much more sense to recognize that modification is the trigger for construction which is in part 51(2) and that that incorporates this entire modification language.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46818 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I don't understand that. It seems to me each part has had different definitions and this definition only applies to part 52 which applies when there is no SIP.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46823 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right. Go back to then -- you have to go back to 12(a), I think it is where we talk about the interpretation and we get to construction. This is (b)(8), construction means a modification, okay, of an emissions unit. So that -- and modification, if it is undefined in title 51, right? According to 15.100, Official means whatever it means under the statute. So that just takes you back to the statute. And this is the interpretation under the statute. The 52 interpretation is also an interpretation under the statute. So it is completely circular and brings you right back to the same definition. I agree by its terms it doesn't apply to 51. But going through the definitional provision in part 51 through the definition of the trigger for construction, which is modification, it takes you right back to the same meaning of the same provisions. So there is no difference between the two. And to me, it is really critical. And it seems to me there are sort of two points to make here. One is nobody on the Petitioner's side of this case answers the State -- the dozen States who say we relied upon you when we adopted these SIPs. We realized that you are asking us to take on enormous burdens. And you should have told us that before we went down this path in the first place.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46824 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Phillips, before you get away from this section 52, because I think that is the best section for your case, 52.01(d), is there, is there any sensible reason why you would want to have a different definition of modification for non-SIP Official situations than you would for SIP situations?

And the truth is if EPA wanted to achieve what it thought it was achieving, that is to eliminate the concept of modification, what it should have done is two things. It should have -- it should have deleted 52.01. And it should have adopted the proposed regulation that it didn't adopt from the 1979 regs. This is on page 9 of their brief. This statement is astonishing to me. "The term major modification serves as the definition of modification or modified when used in the act in reference to a major stationary source." If they had adopted that regulation in 1980, I wouldn't had to litigate this issue 25 years later. We would have litigated this question in 1980 because then we would have said that's flatly inconsistent with the statutory scheme because you're not entitled.

It doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now we can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it 12 hours a day. So there's going to be twice as much pollution in the air.

PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And it also seems to me, Justice Breyer, it clearly creates an obligation on the part of EPA to be very explicit if it's, in fact, going to do what you say it's going to do. You don't go about saying I am going to define modification in one statute fundamentally different from the way I define modification in another statute without discussing the word modification. Official And to put this in context, you'll remember, these regulations were adopted in the wake of the Alabama Power decision. Alabama Power didn't deal with the issue of modification. That wasn't before the court. Nobody had challenged modification's definition. The hourly emissions rate was a perfectly valid one. What the court in Alabama Power said is, you can't use this threshold for major modification. And then the case -- so then the matter comes back, and if EPA immediately adopts a new set of regulations that deal what, with what? Major modification, not with modification. And then they go through this entire elaborate analysis of major modification, none of which, candidly, do we challenge. We have no quarrel with their interpretation of the concept of major modification. If anybody does, my guess is the State environmental groups would.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46855 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # They make a kind of interesting argument, major modification is not a subset of modification.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46856 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yeah. And if the Solicitor, and if EPA had enacted the regulation that they proposed but didn't enact, that says major modification means modification, then we might have an argument there. But the concept that when you have modification as a core Official baseline construction -- I mean trigger for the applicability of this portion of the scheme, and then you take that same -- and you not only do it once but you do it twice, and you do it in the context of an entire regulatory scheme that was designed to implement this statutorily -- or implement this before the statute was enacted, and you have Congress saying well, you didn't get that right, but you did get this right, and they leave this language exactly in the way it is, the only fair inference you can draw from that, it seems to me --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46857 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why? Because the language, I don't see anywhere in the statute where -- the words of modification are, it's a physical changing or change in a method of operation which increases the amount of any air pollutant. Now those words, "physical change which increases the amount of any air pollutant," could mean different things in different places.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46860 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Where it says in the statute is where it makes this specific cross-reference, because if all they wanted to do was get that definition, all they had to do was use the word modification. They Official didn't have to use modification as defined --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46861 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Phillips, I want to be sure I understand your position. Are you saying the statutory text in effect says every regulation using the word modification must employ the same definition, or are you relying on a general principle that when the same word is used it should be used in the same way?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46862 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's a general principle that --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46863 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So there's nothing in the statute itself that says that principle shall apply to this case?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46864 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, but the general principle is that if the same language is used in two different portions, you presume they have the same meaning. When you go beyond that -- because otherwise, their interpretation rendered superfluous the specific cross-references to as defined in and as used in; and while I know some don't like the legislative history, the legislative history is quite clear that they had in mind, and regulatory history as well --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46865 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Your answer is you are not relying simply on the general principle. It is not just that they used the word modification in one place and the word modification in the other. It's that Official in the latter place, they said modification as defined in the first place.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46866 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It depends on which general principle, I suppose you're talking about. I'm not relying on the mere presumption. I think this is much stronger than the mere presumption.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46867 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But your reference of modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the scope of the statutory meaning. That's not the same as saying every regulation that is a modification must be the same no matter what the program.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46868 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think if you read it in context, when you recognize that what Congress was doing is adopting a statutory scheme that overlays on a regulatory scheme that was well established with very specific meanings, and where Congress quite clearly picked and chose -- I think that's the way to say it -- from the regulatory scheme, and said we'll take these and not take those, and has a provision at the end -- 168 says, all the regulations remain in effect until they get changed at some point, suggesting --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46869 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Let me just be sure I understand the point.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46871 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So you're saying that if you used the definition as defined in another statute, that implicitly says all regulations defining this term must be identical.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46872 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't know if I have to go quite that far because I have more evidence than that in this particular case, because I have the fact that they say as used in, which suggests that it's more than just a definitional point. We do have a legislative history that seems to have in mind this regulatory background; and we've been told by EPA that when Congress incorporated modification, it really did incorporate that luggage, baggage as well.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46873 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # This is very helpful to me, because the government has accused you of abandoning the court of appeals approach to the case, and I think you're endorsing the court of appeals.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46874 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I do endorse it. The only question I have -- I mean, I don't think that it necessarily has to be -- that every word has to be identical in the two provisions, but I do think they have to be congruent. And so, that's the strong version Official of our argument, and that's pretty close to where the Fourth Circuit was. The weaker version of our argument, which gets I think some mileage on the arbitrary and capricious part of the argument, is at a minimum, if Congress adopts as the trigger point the same word in two statutes, and EPA then purports to be implementing that statute, it has some obligation to explain how it is that they're doing a 180 with respect to the term modification. And the reason --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46875 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It's not just a matter of using the same word.

I mean, that would have been a much stronger argument. It seems to me the better argument, and -- but see, the point here is if they had done that, or if they had done what they proposed in 1979, which is just to simply redefine major modification to be modification, then we would have taken that issue directly to the D.C. Circuit at that point in time.
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46883 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But you do have a brief here. You have a brief filed in the D.C. Circuit, which is Brief For Industry Petitioners on Actual Emissions Definition.

There's a whole brief on that. So you already argued that whole brief, that what they were doing was inconsistent with the statute, et cetera.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46888 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, you have to put that into context. We're talking about a matter that was closed for 25 years and then was reopened. And this argument -- and it is true, a variant of this argument was made. I don't think it's the full argument that we've made before this Court. And it was rejected by the D.C. Circuit. But if you're arguing that as a 307(b) argument, my answer to that is this is still not action by the administrator that would trigger a 307(b) bar. If you're asking about collateral estoppel, my argument is --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46889 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. I was just thinking, then you're left with what you called the weak argument, arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because I don't see how you make the stronger one, what you think is stronger, since you made it before, or a version of it before the D.C.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46894 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # So you are doing it as -- see, I don't think it -- I think if you read 307(b)(2)'s language, it talks about action of the administrator, and what action of the administrator are we, in fact, challenging here? Nothing. Because in our view, the 1980 regulation quite clearly says what we want it to say. The only thing that's changed is that the preambles have interpreted the 1980. We challenged that and the D.C. Circuit said no, we're not going to address that issue. That's an issue when you get back up, when you get back on your enforcement action. Then you can complain about that aspect of it. That issue is not ripe. And that is exactly what we are trying to argue in this case. And it's a variant of what I think --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46895 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Phillips, can I go back for a second to the meaning in (a) includes the same meaning as in (b).

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46900 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right. Because there is no action of the administrator that we would challenge. The only action of the administrator was the 1980 regulation, which we interpret as not changing modification. If you read 52.01(d), it clearly retains modification. We have no quarrel, then, with what the administrator did in 1980. Then they adopt preambles to the subsequent regs. We do challenge those, but the D.C. Circuit said we're not entitled to do that, that's got to wait for an enforcement action. The only thing that's left out there is this sort of inchoate interpretation by the administrator. But there's no final action by the administrator for us to challenge. Then the only question would be, do we have some obligation --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46901 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You can't challenge in the D.C. Circuit the administrator's interpretation Official that led to the enforcement action?
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46902 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't know how that's a final action. The filing of a complaint, as this Court held in Harrison, is not a final action. So that doesn't trigger it, and I don't know what else is out there for us to serve as a hook. I would think at a minimum the Court would want to be very, very loathe to jump on a expansive interpretation of 307(b) where it operates in a context like this as a pure gotcha. You adopt regulations that nobody has a quarrel with, you change the regulation afterwards and then you come back and you say you can't challenge it at this point. That just cannot be a sensible interpretation of that statute. If there are no further questions, I would ask the Court to affirm the Fourth Circuit. Thank you.

You just can't read the 1980 regulations to achieve the result Duke is seeking here. There is no hourly rate in there, and it's important to note that these provisions that they now state misled them into Official their non-challenge, they didn't even cite to the Fourth Circuit or the district court, and on their face, they're not -- it's not plausible that these provisions, which are totally nonspecific, were intended to vary the very detailed and specific instructions on how to measure an emissions increase laid out. And the preamble --

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46909 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because it says rate, and the 1980 PSC regulations say that the relevant rate is tons per year. They use the word "rate" pervasively. I would also say the preamble to the rule makes conclusively clear that "major modification" is EPA's definition of the statutory term. This idea that EPA, it's completely inconsistent with not only --

EPA has never said Official otherwise. And of course the idea that an NSPS modification is required first, it would have been a big deal. There is no sign of it, and in fact there are specific examples. The example cited at page 23 of the government's opening brief in the preamble is a PSD major modification that would not be an NSPS --
argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46914 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's a tough sell, isn't it? I mean, the idea is you propose regulations saying major modification means modification.

argument in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation # 05-848 # 46915 # TRUE # MR. DONAHUE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that there's no other reading of what EPA meant from the regulations. No one was confused by this, Chief Justice Roberts. No one was confused. This argument, it's a new argument in this Court about how to read the rules, the 30 -- 52.01(d), 51.100, and 51.166(b)(8), all uncited below. It's really not plausible. The Court would have to abandon a lot of very basic principles of how to interpret legal texts to read the rules this way, and I think Judge Poisner was right on that.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46483 # FALSE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER #  # We'll hear argument first today in Washington v. Recuenco. Mr. Whisman.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46485 # FALSE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a judge, rather than a jury, decides a fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the applicable standard range, the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right is violated. This is true regardless of whether the fact is called an element or whether it is called a sentencing factor because elements and sentencing factors are functionally equivalent under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. It follows that the same harmless error rule that applies to missing or misdescribed elements should also apply to missing or misdescribed sentencing enhancements. In a series of Washington decisions, the Washington Supreme Court has held that harmless error analysis may never be conducted as to a missing or misdescribed sentencing enhancement simply because it is called a sentencing enhancement. This rule of absolute prohibition is inconsistent with this Court's jurisprudence and should be corrected. Before I go on, however, to explain the legal basis and the flaws in the legal reasoning of the Washington State Supreme Court, I would like to take a brief moment to address a few State law issues that have been raised by the Respondent's brief. The first is the question of whether or not at all in Washington we can, at present, seek deadly weapon enhancements or, more specifically, firearm enhancements. It was alleged in the Respondent's brief that we cannot, and I'd just point out to the Court that there is no authority in Washington for that proposition. And so asking this Court to simply affirm the -- the firearm enhancement that was originally imposed in this case does not constitute imposing a sentence that would any way be inconsistent with Washington law.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46486 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # On -- on that point, I have -- I have one question. At page 3a of the petition appendix, the Washington Supreme Court's opinion is set forth, and in the course of that opinion, it says, to the contrary, when defense counsel argued the definition should have been submitted to the jury, the prosecutor explicitly stated that the method under which the State is alleging and the jury found assault was committed was by the use of a deadly weapon. And then he goes on to say, in the crime charged in the enhancement, the State alleged there is no element of a firearm. The element is assault with a deadly weapon. I don't -- this was at the sentencing proceeding, I take it?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46487 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I believe that's correct, Your Honor.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46488 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes, because I couldn't find it in the sentencing proceeding.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46489 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In the -- in a subsequent or nearly subsequent breath, the prosecutor then asked for the enhancement, the 36-month enhancement, that applies for firearms. I think what you're seeing there is that the prosecutor was responding to the -- to defense counsel's use of the term element. And in -- in the year 2000, before Apprendi, before Blakely, we never would have used that term as applied to a sentencing enhancement. We just didn't think of it that way. Now, we have since changed our thinking, obviously, after Apprendi. But I think if you -- on the -- on the overall point, if you look at defense counsel's comments beginning with the comments pretrial, where he notes that I can see no relevance to -- to the admission of a different gun. Then he comments, Ms. Recuenco was threatened with a 380 automatic with a clip. Regarding the charge in particular, counsel at JA, page 30 says, the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under a theory of firearm. At JA 37, counsel said, the firearm is an element of this offense as it has been pleaded and argued to the jury and evidently, perhaps, obviously proven to the jury. So --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46490 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It does sound as if he thinks there was -- the prosecutor thought there was no error. A deadly weapon is a deadly weapon, and then --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46491 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's right. And -- and I think, Your Honor, that stems from the -- from the way the statutes are structured. Beginning many, many years ago, in Washington we had what we called a deadly weapon enhancement. And so there was no distinction made between any kind of weapon. In 1995, the law changed. There was a distinction made as to firearms. The -- the penalty was increased as to firearms. And so beginning that time, there was a material distinction depending on the weapon that was used. But I think that --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46492 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Was deadly weapon still an enhancement at that point, or was deadly weapon part of the definition of a new crime?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46493 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Deadly weapon was still called an enhancement, Your Honor, under the statute. And so the statute defined deadly weapon very generally, and then in the punishment section, the punishment provisions, which specifically were formerly under section 310 of the Sentencing Reform Act -- now it's been renumbered to be 533. Under that provision -- you have two provisions, one which provides the punishment for deadly -- for firearms, and under this -- for this case, that would be 3 years. And then as to the rest, it says if someone was armed with a deadly weapon other than a firearm, you have a lesser penalty. So as I say, I think that for a long time we have treated -- in Washington, we've treated all of these things as deadly weapons, but recognized that if it was a firearm, the penalty was greater than if it were something other than a firearm.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46494 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I thought the deadly weapon -- the definition of deadly weapon -- that that could include a revolver or a pistol.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46500 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. Our -- our position, Your Honor, is that it cannot, that if -- you either have a firearm or you have no enhancement whatsoever. If -- the only way that a -- that a gun could be a -- it's -- it's because of the language, other than a firearm. So, in other words, you have either a firearm and a 3-year enhancement, or you have, as I say, no -- no weapon enhancement at all. So, in other words --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46501 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, would it be either proper or required by the Washington trial court to tell the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the charge is assault? There is also the possibility of a sentence enhancement. It's a 1-year enhancement if it's a deadly weapon. It's a 3-year enhancement if it's a firearm and a pistol is a firearm. Would the judge err if he did that? Or another way of putting the same question, would it be proper for the judge to leave out the 1-year deadly weapon instruction and just instruct you can -- you must determine whether it's an assault and you must determine whether there's a 3-year enhancement for the use of a firearm?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46502 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We believe that's exactly what the court did in this case, Your Honor, by -- by instructing the jury that deadly weapon is firearm. In Washington, we never tell the jury --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46503 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No, no. My hypothetical is he says it's a 3-year enhancement if the deadly weapon is a firearm. That's -- what I'm asking is, in effect, under Washington law, is it error if the judge allows the definition of deadly weapon also to go to the jury so it can find a lesser included offense.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46504 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there -- there are two parts to the answer. Let me answer that one first. There -- our position is there is no lesser included offense of a firearm that's still a deadly weapon. And if you look at State v. Olney, O-l-n-e-y, that was one of the cases reversed in the Recuenco case, you'll see that -- that they explain why that's the case. In other words, it's either a firearm or there's no enhancement whatsoever. The -- the other part of the question I wanted to just clarify is that in Washington, we would not be telling the jury the length of time that -- that the defendant would face --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46505 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, then you're saying the instruction here was proper.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46506 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm saying that the instructions that went to the jury, correct, were -- were proper. What was improper in this case is that the special verdict form did not sufficiently or specifically enough preserve the jury's verdict so that, in other words, when the jury passed on this case and returned a verdict form that said deadly weapon, that did not expressly encompass the firearm. And so -- and that was -- that was the -- the mistake that was made in this case. We should have submitted a verdict form to the jury that would -- that would let a jury expressly describe what the verdict was.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46507 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Could you -- could you clarify one thing for me? I just want to be sure I have it in mind correctly. Is it correct that the firearm has to be an operable firearm?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46508 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That portion of the Washington law, Your Honor, isn't -- isn't crystal clear, but what I can say is that that's not in this case because trial counsel at -- at trial in more than one occasion specifically said it was irrelevant to this case. What we have to prove is that the firearm was a real gun, and --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46509 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But is -- just again, I'm not trying to find out the answer to what happened here, but just as a matter of what the law provides. Is it conceivable that a -- a gun which was not operable could nevertheless be a deadly weapon because it can be used as a club?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46510 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In that circumstance, yes, Your Honor.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46511 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It could be.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46512 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But -- but obviously, as counsel -- on page JA 31 and at JA 38, counsel very specifically said the State tries to say that the nonworking firearm would also be the basis for this offense, and certainly it can be. And then at -- at page 38, they say, obviously, the question of whether it actually worked or not would be irrelevant under the law. So the -- strictly speaking, the question of operability wasn't before the jury. We did have to prove that it was real. And, of course, there was never any dispute about that. The defendant's -- by the defendant's own testimony, for example, in the -- in the transcript at page 677 -- that would be volume 8, on 1/24/2000, page 677 -- the defendant spoke at some length about the fact that he was worried about his children getting a hold of this gun. There were significant safety concerns. At page 680, he talked about how he locks it up all the time.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46513 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Would you explain again why it was irrelevant whether the gun was operable or not?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46514 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Operability, Your Honor, is -- is -- there were a series of cases that -- that arose in Washington having to do with -- with a gun that was basically a real gun, but that there was something technically wrong with it. And those series of cases discussed how soon it could be rendered operable to make it still constitute a real gun. But I think that's really kind of an esoteric area of the law.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46515 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But to be a real gun, it has to be operable.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46516 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that's what the -- what the cases have said is that it only has to be ready -- could be made ready to -- to fire in a short amount of time, yes. As I say, that's simply not in this case because counsel conceded this gun -- that operability wasn't an issue here. All we had to prove was that it was a real gun.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46517 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Now, did you have to prove that because, as -- as I have assumed, the charge included the statement that he had used a handgun? Was that the term used?

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46520 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The charging document said the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon, which establishes the general category, and then, to wit, a handgun. As I say, there -- there was no issue either -- either pretrial or throughout the course of the trial that counsel knew precisely what he was facing.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46521 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But all that the jury found was deadly weapon because that's all they were asked to find.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46522 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's right. They only used the terms, deadly weapon, Your Honor, and that's why in the Washington State Supreme Court, we conceded that, technically speaking, the jury's verdict didn't encompass the firearm finding. The express verdict didn't encompass the firearm finding. But under the facts and circumstances of this case, it's our -- our view that that error, even though it could be an error, is harmless.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46523 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, you -- you could -- it could be argued that it not only didn't encompass the firearm finding, but it excluded the firearm finding. If, as you tell us, there are two categories, one being deadly weapon, which does not include firearm, and the other being firearm, wouldn't you say that the jury verdict positively contradicted?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46524 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, if you imagine a situation, as Justice Kennedy was posing, where the jury was presented with two options and they were going to choose one or the other, you might be able to make that argument. But here, the jury was presented only with the definition saying deadly weapon is a firearm, whether loaded or not. And under those circumstances and under the circumstances where the only weapon associated with this assault is a firearm, the only thing that they could have premised their decision on was the firearm. So, as I say, it's not as though they were choosing either or. In Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, you might have had that situation.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46525 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is the jury given a copy of the information?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46526 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They are ordinarily read a copy of the information, Your Honor, at the start of the case. I don't recall that being transcribed in the -- in the transcript as -- as the court has it. That is the ordinary course of proceedings. In -- in the Respondent's brief, there is a fair amount of time spent on distinguishing this case or -- or trying to analogize this case actually to charging defects. And as I've indicated already for the past few minutes, I believe that this case simply doesn't present that issue because it was readily apparent that this defendant was fully advised of what he was facing. Now, if there were other defects -- if there were true defects in the charging document or if the defendant was surprised by the sentence that the judge ultimately imposed, then we would have to analyze, separately analyze, whether or not the charging document was sufficient. And under this Court's jurisprudence and under Washington law, that is a separate analysis, a separate analysis --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46527 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Why was deadly weapon put in by the prosecutor at all? If -- if you're right that this is not a deadly weapon case, this is strictly a firearm case, it's not a lesser included, here the prosecutor charged deadly weapon --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46528 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Correct.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46529 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- to wit, a handgun. And then the special verdict form doesn't say one word about firearm. So couldn't the defendant expect, well, they charged the main thing? They charged me with deadly weapon, and they asked the jury to find deadly weapon.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46530 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And -- and I think to answer that question, Your Honor, again we have to step back to the year 2000 and -- pre-Apprendi, et cetera. At that time, there were a series of cases, Meggyesy, Olney and Rai, R-a-i, that -- that are overturned, quite frankly, by the Recuenco opinion, where the appellate courts had quite expressly said that it was sufficient to submit the deadly weapon verdict form in that form to a jury where it's clear that the only weapon at issue was a firearm. In each one of those cases, that was what was done. And in fact, in at least one of them, the victim was shot, so there couldn't be any question. So there was -- there was a well-established practice in Washington law at the time of proving that sort of thing. Now, it's true that the more thorough practice, the more precise practice would have been to submit a verdict form that said firearm, but that wasn't done in this case, but it wasn't done, I believe, pursuant to those cases. Unless the Court has any additional questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46533 # FALSE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Neder, this Court held that the failure to submit an element to a jury -- an element of a crime to a jury is subject to harmless error analysis because it is a nonstructural trial error. In Apprendi and Blakely, this Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury recognizes no distinction between elements that set a maximum punishment, sentencing elements, and elements of the underlying offense. For that reason, the failure to submit an element that sets the sentence to the maximum sentence available should be subject to exact same harmless error analysis that was applied in Neder. The exact same constitutional value and constitutional right is at stake. The exact same analysis of the effects of the error will be applied by the court, and it's the same sort of discrete error in time that you had in Neder. There's no functional distinction between Neder. In addition, in Schriro v. Summerlin, this Court held that the failure to submit a sentencing element to a jury is not the type of error that calls into question the fairness, accuracy, or reliability of the underlying proceeding. In Cotton, this Court held that that same type of error does not impugn the integrity, public reputation, or fairness of judicial proceedings. And in Mitchell --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46534 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Ms. Millett, can I ask you this one question? Would there ever be a case where it was not harmless error when the judge makes the finding? Isn't it -- wouldn't it be reasonable for the appellate court to assume, well, if the judge made the finding, it's probably supported by the evidence and presumably the jury would have come out the same way?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46535 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, I don't -- I don't think that's true, Justice Stevens, that there will be times -- I don't think this is one of those cases, but there will be --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46536 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But there might be a rare case, but in about 95 percent of the cases, wouldn't it be true that the fact the judge made the finding is pretty good evidence that the jury would have made the same finding?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46537 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think it will depend on whether the evidence was disputed before the judge in a -- in a -- in the Federal system would have been sentencing hearing. And remember, sometimes --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46538 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # The judge doesn't have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt, does he?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46539 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Exactly. Exactly, Justice Scalia. There's not only -- there may be disputed evidence, but the standard may be different. It's not clear whether it was here, but at least as to some factors. It's clearly not enough that there's sufficient evidence to support the judge's determination. The question would be whether there's any -- a jury could have found any doubt or when it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt, that the outcome would have been the same. But I do think in a case like this, it's important to keep in mind that it's -- this case illustrates that these things are not categorically or necessarily unamenable to harmless error review. And in fact, what would happen in cases like this and a lot in the Federal system, where you have undisputed, uncontested facts -- and we know that because they had the incentive to contest them at a sentencing proceeding. And so to hold that automatic reversal is required would mean it would go back for a retrial that would have nothing to do -- nothing to do with the element that was not decided by the jury. That would be undisputed. There's not going to be any contest back here that the firearm, the semi-automatic that was handed to the jury loaded and passed around to the jury, was a firearm. It would just be a second bite at the apple to contest things that were decided properly and beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury, consistent with the defendant's constitutional rights.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46540 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # What -- what do we do about the problem that is raised by -- by counsel on the other side, that Washington law is such -- or at least at the time the briefs were written, Washington law is such, as they understand it, that the -- that the issue could never properly have been submitted to the jury, and -- and therefore, if -- if Washington courts are going to follow Washington law, in every case in which a firearm is an issue, the case is going to be handled exactly like this? It's not -- the firearm issue is not going to the jury. The firearm determination will be made by the judge. If the State of Washington decides not to amend its law, we would have a situation in which, in effect, Apprendi is read out of the -- the constitutional law simply by State procedure. And in every case, the -- the response would have to be harmless error analysis on your theory. That is a pretty neat way to undercut Apprendi. Is that not a good reason to say we shouldn't have harmless error analysis?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46541 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, it's not, Justice Souter. First of all, the Hughes opinion on which they rely is crystal clear that the only thing the court found was that there was no procedure to re-empanel a jury on remand. And I point the Court to page 208 -- that's a P.3d citation and 149 in the Washington Reporter citation -- where the court specifically said, we are only talking about remand and not deciding whether these things could ever be submitted to a jury in the first instance.

MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that's right, but even if it weren't, if -- if you had some State that decided not to fix its law, in light of Apprendi and Blakely, I expect that what would happen is defendants would bring sort of -- there would be a facial constitutionality problem with any attempt to prosecute under that. And that may be the way to deal with it. There's no question of willfulness here. This is decided at a time when, in good faith, pre-Apprendi even -- this isn't even the Apprendi/Blakely window -- that it was acceptable to have this sort of two-tier proceedings much like we are used to in sort of a death penalty context.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46559 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the -- it's assault in the second degree which requires -- itself requires use of a deadly weapon. So it wouldn't even be assault in the second degree under Washington law without the jury finding a deadly weapon.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46560 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But you -- so -- so there had to be an instruction that there was an assault in the second degree?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46561 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There had -- there had to be a deadly weapon to have assault in the second degree, and then -- and I may not get all the nuances of Washington law, but then the jury had to have the sentencing enhancement, had to make a separate finding that the defendant was armed with a deadly weapon at the time. I'm not sure, again, if it's essentially redundant in second degree assault cases or not. It's a little confusing. But the -- the law required that you find a deadly weapon but it wasn't which deadly weapon. It was just a baseline eligibility, and then it was up to the court to decide which deadly weapon which would then dictate the sentence. And one other point I'd like to make clear is there's been some argument that this case is different from Neder because you have a completed defense. That is no different at all. You had a completed verdict for a non-offense in Neder, and the distinction between a judge making findings that make a verdict that support a non-offense into offense is not one that makes a structural difference. And in Carella v. California, Rose v. Clark, you had elements that stood on the fault line between lesser included offenses and greater included offenses. And now, there they weren't missing -- they weren't technically missing elements, but they were elements that were subject to mandatory presumptions by the jury. And yet, this Court said that they're subject to harmless error analysis. Now, obviously, the type of the element is going to affect the government's ability to prevail under harmless error analysis, and there may well be times when the government will not succeed in that process, especially as you get elements that are more central to, you know, the -- the crime and -- and traditional elements like the intent issues that were at issue in both Carella and in Rose v. Clark. The other point I wanted -- I wanted to make is that the fact that the jury verdict form here came back consistent with -- with the -- or the jury verdict form in Neder came back with the completed crime shouldn't make a difference. The change in the -- that jury verdict only came back because of a second mistake. The jury was wrongly and mistakenly told that if it found elements A, B, and C, it would -- it would establish a -- a completed crime. The fact that in this case you don't have that second error isn't again a difference that makes one error structural and the other nonstructural. The important thing is that the right is the same. The cost -- the right to the same, the ability of courts to analyze this error is the same. And on the other hand, a rule of automatic reversal will impose an enormous cost on victims and the public. Thank you.

I mean, your -- the -- the defendant might have come up and -- and presented evidence to the effect that it was only a starter pistol, in which case, okay, there would be a real issue. But in the absence of any reason to doubt that the handgun was what it purported to be, there would be no reason to -- there would be no requirement of further evidence about functionality, would there be?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46579 # TRUE # MR.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46583 # TRUE # MR.

For instance, it -- a -- a handgun that does not have the capacity to fire could be used to -- to strike an individual, and in that context would be a deadly weapon regardless of whether it was likely to cause a serious bodily harm.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46584 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No -- no question. But if there -- but if there is no reason to question its apparent functionality, I mean, you know, it's a handgun. It looks like a handgun. Somebody is holding it like a handgun -- there -- there is no reason, it seems to me, as a matter of fact or based on the statute to doubt that it would be functional.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46601 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because I think unlike Neder this case involves a jury -- or excuse me -- the -- a -- the wrong entity has determined the defendant's guilt not on the crime at issue --
argument in Washington v.

In our case, it happened after the jury reached a verdict. Now, absolutely true. And my question, of course, is why does that matter.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46603 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because in a scenario where the jury has been properly instructed and has returned a complete verdict --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46604 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, no. It was improperly instructed. The judge forgot to give this instruction about the nature of the firearm. I take it -- at least my case -- the judge forgets to instruct about the firearm. He just forgets. All right? And then the jury goes out. It comes back and the lawyer says, Judge, I handed you the instruction. Why didn't you give it? He says, oh, my God, I forgot. Now, does harmless error apply to that case?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46605 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that scenario is closer to Neder than it is to this case.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46606 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And I want to know why that matters because the only thing I've tried to create the hypothetical to matter is the one thing happens before the jury goes out, and the other happens after. And why does that matter?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46607 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think it matters because in a scenario like this, as opposed to either Neder or -- or the hypothetical, the only offense that has ever been litigated to the parties -- or by the parties to the jury was the lesser offense. The parties understood that only the lesser offense was at issue, and we know that because in response to Mr. Recuenco's motion to vacate, the State told the judge you aren't required to give the firearm instruction because that's not an element of either the substantive charge or the enhancement.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46608 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. But it's also the case, as I understand it, and as counsel on the other side confirmed a few moments ago, that the charge specifically specified that a handgun had been used. So this is not a case, as I think you were suggesting, in which there has never been a charge of the offense plus the enhancement they now claim. The -- the problem was in the jury verdict, not in the charge, not in notice to the defendant. And if that's the case, why isn't it just like Neder?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46609 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because, again, I go back to Washington law. And the fact that handgun is alleged in the information does not establish that it's a firearm because a handgun --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46610 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, a -- a firearm, as I understand it, is defined to include a pistol or a revolver. Is that correct?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46611 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It is.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46612 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All right. Isn't the natural reading of -- or understanding of the word handgun that it's a pistol or a revolver? I mean, isn't that what people would normally take it to mean?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46613 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That may be, but as a matter of Washington law, that's not the case. And it may defy common sense, but that's what it does.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46614 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but you're asking for a -- you're asking for a Federal constitutional ruling, and right now, if I understand you correctly, you're arguing that you ought to win because if you don't win, as a matter of Federal constitutional law, we would be condoning a verdict for an offense that was never charged. But if, in fact, handgun is properly read, properly understood to mean a pistol or a revolver, and that's what a firearm -- that's -- that's what a firearm is -- is defined to include under Washington law, then in fact the offense has been charged. The enhancement has been charged. And as a matter of Federal constitutional law, it seems to me that ought to be enough to bring it within Neder regardless of what the quirks of Washington law may be.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46615 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If, in fact, the allegation of handgun is sufficient to bring it in the context of Neder, then there -- there was no error at all. There would not have been a Blakely violation in this case. And the wrong -- the State was wrong all along to concede that there was because Apprendi doesn't just involve -- doesn't just say that sentencing elements are the equivalent of elements in the traditional sense. It says they're the equivalent of elements of a greater offense. And the State concedes and the Washington Supreme Court has found that, in fact, there was a Blakely violation in this case.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46622 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, when you say it's not litigated, do you mean simply that nobody, none of the witnesses, none of the counsel in argument, disputed that a handgun was there?

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46623 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # What I mean by saying it wasn't litigated is that it was the understanding of the parties at trial that the firearm element was not at issue because that had not been charged, that that was not the charge in front of the jury.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46624 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And -- and what do you -- what do you base that statement on? In other words, I -- I think you're now arguing that the understanding was that although it looked as though the -- the most serious enhancement had been charged, the understanding of the parties was that it had not been. If that's your argument, what is your basis for saying that?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46625 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Again, I could point to the -- the prosecutor's response in the motion to vacate. I can point to the court's judgment and sentence, which I don't have the cite for right off the -- my head, but it is in the joint appendix. On that form, as is common in Washington, there are two boxes for the court to check. One says that a verdict regarding a deadly weapon -- or excuse me -- that a firearm other than a deadly weapon was returned. The other says that a -- a -- excuse me. One says that a verdict form for finding that the person was armed with a firearm was returned. The other says that it was merely the verdict form for being armed with a deadly weapon other than the firearm. The trial --
argument in Washington v.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46627 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think it's -- it would be equally inconsistent with the State's current position if we look at JA 35 where the prosecutor's response was we didn't need that instruction because firearm was not an element of the crime charged.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46628 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Do you think it would have been error in this case based on the evidence presented and the way the -- the case was argued -- would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury that if they found that there was a firearm involved, they should make a -- they could make a -- a finding on that?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46629 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it's interesting because post Recuenco, after the Washington Supreme Court's ruling in this case, yes, that would be an error because after the Washington Supreme Court's decision in this case, what they said is that --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46630 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But as a constitutional matter, would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury in this case, based on this evidence, that they could return a verdict that a firearm was used as part of the assault?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46631 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # As a matter of constitutional error, no, I don't believe it would have been. But as -- but under Washington law, it was a verdict they couldn't -- as we know from Recuenco now, it's a verdict they couldn't have returned.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46632 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Ms. Millett tells us that that only applies on remand under -- under the Hughes case.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46633 # TRUE # MR.

As of this date, while the -- the legislature has amended the statutes at issue in Hughes, it has done nothing with respect to this statute. So, as it stands now, based on the recognition of the Washington Supreme Court that at the time of the entry of that decision, there was no provision to submit that question to a jury in Mr. Recuenco's case. There was also no provision to submit it to a jury in another case because prior to Recuenco, the only means by which the firearm enhancement could be obtained was pursuant to the decisions in Meggyesy, Rai, and Olney. And that was the very manner that was used here, and that was the very procedure that the Washington Supreme Court found violative of Blakely.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46634 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Mr. Link, will you just -- maybe I -- I should know this, but the information charges an assault in the second degree using the deadly weapon. If they had charged use of a firearm rather than a deadly weapon, what would the crime have been? Would that also have been assault in the second degree?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46635 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, that's an interesting twist under Washington law because the deadly weapon is -- is actually two elements of assault two. Under the substantive offense, it's a component of -- of assault, and also an element of the -- but to allege a firearm, it is possible that the substantive offense could have been elevated to assault one. It's also possible that it could have simply been an assault two with a firearm enhancement. So --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46636 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # The firearm enhancement itself would not covert it from second degree to first degree.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46637 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. And -- and I think this illustrates a point. Under Washington law, the State could charge assault three with a firearm enhancement in -- in a case in which a person used a gun. There's nothing under Washington law that requires the prosecutor to charge the greatest offense. There's nothing under Federal constitutional law that even if that greater offense is charged, that the jury must return a verdict on that greater offense. In fact, the jury, as the circuit breaker in the system, has always -- always has the right, regardless of the strength of the evidence and regardless of -- of what the trial court might view as the correctness of the charge, to return the verdict on the lesser.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46638 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You say regardless of the strength of the evidence. How about no evidence at all?
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46639 # TRUE # MR.

It -- it imposes deference on the trial courts that they cannot second-guess the jury, that because the jury is always free to return a verdict on the lesser offense, there simply cannot be a situation in which the trial court, based on its own assessment of the facts, gets to enter the greater.

Unlike Neder, there has never been a claim that there's any incorrectness in either the verdict in the charge or in the jury instructions. In fact, Mr. Recuenco from the outset had no reason to suggest that there was anything wrong because the State was free to charge him with the lesser offense, and they did. There would be no motive on his part to say, excuse me, Your Honor, I think I'm really guilty of a greater offense. Please ask the State to amend its information.

And -- and it's because of that -- that quirk in Washington law -- and the State offered us some suggestion of why that quirk exists. The deadly weapon provisions have been a part of the Washington sentencing scheme since its enactment in the mid-'80's. It was only about 10 years later that the additional enhancements for firearm were added, and -- and they were enacted by -- by a citizens initiative. And there's very little reference between the two of them. But they still exist together because there's nothing that suggests, again, that the State couldn't allege the lesser offense even where a handgun is -- is involved because it is the difference between a handgun with nothing more and a handgun that has the capacity to fire.

argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46673 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # As is consistent with Washington law, it's read to the jury at -- at the outset, but it -- it would be inconsistent, I think, with practice in Washington to have actually submitted the -- the information to the jury. In a situation like this, where the wrong entity has determined a person's guilt, despite the jury's complete verdict on a lesser offense, the application of harmless error simply eviscerates what Blakely sought to draw as the limits -- or excuse me -- as the -- as the outer boundaries of the jury's right. And in fact, it -- it's the equivalent of a second Sixth Amendment violation because in each instance, the jury's complete verdict on the lesser offense is being set aside. In the first instance, it's based on the trial court's review of -- of the strength of the evidence, and in the second instance, it's based on the -- the appellate court's review of the strength of the record to support not the jury's verdict, but instead the trial court's assessment of the proper charge.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46674 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, the other way of looking at it is it's based on trying to understand what the jury meant when it said deadly weapon when the only evidence of a deadly weapon they were presented was a firearm.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46675 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It assumes, I think, that -- that the -- it assumes the correctness of the judge's -- of the trial court's assessment of the facts rather than simply accept the -- the jury's verdict for what it was because, again, as a matter of Washington law, Mr. Recuenco could be found guilty of assault two with a deadly weapon even if he used what appeared to be a handgun, absent some proof of capacity. And again, as a matter of -- of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, even had the State put together evidence establishing the capacity of the instrument to fire, the jury would have been free to return a verdict on the lesser offense of deadly weapon, even if it were to contradict Washington law on that point. The jury would --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46676 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And in Neder, even if the jury had been asked to rule on materiality, it could have decided not to rule according to the evidence. The same argument applies in Neder.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46677 # TRUE # MR. LINK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But -- but, again, in Neder, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the offense that was litigated to it and based on the parties' understanding of what offense was at issue. In this case, that doesn't happen. And, again, it's illustrated by the prosecutor's response to Mr. Recuenco's motion to vacate, and it's illustrated by the court's judgment and sentence, which is at page 14 of the joint appendix, where it specifically finds that the only verdict -- and -- and again, doesn't question the verdict -- that the only verdict returned was deadly weapon other than a firearm. It doesn't assume that the jury found that it was the firearm verdict. It doesn't make that assumption. It recognizes that verdict for what it was. But based on then-existing Washington law, which Recuenco overturned, it concluded it had to impose the firearm enhancement. So there's no suggestion by either the parties or the trial court or the Washington Supreme Court, for that matter, that there was anything wrong with the jury returning a verdict of deadly weapon because, as a matter of Washington law and as recognized by each of those -- those entities, the jury -- the jury could do that, and they did. Refusing to apply harmless error in this case doesn't require a single retrial of a single individual. Unlike the normal case, unlike Neder itself, in -- in those cases, had harmless error not applied, the defendants would have been entitled to a new trial. That's not true after Blakely. At best, what would happen is -- is defendants would be remanded back to -- to the various trial courts for the reentry of the sentence that's supported by the -- the jury's verdict. There will be no need to conduct new trials. There will be no need to do anything, other than that simple ministerial act. There simply is no prudential reason. There won't be the flood of -- of retrials or -- or the prison doors thrown open for -- for people to walk free with no convictions.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46678 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I -- I take it Washington wouldn't have the option -- suppose that you prevail.

The Washington Supreme Court correctly held that harmless error analysis could not apply where the trial court has set aside the jury's complete verdict on a lesser offense in favor of a judgment on the greater, both as a matter of State and Federal law. And Mr. Recuenco would ask this Court to affirm that decision.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46684 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, counsel. Mr. Whisman, you have 4 minutes remaining.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46686 # FALSE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Whisman, can I -- can I ask you a hypothetical which I think puts in starker form what the -- what your colleague here says this case involves? Suppose that -- that you have a statute, a murder statute, which applies to the murder of a single individual, but -- but you have another statute with a death penalty called aggravated murder. And it's a different crime and it -- it requires the -- the killing of more than one person in -- in the same -- in the same event. Let's assume a trial in which somebody came into a bank with a machine gun. Only one person came in, and five people were killed. But the prosecution only brought a prosecution for simple murder. Okay? And the jury comes back with a verdict for -- for simple murder. Certainly a judge would not be able to say, well, no jury could possibly have found simple murder here without also thinking that this person was guilty of -- of this greater offense of -- of aggravated murder and, therefore, I'm going to enter a judgment of aggravated murder. That's what the -- the defense says happened here, that there was just a verdict of -- of the lesser offense. That's all the jury found. It could have found more and maybe -- maybe in finding that, it -- it must have thought that the greater offense also existed, but it never came in with a verdict for the greater offense. Now, tell me why what happened here is different from -- from the hypothetical.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46687 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think the key difference is the charging part of your hypothetical. Your hypothetical assumes this defendant was never put on notice that he was facing aggravated murder, and if that were true, then under your cases and under -- under our Washington law, we would analyze that as a failure of notice. The -- and it could have any number of implications for a defendant, including the evidence that they marshal at trial, but also including perhaps his interest in negotiating a plea agreement if a defendant doesn't know that he's facing aggravated murder at the end. So --
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46688 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, suppose under Justice Scalia's hypothetical, aggravated murder is -- is in the charging documents, but the judge doesn't say aggravated murder when he submits it to the jury.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46689 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Then I think that is susceptible to harmless error analysis, Your Honor. And it would be -- there would be an open question as to whether or not, of course, it is harmless, but then I think that we're back to the Neder situation.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46690 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But then we'd have Justice Scalia's case if this information left out the words, to wit, a handgun.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46691 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # You would be closer to Justice Scalia's case, Justice Stevens, yes. Although under Washington law, we analyze the charging document and the sufficiency of it and ask whether or not it was -- the words used sufficiently appraised the defendant. But I think the defendant would have a stronger argument for the fact that he didn't know what he was facing if you had that hypothetical.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46692 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And those are the sort of considerations that can be taken into account under harmless error analysis. Right? The absence of notice, the prejudice. I would have put on this evidence if I had known I was accused of using a handgun.
argument in Washington v. Recuenco # 05-83 # 46693 # TRUE # MR. WHISMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They can be a component of the harmless error analysis. Ordinarily in Washington, we would handle that as a charging document challenge. In other words, the defendant would say I was never charged with this crime and therefore I didn't marshal my evidence, et cetera. It's a due process violation. Either way, I don't think that the -- the conviction stands much chance of surviving. I did want to answer, first, a question that had been raised by pointing the Court to JA 18 where the defendant says, my proposed instruction makes clear that the deadly weapon in question is the firearm, that -- not that some other kind of weapon might have been deadly. So I think that focuses the issue appropriately. I also wanted to point out that Justice Alito's hypothetical is really the State v. Williams case that we cited at page 14 in our reply brief where the defendant was expressly charged firearm and the victim was shot during the course of the crime. And the issue didn't go -- the -- the same verdict form as we have here -- in other words, it said only deadly weapon -- was given to the jury, and the Washington court of appeals, feeling itself bound by Recuenco, reversed that finding. So I think that the opinion of the Washington Supreme Court is unduly broad and should be overturned.

OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has never addressed the constitutionality of photo buttons worn by spectators during a criminal trial. The two closest decisions of this Court, Estelle v. Williams and Holbrook v. Flynn established only a general rule that some courtroom practices may be so inherently prejudicial that they violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Neither Flynn nor Williams --
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46260 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, it went a little bit beyond that. I mean, the -- Justice Marshall announced not merely the possibility of inherent prejudice, but he spoke in terms of practices that raised a risk that improper factors would come into play in the jury decision. Isn't that the criterion?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46261 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # An unacceptable risk, Your Honor.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46262 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's the criterion.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46263 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the test has been formulated different ways --
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46264 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's the way he formulated it. That's the way the Court in Flynn formulated it.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46265 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In Flynn, it did, but it also, just a paragraph or so earlier said that the only question we need to answer is whether this practice, and there the courtroom uniformed guards, is so inherently prejudicial that it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial. We don't believe that those are material --
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46266 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That was the end point that they were reaching, and then he elaborated on that by referring to the unacceptable risk that improper considerations would come into play. And it seems to me that if you're going to talk about the criterion of the test or the standard, however you want to describe it in Flynn, you've got to get that latter point about unacceptable risk of improper factors.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46267 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That certainly was a formulation of the test. It's been -- we can accept it as the formulation of the test. And it was accepted by the California courts below. They attempted to apply that test. They announced the proper -- the correct clearly established law of this Court, and then proceeded to analyze the issue. Below, however, on Federal habeas review, the circuit court of appeals used its own circuit case to define clearly established law under AEDPA. Instead of assessing the state court's application of the general rule, the circuit court narrowed this Court's general rule into one that specifically condemned buttons. Instead of granting the state court wide leeway to apply this Court's general rule, it -- the circuit court created a narrow rule that would seemingly prohibit buttons in any case.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46268 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I suppose if the court of appeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme Court rule to be as follows, it could then later say in case B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court rule, and we're bound by case A. This is the elaboration we've given to it. And we have to find that the state court, of course, isn't bound by what we do, but we're bound by what we do when we review what the state court has decided.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46269 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Your Honor makes a distinction between a post-AEDPA case and pre-AEDPA cases. In a post-AEDPA setting, it is -- the circuit court of appeals is looking at its own post-AEDPA case -- post A-E-D-P-A, AEDPA case which has said that this set of facts constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established law. We don't disagree that stare decisis might come into play there. It doesn't mean that that first decision was correct, but we don't -- what happened here in contrast was a pre-AEDPA decision that was used to define the clearly established law of this Court, give it more detail such that the circumstances here fell outside of it.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46270 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # To apply an opinion of this Court to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not necessarily to say that that is clearly established Supreme Court law.

argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46271 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46272 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I mean, they're forced to decide it one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either means this or that. They're not applying a clearly established test to the Supreme Court, are they?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46273 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Not by doing that. However, the circuit court of appeals here expressly stated it was looking to its own circuit authority to define the law that is clearly established. It specifically stated that this case, that the state's decision was unreasonable in light of Norris. It specifically stated that the state court's decision could not reasonably be distinguished from Norris.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46274 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # We're looking under AEDPA at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. What do you do in a situation where you think the state court has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but nonetheless reached the correct result? In other words, correct understanding of the established Supreme Court law would have led to the same result as their incorrect articulation of it.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46275 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, at first, the -- the first thing to do would be to look at the fair import, as this Court stated in Wilford v. Biscotti. Look at the fair import of the decision. Now, I don't know if you are referring to the issue about the arguable misarticulation of the text at the end of the state court's decision here, but the first question is to look at the fair import. And if the fair import is that the correct test was applied, then habeas relief does not lie.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46276 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Right. My hypothetical, and we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is let's say that the state court wrongly articulates Supreme Court law. But under the correct articulation, it leads to the same result. What happens in that case under AEDPA?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46277 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I believe that the habeas relief should not lie. Now, I have seen circuit courts treat it different ways. Some courts will decline to give deference and review it de novo, but I don't think Congress intended, in enacting AEDPA, the A-E-D-P-A, that a state habeas -- a state conviction should be overturned simply because of an accident in a statement or formulation of the test, but the conviction is otherwise constitutionally balanced --
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46278 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You are actually saying the answer to the Chief Justice's question is that you would then review it de novo. But on de novo review, you would sustain the conviction if it came to the right result.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46279 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. I believe so. If I understood you correctly -- the question correctly, yes.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46280 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You would not affirm -- you would not sustain the conviction relying on AEDPA.

argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46281 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, with the caveat that we're assuming that the hypothetical is that the state court has misapplied, that the fair import has -- they have misapplied the holdings of this Court.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46282 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Correct.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46283 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It misarticulated them. I guess the question of application is -- I mean, I assumed they reached what we would regard as the correct result under the correct standard, they just articulated the wrong standard. Your answer, I take it, is that it would then be reviewed without AEDPA deference?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46284 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Your Honor. Then I misunderstood the question. The deference would still apply if you could look at the decision as a whole and see that the correct standard was applied. If they have erroneously stated the standard -- if the state court erroneously stated the standard, but you can look to the decision as a whole, and see that the correct standard was nevertheless applied, deference is still due.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46285 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # We're concerned here with the court of -- the role, if any, that a circuit court, that opinions of courts other than this Court have in determining whether law is clearly established. Do you exclude entirely from the province of what is proper for the Federal court to consider any court of appeals, Federal court of appeals decisions?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46286 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, we do, Your Honor.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46287 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So that the only thing -- your argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are decisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then that's the end of it?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46288 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Your Honor. We -- our position is that a Federal habeas court may not look at all to state or circuit authority on the question of what is clearly established, only the holdings of this Court, and what appears on their face. If there's a general rule, such as here, the question moves to the reasonable application prong. And under that prong, because the rule is general, as this Court stated in Yarborough versus Alvarado, the more general the rule, the more leeway there is. Relief can still lie under certain circumstances, but it's -- it moves into a question of objective reasonableness of the state court's decision.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46289 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Suppose all of the -- suppose there are five circuits. They're the only ones that looked at the issue. And they all say, we think the general rule of the Supreme Court is as follows, isn't that entitled to some weight? You're not supposed to cite that when you go to the Sixth Circuit court or you go to the state court?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46290 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If Your Honor is speaking only to the clearly established prong, my answer would be no. If a circuit court says Jackson v. Virginia is clearly established law on the sufficiency of the evidence, we have no dispute with that. But to redefine or shape this Court's holdings beyond the face of those holdings, our position is that cannot be done with state or circuit law. Circuit law and state law may be relevant to the question of reasonable application, but not on the first prong. If a Federal habeas court looks to circuit or state authority on the first prong of 2254(d)(1), the reasonableness becomes a foregone conclusion. The two -- the two sections of the statute collapse into what is essentially de novo review, as what happened here. Once, for instance, the habeas court here decided that its own circuit authority required -- or prohibited buttons, reasonableness was a foregone conclusion, even though it was addressed by the circuit. But in further response to your question, Your Honor, our position is that on the reasonable application prong, a Federal habeas court may look to state and circuit cases. They are of varying relevance, but they should look to state and Federal circuit cases equally, but not all those cases have the same relevance. We have -- there is a distinction between pre-AEDPA and post-AEDPA cases, and the distinction between whether those cases support or contradict the state court's opinion.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46291 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So would there be any difference if this had been a post-AEDPA -- if the circuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46292 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There would be a difference, Your Honor. The -- depending on the prong we're looking at, under -- our argument would still be the same under -- on the clearly established prong of 2254(d)(1), that even if Norris was a post-AEDPA case, that the circuit court could not look to Norris to define this Court's holdings. But Norris, if it were a post-AEDPA case would have more relevance on the reasonable application prong. There, stare decisis might come into play. It doesn't mean Norris is correct. It doesn't mean that the result reached by the circuit court of appeals in this case would be correct, but it would certainly be more relevant.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46293 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Can you tell us -- let's assume for a minute that this case were on direct review, that we don't have AEDPA.

argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46294 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That is a test, the test, one of the formulations of it.

The state court judge should look at the circumstances before him and determine whether he believes that there is an unacceptable risk of impermissible factors coming into play. Whether the practice at issue, whether it be buttons or ribbons or what have you, is so likely to prejudice this defendant or violate or infringe on his fundamental rights that we need to order them removed. Not just as a matter of supervisory power, but as a constitutional requirement. So it is a spectrum test, Your Honor. And it's essentially a totality test of the circumstances of the buttons, let's say, and there can't be a bright line rule. The circumstances --
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46299 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why couldn't there be here? I mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in this case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not exaggerate. But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea. For obvious reasons. Now, at some point, if enough judges say that, each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that inherent risk that it's unconstitutional. But if some point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and unconstitutional?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46300 # TRUE # MR. OTT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, my answer is no. As a supervisory matter, a state court can do whatever it wishes. Under the state constitution, state statutes, state rules of court, can do many things under its supervisory power or even state constitutional power. That is different altogether, however, from saying that all buttons violate the Constitution, which is different in turn from saying all buttons require habeas relief.

Suppose you think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners, posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea. Now, why? Not just because of decorum. But because they introduce an extraneous factor into the judgment of the jury. And suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do, I'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw lines among buttons. It is pretty hard to draw lines among banners. And the only way to guarantee fair trials in whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this. No buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters.

And this Court obviously has the power to enact a prophylactic rule that -- but a prophylactic rule covers many unconstitutional as well as constitutional practices.

It just conveys, at most, to the jury, you know, this is -- we have been deprived of someone we love, you should take this matter very seriously and consider the case carefully. It is an important matter to us. And therefore, you ought to deliberate carefully. I don't know that it means anything more than that.

FERMINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I want to direct this Court's attention to the state court opinion which appears at 55A to 78A of the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari in this case. I want Your Honors to take a look at that opinion. It is 25 pages in length, but the portion of the opinion dealing with the buttons issue is two pages in length. Of those two pages, all but a few sentences deal directly with the Norris case. I believe it is at roughly page 72A in their -- 73A of the appendix. All but three sentences deal with the Norris case. The Attorney General has said in its briefing that the court below teased out the particular reference to the buttons, that it carefully parsed the opinion, that it gave a tendentious analysis. This is the description of the Attorney General. Nothing could be further from accuracy. These two pages discuss Norris head on. It is the elephant in the room, if you will. The court below could not have -- it would have been impossible for the court below to write this opinion without addressing the Norris case head on.

Nobody has told them what the button is about. Nobody has put for the judge a picture of it. Nobody showed him what the button is. So he says a simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family member. Period. Now, what else is there to say? That's the court's conclusion. And it is pretty hard for me -- I looked for the button. I couldn't even find the button in the record. I didn't even know what this looks like. It is a button, somebody later must have said two inches to four inches. I don't know who said that. I don't know how the judge could have known that. The button isn't in the record.

But I think what -- where the court erred is in adding and grafting on an additional element. It goes beyond that sentence that, Justice Breyer, you focused on. I think it is that the -- it is the element of branding. It's that this wearing of the buttons in a sense branded the defendant in the eyes of the jurors.

It used Norris by way of negative explication to show that the facts before it didn't fall within the rule as derived from Williams and Flynn. And I think that goes beyond respect to the Ninth Circuit. I think it took the case, it grappled with it, it decided that it was different than Norris.

I think they're probably a problem. I think all judges are concerned about them. But then I think about this particular case. And I look at that single sentence: "It was unlikely to be taken as a sign of anything other than normal grief." I mean, suppose this had been a different case. Suppose the defense in this case was the defendant Smith didn't pull the trigger. It was an unknown person called Jones. Then if I were on the jury, I would look out, see the buttons, and I'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was Smith. Otherwise they wouldn't be here with those buttons. I could think that. But this isn't that case. This is a case where everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger. The only question is whether the family's son came at him with a machete. So when I look at the buttons, I'd think sure, they don't think the son came at him with -- I mean, they don't think that. He's their son. What would you expect them to think? So that's why I thought that they are saying that sentence, in this case. In this case, it would be taken as sign of grief and nothing more.

However, I think you've also identified one -- the problem with this. It is the risk, not the reality. And that's why we have to look beyond the facts of this case and look to the rule as derived from the Williams and Flynn case, as I think the court below properly did. And in doing so, in applying it to this case, I think you have to do away with this kind of courtroom behavior. It is simply not acceptable. It is not acceptable to wear --

And they may not like the person accused of murdering their son. That is not -- that is sort of like in every case. That's not -- the buttons don't seem to add much to what the jury will derive from seeing the family seated behind the prosecution bench.

argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46401 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But in Williams and Flynn and all of the cases that we have had, whatever way they went, it was always the government requiring a defendant to do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court with shackles.

No buttons, no signs, no banners. A courtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a demonstration of any kind. Now, if I were to think that, and I also were to think it's just too difficult to figure out case by case whether there is or is not an improper influence, suppose I thought both of those things. Now, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side says: One, you're supposed to decide whether this was clear in the law. Two, if you're worried about the future, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law either because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta. All right. You write for me the words I'm supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46418 # TRUE # MR. FERMINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Breyer, I think that the rule derived from the Williams and Flynn cases is that courtroom -- courtroom behavior that creates an unacceptable risk that impermissible factors have -- or have caused a jury's verdict to be based not solely on evidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial. And unless it advances some important state interest, some compelling state interest like the concern that I believe Justice Ginsburg raised about the forcing a defendant to appear in prison garb or the shackling cases, that rule I think allows the opinion in this case of the court below to not violate the prescriptions of the AEDPA. I think that's clear. I think what the court below did was essentially apply the rule that I just discussed. And I think --
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46419 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So what about -- what if the issue was mourning? The trial is being held and the families appear and they're all in black because they're still in mourning. Does that violate this clearly established rule?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46420 # TRUE # MR. FERMINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think you're getting -- Mr. Chief Justice, I think the hypothetical gets closer to it as well. I think a defendant's -- excuse me, a victim's family wearing, appearing in court every day wearing black gets closer to the kind of message import -- again, the risk, not the reality -- that this case is -- that the court below was concerned with.
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46421 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, my question is under AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going to keep the family out even in mourning, that would violate the clearly established rule that you've just articulated?

argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46425 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And so you've got -- I think you've got a stronger argument. The problem that I have in this case is that, number one, I view the wearing of the buttons, as I just described it, as something that is abnormal and something that is intended to presumably get the jury's attention. I don't know why otherwise they would be doing it. And from whatever source, we do know that the button was at least two inches wide and maybe larger. So it's reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and understood perfectly that these were people who were raising, in effect, an issue of sympathy. I can understand that, and under the general rule out of Williams and Flynn, it seems to me there's a pretty darn good argument for saying, yes, an unacceptable risk has been raised of emotionalism in the jury's deliberations as opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom evidence. What, however, do I make of the fact that not one single court has ever reached that conclusion and -- you know, as a constitutional matter? Am I in the position of sort of being Jim, and they're all out of step with Jim? I'm raising a question about my own judgment in relation to the fact that no other court seems to have come to that conclusion. What do you think I should make of that?
argument next in Carey versus Musladin # 05-785 # 46426 # TRUE # MR. FERMINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think it is a factor to consider in the Court's analysis. However, I think the facts of this case are unique precisely because this typically doesn't -- we don't get this far because most trial judges don't allow this kind of conduct.

And there may be relatives of the defendant in a criminal case. There may be relatives of the victims. And it's apparent from their behavior what they think about the case and which side should win. And that's sort of a baseline that has to be accepted in judging, not whether wearing buttons is good as a -- whether we think it would be good if we were announcing a court rule, but whether there's a violation of due process. Do you accept that?

Let's assume that the buttons were big enough that they could recognize that the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose murder the trial was about. Let's assume all that. What risk is that? You know, during sentencing I can understand, oh, he caused so much grief to so many people, once we found him guilty, we should sock him with a stiff sentence. But during the guilt trial? I mean, I see, gee, the victim's family loved him a lot. This guy must be guilty. That doesn't follow at all. In the guilt phase, I don't see how that can have any effect on the jury.

Isn't it enough if there is an influence that is conveyed? I mean, what I thought the problem was, was that there was as a result of the obtrusive wearing of the button, that it created a risk simply of an emotional approach to the determination of guilt or innocence. The jurors are more likely to feel sorry for the family members sitting there a few feet away from them. Perhaps they may be more likely to feel sorry for the victim, but certainly for the family members. And it would be that improper influence of emotionalism as opposed to a particular message that is the problem here, isn't it?

It is clear that everyone involved has had a concern with the wearing of buttons or any other kind of introduction into the proceeding that would otherwise not be subject to meaningful adversarial testing, and I think that's the problem in this case. And I do believe if you look closely at the state court opinion in this case, you will see that the court below's opinion was correct, that they did not tease out of the opinion or parse or apply any kind of tendentious reading, when you look at exactly what the state court decided.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46010 # FALSE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental question in this case is whether the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the FELA. The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most clearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the middle paragraph. And I think it is worth taking a second to read it. The rules which determine the causal relation between a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm resulting to him are the same as those determining the causal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct and resulting harm to others. That is a principle of law that has been in effect long before the Federal Employers Liability Act was enacted. It is obviously a restatement of the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear Official statement of the law as it applies today. There is nothing in the Federal Employers Liability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of equivalence. The two provisions, section 51 talks about negligence resulting from -- or negligence in whole or in part. And section 53, which describes the contributory negligence portion or comparative negligence talks about negligence attributable to. None of that deviates at all from any kind of common law doctrines. Negligence inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46011 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Except that the -- what was it, the Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the negligence of the defendant. The basis for that holding was that in whole or in part language which is used for the negligence of the defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence. So if you believe that that case was at least decided for the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.

PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, even if that were true, we would still, of course, be entitled to -- I mean, it doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence. It doesn't say that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect Official to the -- our clients --

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46014 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The plaintiff would be. That doctrine is unaffected by that holding. Now, I'd like to take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you want, at this point. But it seems to me the doctrine of equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine of proximate causation. And therefore, you can change one without affecting the other one whatsoever.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46015 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Phillips, the fundamental problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the judge gave on negligence. There was an instruction requested by the defendant on contributory negligence, which read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injury." That was the only instruction objected to, because the refusal to give that instruction. But you seem to be using that as a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which no objection was made.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46016 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's not our attack, Justice Ginsburg. Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of the cert -- of the petition's appendix, that says -- and I think the current MAI instruction has a different causation standard for comparative fault, meaning that Official under Missouri's rules, we must prove that such negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause -- to cause the injury. And that misstates the law, because of the doctrine of equivalence. That's our initial argument, is that no matter how you analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate way to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to be applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence. That's the core doctrine. That's what we sought certiorari on. The argument with respect to Rogers was not an argument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg. It's an argument that the Respondent put into this case.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46017 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I take it you would be satisfied -- not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and we think the instruction on contributory negligence was correct. Because that would mean in the next case, you would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's negligence.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46018 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We would regard that as certainly at least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf. But at the end of the day, I think the right answer in this case is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide Official whether or not Rogers really did work a sea change in the law.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46019 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If we came out the way I just described --

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46023 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But I thought you argued the Rogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri court?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46024 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We clearly did that, Justice Kennedy. And we didn't raise -- we are not here complaining about Rogers as an argument for why we shouldn't be liable. That's not our -- we're not criticizing that. What we're saying is, in response to the Respondent's argument which seeks to undermine the doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would argue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect. And if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect, we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two different reasons. Official The first one that Justice Souter described. And the second one would be that to the extent that there's any equivalence, there's no problem here because proximate cause is required in every case. And we think that that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to decide, but certainly could. I'm sorry, Your Honor.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46025 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Phillips, the defendant requested a charge on contributory negligence that read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injuries." You didn't want the direct relationship, you didn't ask for that. You asked for one that said, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to his injury." Now you are saying that that was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46026 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, what we're saying, Justice Ginsburg, is that we were entitled to the same -- if they were going to use slight negligence with respect to our negligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's negligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as well. That's our fundamental argument. That's the issue we have put on the table. And candidly, I don't think there's an answer to that that's been offered in this case, other than a harmless error argument, which I think is candidly without substance. Official The issue, then, is whether in evaluating the doctrine of equivalence, do you want to then entertain the plaintiff's or the Respondent's counter argument, which is that somehow Rogers requires this fundamental change, and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence as it applies to FELA. And I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence at all. And, two, to the extent it does speak to it, it was never meant to change the fundamental rule with respect to proximate causation.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46027 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Except we've rejected petitions for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times. Eleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers required. You --

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46031 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But you were wise enough not to ask for that. (Laughter) Official
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46032 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But you know, the basic -- the point here is that if you look at the decisions that have analyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think any of them has analyzed it with much care. And the reality is the Third Circuit has analyzed this case with care, and reached the opposite conclusion. We think there is a split in the circuits. And at some point, if not through this vehicle to address that issue, then through another vehicle to address that issue. But, yes, it seems reasonably clear that, first of all, there were at least 20 decisions of this Court dealing not only with the sufficiency evidence, but also with the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to Rogers that refer specifically to proximate causation. There is nothing in the statute that remotely meant to change that. There is nothing that's been identified in that context. It is at least clear to me, and I hope clear to five of you --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46033 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Rogers said, in whole or in part. Now, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it. But Rogers said that it did it.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46034 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But what Rogers saying in whole or in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation standard existing in Missouri. And Missouri's proximate cause standard talked about sole causation. And this Official Court said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation can not be the right standard for proximate cause. The Court was not asked to decide, and I don't think it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is traditionally understood, was also thrown out the door, or more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury instruction that calls for proximate causation to be given to both parties -- I'm sorry.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46035 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Phillips, I may be lost a bit here. But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the instructions that were given. And it seems to me it is hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's part because it tracks the statutory language. The statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction says in whole or in part. So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence, your objection seems to be to the directly contributed language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff. Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a typical proximate cause instruction?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46036 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, that is a typical proximate cause instruction, and that meant that our burden was heavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're saying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're entitled to the equivalent instructions. Whatever they Official are. If it is slight cause or proximate cause.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46037 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Right. But on the other hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause. You are saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46038 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. But we are only doing that in response to the Respondent's argument. I'm not -- we didn't bring to this Court an affirmative argument that said we are entitled to no liability because of proximate cause. That's not the argument we made. The argument --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46039 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # How is the blue brief in response to Respondent's argument?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46040 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because if you look at the opposition to the cert petition, which took us to task for not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on page 6, "inexplicably, petitioner does not cite, let alone discuss Rogers, an omission that enfeebles its entire discussion of FELA's causation standards." Against that kind of an attack, we felt it incumbent on us to deal with Rogers.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46041 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # As we're supposed to decide the case, in your view, there was instruction 13. Instruction 13 used the word direct.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46043 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You object to 13. You said it should use the word in whole or in part. Official

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46045 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You then argued to the lower courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part. And then you say you've argued that here. So what you're saying is now we're supposed to decide, should instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's what it is. I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of the blue brief. I thought you were arguing something else about railroad negligence. But you're not now, you say, arguing about railroad negligence. You're arguing about plaintiff negligence.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46046 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, we're arguing both.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46047 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # All right. So if I reread the blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination, that your real objection, not responding to the other side, has simply been about the standard to use in respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence. And what you want this Court to say is, you're right about that, we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory negligence. End of case.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46048 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46052 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, it does say that in the blue brief. Because what we say is that the doctrine of equivalence is the principle that should apply. And you know, it is not specifically before the Court whether that means slight cause or proximate cause.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46053 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I would say it sure is before the Court, because what we are considering before the Court is your objection to instruction 13.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46054 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's fair.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46055 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You're going to say yes. So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether -- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole or in part.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46056 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I don't know that it's --

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46058 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't know that it's extraneous. It clearly is not something that the Court needs to decide. On the other hand, it is something that the Respondents, to my mind at least, put into the case. And then we responded, to be sure, somewhat aggressively in urging the Court to rethink whether Rogers was right -- Official whether Rogers really decided this issue as some courts of appeals have.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46059 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Perhaps my memory is faulty, but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were devoted to what instruction should have been given on railroad negligence. You were dealing not simply with what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it said -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language. Instead it said directly caused. So that's the limit of what we can deal with, whether the in whole or in part should have been in the contributory negligence. But it was your brief that spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for the railroad's negligence.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46060 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg. But the point is that we made both arguments. And they are in some ways intertwined, in part because so much of the doctrine of equivalence itself is based on proximate cause as the standard. And so if you go back and look at all of the common law analyses here, which are the predicate --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46061 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But you didn't object to the charge that was given on negligence. You didn't object to the in whole or in part. So that should be out of the Official case.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46062 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Except to the extent that the Respondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence. Now, it seems to me you can answer that in one of two ways. You can say simply, as I said to Justice Scalia, Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence, and therefore, you don't have to entertain that, you should just reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the courts in Missouri have recognized for a very long time. Or alternatively, you can say, well, look, they say that in order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence, you should examine whether or not Rogers worked a sea change in the law. And we took them up on that argument, and said, we don't think it did. And that if it didn't work a sea change in the law, then there is no basis at all for doubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in these two cases. And that's the guidance you would give to the lower courts on remand. Because this case would have to go back for a new trial.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46063 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You're not taking them up on any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about what the proper standard was for the railroad's Official negligence.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46064 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And I would add to that that we don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the Petitioner is presenting.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46065 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And you know, Justice Kennedy, I understand that. But the reality is we raised the doctrine of equivalence as our question presented. The other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its pages for the issue of the meaning of Rogers. We answer that in the reply brief. The Court grants certiorari. We decided under those circumstances that the sensible way to proceed was to address the Rogers issue. Now, to be sure, I suppose we could have said, here's -- section one is the doctrine of equivalence. That's a 10 page brief. Maybe the better way to do it is just write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief on Rogers, and then 20 pages on Rogers. But we anticipated that they were going to do precisely what they did, which is --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46066 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So you would have us announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence without saying which way it should be made equivalent? Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the employee's?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46067 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, because -- courts of appeals Official have been doing that for years. There have been a lot -- you know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower standard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight cause, then the defendant gets slight cause. So that's a ruling that's been rendered for years and years. Is that the most sensible way? I don't know. I think it would make sense for this Court to address the more fundamental issue of Rogers. Because I think it is an important issue that needs to be decided. I don't think the Court needs to decide it. I do think it has been thoroughly vetted for the Court on both sides, and it would certainly provide significant guidance to the lower courts.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46068 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this question. Assuming you're right on the doctrine of equivalence and you're wrong on proximate cause, for the moment. Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is perfectly clear there was no harmless error here.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46069 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46070 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It seemed to me that a possible interpretation of the record -- and I'd like you to comment of the record -- is that the jury either believed the one -- one truck driver or the other. And that the direct causation thing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of Official damages. And I was going to ask you to comment on that and to tell me whether during the argument of the case before the jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect, that he had -- the railroad has a much heavier burden of proving a causation than we do?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46071 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Let me take the first question first, and then I'll address the second one. There were three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the negligence of the railroad. Not just that the one driver drove the other driver off the side of the road. There was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given adequate safety instructions. And there's no way, given that this was a general verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that theory might line up with a causation theory, based on the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's arguments in this particular case. So it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said, and that's it. They were more theories in it. And you know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to Official me the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a harmless error determination. It is also a question of State law. It ought to be decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance in any event, I would think, rather than this Court trying to sort through the record. With respect to the argument at the close of the case, I don't remember any specific arguments that either side made with respect to the burdens, because the jury instructions were what they were. And I think each side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything wrong. And so that's basically the way that it was presented. But I think given the way the jury instructions played out, that there's no way at this time to unscramble that.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46072 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I think I'm seeing now, I think the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on it, but saying this: Look, we objected to the contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it couldn't be different from the direct instruction -- from the railroad instruction.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46095 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46096 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But it also does something else. And I don't think we disagree about that either. It specifically instructs the jury that multiple causation may be present. And if it is, if the defendant is at least one, the source of one of those causes under Rogers even slightly --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46097 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46098 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- that that will suffice. The problem I have with -- in a way with your response to Justice Breyer, and the problem that I have with the instruction that your side requested on contributory Official negligence is this: It seems to me that the in whole or in part language would be wrong on contributory negligence, or at least it would be very misleading, for the simple reason that you never get to contributory negligence unless you found the defendant was negligent in the first place.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46099 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46100 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And therefore, if the plaintiff is also negligent, it will necessarily be in part. It couldn't be wholly or in part. If it were wholly negligent, you would never have found the defendant was negligent in the first place.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46101 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46102 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So that to the extent the instruction addresses multiple causation, it would be misleading to the jury, and it would assume a possibility that couldn't happen. Therefore, if you are not going to mislead the jury on multiple causation when you instruct on contributory negligence, you've got to have some other way of addressing the proximate cause language. Is that analysis right or wrong?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46103 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think it is wrong on two levels. One is, I don't know why you would need to have proximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you just made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight Official cause, which is what Missouri thinks the in whole or in part means, then you can just say slight cause when you're describing the contributory negligence.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46104 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Okay. But the instruction that your side asked for, as I understand it, was not a slight cause instruction, it was an in whole or in part instruction.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46105 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What we asked for was an equivalence.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46106 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Okay, and that -- all right. But if you're asking for the in whole or in part instruction on contributory negligence, it seems to me the judge has got to have been correct in saying no to that, because to the extent that it addresses multiple causation, it would be addressing a problem that couldn't even occur in contributory negligence which will always be in part.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46107 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That was not the basis on which the judge rejected it. He didn't reject it on the basis --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46108 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, maybe that was not the basis on which he rejected it, but if -- we've got to consider it in deciding whether to reverse it.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46109 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the point here that remains is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction. Now, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly argue about that. Official
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46110 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But that's not what he said. He said equivalence instruction was not on multiple causation. It was the equivalence instruction on either proximate cause or not proximate cause. It was the causation issue, it was the proximate causation issue, not the multiple causation issue that concerned you, right?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46111 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that is the specific issue in this case.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46112 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # They don't have to have proximate, we don't have to have proximate.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46113 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. That's our argument.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46114 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Okay. But because the instruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause and multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far as the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory negligence really should have been denied. Is that correct?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46115 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well -- I think -- I think the argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly. I think you can make an argument that what, you know, what we were entitled to was some variant. And that -- our objection here is not --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46116 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You were entitled -- your Official argument is you were entitled to an equivalent instruction on the issue of the need to prove --

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46124 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And I don't think you could have gotten where you want to go with the instruction that your side requested, which was an in whole or in part instruction. That's my only point.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46125 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it may be that the in whole part of this may have been slightly misleading, although I think you can make an argument that you can end up with in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter. But that's not the -- that wasn't the complaint at trial. It wasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't the basis for the court of appeals decision. If the Court wants to send it back and say, is there another objection to this instruction, that's fine. But it seems to me, this Court ought to address this issue in the way it has been presented.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46134 # FALSE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The controlling question raised here is whether instruction 13 accurately states Federal law. That's exactly what petitioner said in their reply brief to the Missouri Court of Appeals. They could not have been any clearer that their challenge was to instruction 13. In John versus Poulin, this Court said that State courts Official have the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in their courts even when Federal issues are at stake. The requirements in the Missouri courts were not complied with here. No abstract question was presented. The sole question presented and preserved was with respect to instruction 13. And that can again be seen in their opening brief in the Missouri Court of Appeals, which specifically says the trial court erred in giving instruction 13 based on MAI 32.07(b).
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46135 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Is the question whether instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether it is flawed when it's viewed together with the instruction on employer negligence?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46136 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It is viewed in conjunction with the instruction on employer negligence, but a fixed concept of what it was, they did not challenge the language of instruction 12. They accepted that. Holding that language constant, what should we do to instruction 13? They could have objected to instruction 12 and 13, and they could have said, here are a pair of instructions both in proximate cause, and here are a pair of instructions both in -- resulting in whole or in part, and then they could have preserved this issue. But they did not do that. They accepted instruction 12 as a correct statement of the law, and said, now let's look at Official instruction 13.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46137 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But do you agree that they set out different causation standards, 12 and 13?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46138 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, they do. Rogers concluded that 50 years ago and the courts in the Federal and State system have nearly uniformly interpreted Rogers as reaching that decision.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46139 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So if the causation standards are in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't that right?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46140 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, if you can reach that decision without interpreting instruction 12, or the propriety of instruction 12, particularly since instruction 12 contained the exact language of the statute. Whatever judicial gloss has been put on that language was not told to the jury. Justice Stevens, the question you asked, whether there was any argument about the different standards, the answer is no. There was no argument. The only way in which the jury learned of this difference was in the language of the instruction. And instruction 12 --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46141 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Let me ask you this question, if I may. Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips. Is there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence? I understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's Official burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence. But that doesn't sound to me like any overriding doctrine of equivalence. It just says when they wrote the restatement, the rules were the same. Is there such a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46142 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There wasn't in the early 1900s for certain, Your Honor, because at that time, even petitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging. And if we look at the language of 53, it talks about the type of contributory negligence that used to be a bar. And that certainly was a type of contributory negligence that only arose with the traditional proximate cause. It certainly wasn't on the slightest cause standard.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46143 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, doesn't there have to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a comparative negligence regime? Because, you know, you talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing it to a certain degree. And if you're not dealing with apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the comparison.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46144 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor. You can conduct the comparison, and it happens all the time in cases where one party has committed intentional misconduct and Official another party has had negligent misconduct. The causation standards are different in that instance. There's a --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46145 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Right. But we're talking about comparative negligence here, where there's negligence on both sides. And I just don't know how you say one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using different causation standards.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46146 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the causation standard is used to decide what negligence you use in the balance and in the comparison. For example, if a party is negligent, but the negligence had no causative effect, that negligence falls out of the analysis.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46147 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yeah, but your example of other instances including having to compare a defendant who did the tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory negligence, that's not what we have here. We have here a difference in the causation. Intentional or non-intentional has nothing to do with causation. But once you say that there's a difference in the causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two. You cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using the same kind of a standard. I mean, let's assume that you find that the Official railroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the injury to some extent, but the defendant was directly contributory to it. What do I do? Do I add another 40 percent to his culpability because it was -- his causation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46148 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46149 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why not?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46150 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It just affects which negligence was in the balance. And --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46151 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, it doesn't. It certainly bears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it seems to me.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46152 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in responding -- going back to your question about intentional conduct, the petitioner's reply brief, in fact, states that a broader range of harms are considered proximately caused by intentional torts. So there is a different conception of proximate cause in that context. But in any event, their merits brief consistently argues for a proximate cause standard. In fact, it closes with that. And its criticism of instruction 13 in this case was precisely that it was a proximate cause standard. So if they are now before this Court asking for a proximate cause standard, they conceded that instruction 13 was a proximate cause standard, they in Official fact complained about it precisely because it was a proximate cause standard, that issue really isn't before this Court anymore.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46153 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You don't have any conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, because it's comparative negligence. It seems to me that necessarily implies in whole or in part. If you can reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in instruction 13?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46154 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think Justice Souter hit the nail on the head on that one, in that it does create confusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad worker is responsible for other parties' culpability as well. Moreover --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46155 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, no. I thought Justice Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's instruction might cause confusion because of it. But I don't see how adding it to both of them when you're dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily the case that partial negligence on either of their parts can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be confusing.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46156 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in -- Official
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46157 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You can answer it.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46159 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Answer the question, Justice Souter. Yes or no.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46160 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The point that I was trying to make about it being misleading is that if you use the in whole or in part language for a contributory negligence instruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking that at least there might be whole contributory negligence. There never will be. You don't get the contributory negligence unless you've already found the defendant was negligent, at least to some degree. Therefore, if the plaintiff is negligent, it can only be in part. That's all I was trying to say.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46161 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Under that scenario, then, what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the accident?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46162 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If petitioner had asked for an instruction that said directly contributed in part, the inclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any impact. It could still potentially mislead the jury, but they were seeking not just to add the words "resulting in whole or in part," but remove the word "directly" because it connoted proximate cause, and that they felt proximate Official cause was not the appropriate standard for contributory negligence, even though now that is the standard that they solely are seeking.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46163 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, two things you might comment on. First, the in whole or in part, you might take account of the fact that there are other negligent actors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury to the employee. Secondly, Section 53 does not contain the language in whole or in part.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46164 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Absolutely, Your Honor. It does not. In section --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46165 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that's what Justice Souter has identified, right? That's not because they're adopting different standards.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46166 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I disagree, Your Honor. I think it is because they are adopting different standards. The contributory negligence --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46167 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, you just told me, a good reason for not putting in whole or in part in instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the whole part doesn't make sense with contributory negligence. That's a good reason not to put it in Section 53 either.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46168 # TRUE # MR. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's one reason. But another reason Official is that it's a different standard. In Section 53, they're talking about contributory negligence that was a bar to liability. That type of contributory negligence was the kind that was more than -- it wasn't caused by slight causation. It required proximate cause. That was a pretty harsh result. And it certainly didn't arise in instances where the plaintiff had just had the slightest causal connection. And that certainly was the conclusion in Rogers.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46169 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, no, no. May I pick you up on that? Because there's a point at which you and I are disagreeing about Rogers. And in all candor, I think it's because you are ignoring one part of Rogers, and if I'm wrong, I want you to tell me. You quote the slightest bit language from Rogers on both page 26 and 33 of your brief. And you take that as being language that eliminates the proximate cause requirement. What you don't include in your quotation is the footnote in Justice Brennan's opinion following that slightest cause language. And the footnote was to a citation, the citation was to the Coray case. The opinion in Coray was written by Justice Douglas and -- I'm sorry, Justice Black. And in the very language that Justice Black used, he said expressly that if proximate Official cause is shown, there can be recovery. Now, given the fact that in Rogers, the very citation to the language which you say eliminated the proximate cause requirement cited a case in which proximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on, I don't see how you can read Rogers -- maybe later cases, but I don't see how you can read Rogers as eliminating the proximate cause requirement. And therefore, I think you have to read Rogers as addressing the issue of multiple causation, not proximate causation. Now, am I going wrong there somewhere?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46170 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I have two responses, Your Honor. First, Justice Brennan wrote Crane twelve years later.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46171 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Absolutely right.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46172 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And he, you know, definitely clearly said that a railroad worker does not have to prove common law proximate causation relying on Rogers.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46173 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # He did, but he was also pointing out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in Crane that the liability arose in Crane out of -- I forget the full name of it -- the Appliance Act. And the Appliance Act had its own set of standards. And therefore, you cannot, from an Appliance Act case, you cannot infer anything one way or the other about the general standard in FELA. And to make it even more Official complicated, as I recall, Rogers was an Appliance case, too, but he didn't get into that there. But my only point is, you are right about the two Brennan opinions, Rogers and the -- Crane. But given the fact that it was an Appliance case, I don't think you can infer one thing or another about an ultimate FELA standard in the absence of an Appliance action. What remains is that the citation in Rogers was to Coray, and Coray spoke about there still being proximate cause.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46174 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. But if we look at those earlier cases, particularly Coray, we can see that Rogers articulated what was meant by that proximate cause language. Proximate cause is, in a sense, a label for scope of liability or legal cause, as the restatement says. It doesn't have any singular conception. And in Coray, the Court found --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46175 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, it is understood by everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception which is captured by using the word "direct" as in instruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning whenever it is used, doesn't it? In other words, it may not have a lot of bells and whistles associated with it in the prior law, but at least it requires some direct causation as opposed to Official indirect, right?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46176 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46177 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. And that's -- I don't know that Justice Brennan's citation to Coray, or Coray's use of the language carries you any further than that. But that's as far as Mr. Phillips wants to go.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46178 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We don't accept that, but even if that's the case, the Rogers -- the parties to Rogers immediately interpreted that decision as affecting proximate cause. Twelve years later, this Court did say that in Crane. The lower courts have uniformly, nearly uniformly interpreted Rogers in a certain way. And at this point, stare decisis suggests that this Court should not overrule.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46179 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That may be. That may be. But it seems to me that that's a different argument from saying Rogers requires it, because I don't think you can get that out of Rogers.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46180 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, and I also think, though, that by lightening -- by saying the slightest cause possible or, you know, a slight cause would create liability, that does affect proximate cause.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46181 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You don't have to say that. I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to follow the words of the statute. And so whole or in part Official makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't appear in Section 53. Why don't we just -- why shouldn't the instruction just say, "such negligence of the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury." It's not going to be a complete bar because we know the immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing the award by the amount of the negligence. Why wouldn't that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46182 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because Section 53 refers to contributory negligence that created a bar. And that was the type of negligence that required proximate cause. Moreover, the type of instruction you are positing is not at all what petitioner requested in this case.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46183 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, no, but he requested that the instructions be the same, and the directly is what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in the statute.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46184 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But under Missouri procedures, you have to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the objection was that we want the same language, we want the language resulting in whole or in part. And out of respect for the State courts and their right to create the rules that govern in those courts, that was not satisfactory under Missouri rules. Missouri rules also have specific requirements for what you have Official to do in the court of appeals. There's a "Point Relied On" which is the argument heading in the brief, and it's required by Rule 84.04. And it sets forth a very specific format, and it's supposed to start with "The trial court erred in," and then you give your reasons. And it says that negligence -- it erred in instructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if it concluded that his negligence directly contributed to cause his injury, rather than cause his injury in whole or in part. You know, there is no issue that was preserved in the Missouri courts other than that challenge. Cook versus Caldwell which we cite in our brief, in Missouri, not only do you have to object, but you have to keep consistent with the basis of the objection. You can't just object to instruction 13 on one ground, go up to the court of appeals, and raise a completely different challenge to instruction 13. You have to stay consistent. And out of respect --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46185 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46186 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That was a justification for rewriting instruction 13 to include the words "resulting in whole or in part." I do not think they raised an abstract argument about equivalency; that in order to do that, Official they would have had to object to instruction 12 and instruction 13, because equivalency in the abstract would require modification of both instructions, and they clearly chose to accept the language of instruction 12 and only object to instruction 13. So no, not in the abstract, it hasn't been raised. It was a justification for one particular result, and that was a result that would have modified instruction 13. And in a particular way, too, modified it in a way of including the words "resulting in whole or in part."
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46187 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I guess they want to make the argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with contributory negligence. I don't see anything else. It doesn't speak of causation at all.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46189 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It just says if there's some contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished according to the negligence attributable to the employee. So I take it their argument was, maybe with hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language, because nothing requires it. And since, other things being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the same language you gave for the other side. And they said the judge rejected that argument, so Official now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have accepted it. And all the rest of what he's saying is just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something like that. But what about that one?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46190 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I'm sorry, Your Honor. Could you --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46191 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I mean, should we answer the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a causation instruction. The judge's causation instruction in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's causation instruction on contributory negligence, if there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the defendant's negligence. And he says that isn't what happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one of them was this equivalence thing. So he's saying to us: Decide it, say that they were wrong. What's your view of that?

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46197 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It was not, but they say, nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was wrong. One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of causation differently than when they spoke of causation in respect to the railroad. We thought that was a reason why it was wrong then.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46202 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But if the question goes to the fact that Section 53 doesn't have an express causation standard in it, what you fall back on is traditional proximate cause, that Congress departed from the traditional proximate cause standard by using the words Official "resulting in whole or in part" in Section 51. It didn't create the same departure in Section 53. In fact, by referring to the kind of contributory negligence that creates a bar, it was pretty much pointing right back to proximate cause.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46205 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Of course. So then how can "in whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause requirement, because it could be in part and still be a proximate cause. How can that language possibly be interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46206 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because when a cause that -- when a slightest cause can give rise to liability, that has effectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46207 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But it could be the slightest direct cause, which is Justice Scalia's point.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46208 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, but if we look at like the first --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46209 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now, it may mislead the jury if that's all you say. But as a matter of analyzing the statute or even of analyzing what the Court meant in Rogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that Official would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis; isn't that so?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46210 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, no. The Restatement, for example, at the time of Rogers talked about substantial factors, and talked, in other words --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46211 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # How can you say no when you acknowledge that the prior law when there was contributory negligence used to require proximate cause for both the negligence of the defendant and for the contributory negligence of the defendant? Such a situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't have to be the sole cause. It can be just the cause in part, right?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46212 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46213 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So the mere fact that we had contributory negligence statutes that were applying proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a proximate cause can be a cause in part.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46214 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor, but what Rogers and the statute recognizes that it can be a very, very slight cause. And what it was understood, for example, in the --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46215 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That's what Rogers might have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about slight cause. It only says in whole or in part. Official
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46216 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And neither did the instruction. It just used the words "resulting in whole or in part" also. But Rogers did interpret the language "resulting in whole or in part" as meaning playing any part, even the slightest. And that has been the law for 50 years. And it would be a massive change in the law, as Justice Scalia said earlier, for this Court to depart from that at this point in time.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46217 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It doesn't seem to me that slight is the opposite of proximate. It could be a slight proximate cause.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46218 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The Restatement at the time of Rogers talked about substantial factors, and in the comment to that, it explains that sometimes the other causes can be so predominant that one causation is just not sufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to constitute a legal cause. So there is a component of quantity within the concepts of proximate cause. I believe their reply brief talks about substantial factor, and to talk about something as being a substantial factor does have a quantum component to it, just as slight has a quantum component to it. A slight cause could not be a substantial factor, or oftentimes would not be a substantial factor. So the two really do go hand in Official glove.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46219 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But under the old rule that plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar to recovery?

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46224 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And clearly, Congress in this statute was trying to move away from the common law in many respects to protect the railroad worker. And the interpretation of Section 51 as lightening the causation standard for the defendant's negligence, but leaving intact the traditional proximate cause standard for plaintiff's contributory negligence completely comports with the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46225 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why isn't "in whole or in part" simply the logical corollary of introducing comparative negligence? Why do you have to read that as Official departing from proximate cause, instead of simply recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the employee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46226 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I reach that conclusion on the basis of Rogers. And in the petitioner's brief --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46227 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Beyond that, if the plaintiff's negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the -- there was no reason to get to comparative negligence or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there would have been no negligence by the defendant.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46228 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46229 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That's why you don't have "in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there, but because, as Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in whole or in part.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46230 # TRUE # MS. PERRY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Even the petitioner's brief describes the language "resulting in whole or in part" as an elaboration of proximate cause. They recognize that it has bearing on proximate cause. And so if it has bearing on proximate cause in Section 51, it certainly would have bearing on proximate cause if it was incorporated into the language of the instruction on contributory negligence. So that may be one reason for not including the Official language, but another reason is that it does affect the causation standard and Congress did not incorporate it in Section 53, whereas it did have it in Section 51. And when it modified the statute in 1939 for assumption of the risk, to abolish assumption of the risk, it did not equate proximate cause and "resulting in whole or in part" necessarily as the same thing because one version had proximate cause and it was not adopted. The phrase "resulting in whole or in part" was used in its place. So suggesting that Congress may, in fact, have seen a difference, just as Rogers concluded, and I think rightly so. Moreover, as I said, that has been the law for 50 years, and it's pretty settled in this country and it would create a massive change if this Court were to depart from that. Moreover, this is not the right case to decide that because the language in instruction 12 said, "resulting in whole or in part." And petitioner has never --
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46231 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It is not the kind of change anybody would have relied on, is it? I mean, I find it hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46233 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I find it hard to see any reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation.

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46243 # FALSE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd Official like to address just sort of two issues. One is the minimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about. It seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case is we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri standard which says that you cannot deviate from our designated instructions creates a disparity in the way you approach negligence and contributory negligence, that disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines, and nothing in FELA modifies it, and it's wrong. And that by itself warrants the case being set aside and a new jury being -- and a new trial. That's the simplest way to resolve the issue. If the Court wishes to go forward and deal with the issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the question is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do with this "in whole or in part" language. And if you go back -- you asked the question, Justice Souter, you know, what does the common law say. We cite this on page 38. If its negligence contributes proximately to the injury, no matter how slightly -- there must be a dozen cases that we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter how slightly. And they refer to "in whole or in part" as language that still recognizes that you still require proximate causation. The reality is nothing in Rogers remotely casts Official doubt on cases like Brady that say but-for causation is not enough, you have to have proximate causation, or Earnest, where this Court said that proximate causation is the correct jury instruction that has to be given. This Court said nothing about that in Rogers.
argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46244 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Would you have in your ideal instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury, that defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?

argument in Norfolk Southern Railway versus Sorre # 05-746 # 46248 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But in your model instruction, in your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in order to hold the defendant liable, you must find the defendant's negligence is the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45768 # FALSE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In these three cases, each of the three petitioners filed administrative grievances with the Michigan Department of Corrections. The Michigan Department of Corrections conducted investigations and issued final decisions on the merits of petitioner's grievances. Nevertheless, a year and a half later, each of the petitioner's complaints was thrown out of federal court without leave to amend because petitioners failed to satisfy on of the Sixth Circuit's judge-made corollaries to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. None of those three corollaries find any meaningful support in the Federal Rules of Procedure, in fact they contradict the federal rules. Nor do they find any support in administrative law or habeas law, the two areas of law to which this Court looks for guidance in interpreting administrative litigation and format. Finally, the overwhelming majority of the circuits that have considered these questions have rejected them all. I'd like to begin with the heightened pleading rule that the Sixth District applied here. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to simply provide a short claim statement of the basis on which his or her claim will lie. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do enumerate certain kinds of allegations that a plaintiff must plead with specificity, those are enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(c), but exhaustion is not one of them. Accordingly --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45769 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Suppose the district court finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that. And the district court said, the only way I can figure out the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite, an order for a more definite statement, because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think. Can the district court do that?

ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, first of all, when Congress created the various screening provisions in the PLRA, it noticeably omitted exhaustion.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45775 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # How about, what, if you concede the district court could do it in individual cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do it? That's my question.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45776 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, what sets the Sixth Circuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you propose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the prisoner, is given a chance to respond. In the Sixth Circuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial complaint, they are out. There is no leave to amend, and that's what happened in this case. In Petitioner Jones' case, he filed the complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies. He said: I exhausted my administrative remedies, I filed my step one grievance on this date, I received a denial on that date, and he went down the list through all three steps.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45777 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # The briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion.

ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # With respect to the form, I don't think that the form is improper, but I think it would be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoner's case if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of the form that asks him about exhaustion because exhaustion is an affirmative defense in both administrative law and habeas, and there's no indication in this statute that Congress --

ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We would certainly concede that if it is clear on the face of the complaint that a prisoner has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies then that claim can be dismissed. I guess the way it would operate -- and I haven't seen a case like this -- but it would be where a prisoner says, I didn't exhaust my administrative remedies and I have no excuse for failing to do so, but please, district court, please take mercy on me. And in that situation the district court could say, there's absolutely no way you can possibly prevail on the merits, so your claim --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45785 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Probably the reason they do this is that there are lots and lots of claims by prisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher. They don't know what it's about. They don't want to put the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single complaint when it's quite a good probability it's about nothing. That's the kind of reasoning that would lead to a rule like this. So -- and then you have the statute and the statute says indeed there's a special power here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't state a claim or malicious. So why isn't this just an exercise of the Sixth Circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary rulemaking powers? They're trying to figure out how to manage their docket.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45786 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The problem is that it conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8. And as this Court this repeatedly said, including as recently as last term in Hill v. McDonough, the Court will not impose a heightened pleading requirement absent an amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45787 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So your point would be that they can do this if we amend the Federal Rules. If it's a problem take it to the Rules Committee?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45788 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that's correct. I think that's correct, but if it --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45789 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If we amended the rules that way, in effect it would no longer be an affirmative defense. I mean, by definition an affirmative defense gets raised by the defendant and so on, so if we amended the Federal Rules in practical terms it would be like adding an element to the claim.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45790 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. Or if the Court were to add PLRA exhaustion to the Rule 9(c).
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45791 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But Rule 8 and the normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation under the PLRA where the district court has an affirmative obligation screen on its own before the defendant even gets involved. So if in fact, just to follow on Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of the cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a reasonable means of facilitating the screening obligation?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45792 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It may be a reasonable means, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's permissible, because Congress had exhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA and noticeably absent from all the PLRA screening provisions is the term "exhaustion."
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45793 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, but you just told me earlier that if it was a case in which exhaustion is required and not done that would be a frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous claims. So the district court or the Sixth Circuit has just said, we know that in a large number of cases they are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the exhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find out which those cases are to fulfill the screening obligation, which takes this out of the normal Rule 8 type of case.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45794 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, I think I understand. I think it goes back still to the fact that there's not a clear Congressional expression to take these cases out of the Federal Rules. In Califano v. Yamasaki we believe is instructive on that point. In in that case the Secretary of the Department of Health Education and Welfare had argued that Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, which used the term "individual," somehow took those, those judicial review procedures, out of the operation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. This Court said: No, we cannot read the word "individual" as such a clear expression. It may have been Congress's policy to have individual claims be addressed one by one, but you have to find that clear expression in the statute and that clear expression is not here.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45795 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, what about 1997(e) and (g), which prohibits, seems to prohibit a case from getting beyond the complaint, not even to the answer unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits. Doesn't this clearly take this out of the normal pleading procedures?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45796 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't think so, Justice Alito. We have exhaustively researched that language, the reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits 1997(g), and the only courts that construe that language are courts construing 1997(e) and (g), and they have universally found that that provision simply summarizes the other screening provisions' terms, so, frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim, or seeks -- from an immune defendant. And we can't really think of what, what else Congress would have had in mind because while it's like the preliminary injunction standard it makes no sense that Congress wanted a prisoner to satisfy a preliminary injunction standard before requiring prison officials to respond.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45797 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Would your answer be different if amendment were allowed? I mean isn't the problem in substance here, and I don't mean to dismiss your arguments from the rules, but leaving the argument from the text of the rules aside, it wouldn't be a real problem here in substance if the circuit bar allowed amendment, would it?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45798 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think if the circuit were to, Sixth Circuit were to allow amendment it would certainly mitigate the situation. It's our position that the screening provisions can't overrule Federal Rule of Procedure 15 either, but the problem we see with even doing away with the no amendment rule, but keeping in place the heightened pleading rule, is that we are talking about prisoners. Prisoners who don't have a lot of access to materials. They may have -- legal materials. They may have great difficulty holding on to their, their formally filed grievances.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45799 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Andre, didn't you have in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was spelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that alleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail. Then the answer attached every piece of paper that came up at all three levels of the grievance procedure, and then the plaintiff said oh, that's a good idea, I'm going to copy all those documents and make them my own. And nonetheless, that case was dismissed for failure to allege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the record made it plain that there had been exhaustion. The rule that you are opposing would operate that way. If you don't allege exhaustion in detail, it doesn't matter that the deficiency has been made up by the answer. You go out. Wasn't that the decision in one of these cases?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45800 # TRUE # MR. GRANT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. That was in Petitioner Jones's case, and that -- Petitioner Jones's case is a great example of how the heightened pleading rule and the no amendment rule work together to result in a prisoner being unable to cure any problem with his or her initial complaint.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45801 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You talk about the lack of statutory direction on the first two points but there is a very explicit statute on the third question. It says no action shall be brought until administrative remedies are exhausted. And yet you say the action should be allowed to be brought even if there are unexhausted claims in the complaint.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45802 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I -- we concede that an action that contains unexhausted claims or a mixed action shouldn't have been brought in the first place, but it's there. And the question then becomes what to do about it. And the language no action shall be brought; it's very common in administrative exhaustion schemes, the Americans with Disabilities Act uses almost identical language, the Immigration Nationality Act uses very similar language, Title VII --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45803 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # This is a very different statutory scheme. This is designed to address the problem of an overwhelming number of frivolous complaints that result in the fact that meritorious complaints can be overlooked. We've got a haystack in a needle problem here. And if you allow the action to continue, that doesn't do anything to reduce the number of filing of claims that as you say should not have been brought.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45804 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I guess I should be clear at the outset that we are by no means advocating that a prisoner can shoe horn in unexhausted claims with exhausted claims. So the unexhausted claims must go.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45805 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well right, but you provide under your approach no incentive for the prisoner to leave those claims out. Instead what, a screening function turns into an editing function. The district court is supposed to just excise out the unexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to continue.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45806 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it's been our experience and from reading the case law it appears that prisoners don't intentionally try to shoe horn in unexhausted claims with their exhausted claims. It's typically based on innocent mistake, a simple failure to understand either the particular circuit within which they are housed, a difficulty in understanding that circuit's exhaustion law, difficulty in understanding the prison grievance procedures that they attempted to comply with, and perhaps even being further confused by the fact that prison grievance administrators seem to apply prison grievance regulations, I don't want to say in an ad hoc manner, but inconsistently. And so when they bring these complaints that are mixed they actually are intending to bring a fully exhausted complaint but then after a little built of judicial review, it becomes clear that they didn't exhaust.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45807 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why does it hurt if you dismiss the whole thing? They could just refile.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45808 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it hurts for a couple of reasons. Well -- and -- it hurts under the Sixth Circuit's rule because they did not allow prisoners to amend. So --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45809 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No. No. What would happen is you just dismiss the complaint. So -- I guess again the reason they have these things is they get a certain number of complaints, they have no idea what it sys, to tell you the truth, they don't know what the claim is, they don't understand it, there are a lot of things written here; the person wasn't represented; it's hard to make out. And for, the judge thinks I have to go through all these papers; I have to figure out if there is something here that was exhausted, we know something happened; it was something exhausted -- so the simplest thing is just dismiss it. Now the prisoner can always refile it with the parts that he has to now figure out were exhausted. Now is -- and it doesn't hurt because, just refile it.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45812 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I guess there is two different versions of the total exhaustion rule as it's termed. There is the Eighth Circuit's rule with is with leave to amend. So the complaint is dismissed, and prisoner can file a new complaint without the unexhausted claims. Then there is the Sixth Circuit's rule, which is the most draconian of all the versions. And that says the entire action is dismissed, prisoner must institute a new action.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45814 # TRUE # MR.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45820 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If they get IFP status, all that means -- well, first of all, they only get to do that three times. Or to have three actions dismissed before they lose their IP status.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45821 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is that a draconian rule, do you think? You have to have three actions dismissed before you have to pay the filing fee?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45822 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, no, no. I mean -- but that's not really at issue in this case. But even if they qualify for IFP status they still have to pay the #350 filing fee. It's just taken out in installments.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45823 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I guess this is probably not a question for you, but a question for your friend on the other side.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45824 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that's exactly right, Justice Scalia.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45825 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No, well, the reason it would hurt is because it's difficult for the judge to go though this complaint that he can't quite make sense out of. And it puts the burden of the prisoner to go through and figure out what he really wants to say. That's why -- that's why it's easier for the judge just to dismiss it than to go through many, what could be many pages with a fine-toothed comb trying to figure out if there is anything here that was exhausted.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45826 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And the other incentive is if you adopt your rule, the incentive on the prisoner is to put in every possible claim, even if it is not exhausted because maybe it will get through, maybe it won't. And if it doesn't get through, no harm. He doesn't even have to pay another #50.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45827 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But I think at least, at least under that scenario, the district court still only has to take one look at the case and then it can move forward, it deletes the unexhausted claims. So from a judicial efficiency standpoint I think the Ortiz V. McBride rule out of the Second Circuit, which is the rule that we are advocating, is -- is the cleanest approach. It takes the choice away from the prisoner; it puts the choice with the district court, and it allows the district court to delete off any unexhausted claims. And in most instances --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45828 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is there any argument that if the state does not insist on exhaustion or plead exhaustion, that it just drops out of the case? If the state resolves the case on the merits even though there is no exhaustion, can the Federal court hear it, that there is general agreement about that?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45829 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think there is. The circuit -- the four circuits that we know were unanimous that PLRA exhaustion is not jurisdictional, and in Woodford we know this Court confirmed that. And so to the extent that the PLRA exhaustion is an affirmative defense, then it would operate like other exhaustion schemes in administrative -- administrative law, and habeas, where it is waivable by the other side.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45830 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If -- if we accept your first two arguments, then if there is no heightened pleading rule and you don't have to name the specific defendants in the administrative grievance that you end up naming in the complaint, if you prevail on both of those, then isn't the third question, have you, what happens when you haven't properly exhausted, is really not alive anymore in this case, because you will have properly exhausted. So why should the Court go on to answer what would happen if you hadn't properly exhausted?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45831 # TRUE # MR. GRANT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, it's unfortunately more complicated than that. If the first question in the Jones case, the ID pleading rule question, is resolved in favor of Petitioner Jones, then total exhaustion is a live issue. Because the Sixth Circuit as an alternative holding justified the dismissal of Jones's complaint on the total exhaustion ground. And I guess on the other side if the Court were to resolve the identifying the defendant's issue against Petitioner --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45832 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But the Sixth Circuit obviously would have been wrong; if he has totally exhausted; they have, gave that as a no alternative grounds, but if they are wrong on the first one and he has exhausted. That's the end of it.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45833 # TRUE # MR. GRANT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The Sixth Circuit -- and it's not really clear from this opinion, because it's an unpublished opinion, but the Sixth Circuit appears to have adopted the magistrate judge's finding which is based on respondent's motion to dismiss that Jones substantively, for lack of a better word, didn't exhaust all of his claims, so -- I'm sorry. I'm not being clear.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45834 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That was the case where the, where the defendant estate, wasn't that the case where they put in all the papers from the administrative record?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45835 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. But they also argued that Jones failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on everything but his First Amendment retaliation claim. Or what they termed his negative work --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45836 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes, but they were wrong about that. If, if there was exhaustion in the case, and if there is no rule that you must name everything the defendant that you end up suing, if those two are established, again wouldn't we be dealing with a moot question? Moot in this case?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45837 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I think in order for the total exhaustion issue to be moot, the heightened pleading requirement would have to be resolved against Petitioner Jones, and the naming the defendants issue would have to be resolved in favor of Williams and Walton. I charted out on a matrix and verified it a couple of times. Turning to the naming issue if I could, since we haven't addressed that, the Prison Litigation Reform Act simply sets a floor of how much specificity a prisoner must provide in his or her grievance. It does not require what the Sixth Circuit held here which is that as a matter of Federal statutory law a prisoner must have identified every individual who he or she later sues in Federal court. This is a kind of endemic, or flows logically from the Court's decision in Woodford V. Ngo. Woodford v. Ngo says that prisoners must comply with grievance procedures.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45845 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, right. I think really the question is an X or not X question. It's does the PLRA as a matter of statutory law required individuals to be named in the underlying grievances, and the PLRA is entirely silent on that question, and this Court's decision in Sims v. Apfel lends further lends further support to the proposition that a Federal court cannot go beyond what the particular administrative agency's rules require. I realize that was a plurality decision but I think the petitioners win under either the plurality opinion or under Justice O'Connor's concurrence. And so yes, Justice Scalia we agree with you that it's simply an X or Y question that down the road perhaps the Court could address the scenario where a prison system amends its rules to require individual defendants to be named and then perhaps a prisoner can't comply with that based on the short previous filing deadlines, and then there is a question of whether the administrative remedies were actually ever available to that particular prisoner.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45846 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And you have in one of these cases, the person has said: I didn't know who was the person who said I couldn't have the operation until the prison identified him.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45847 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct. I believe you're referring to either the Williams or the Walker --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45848 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes. So even if you had a rule, a reasonable rule, that named the people that you know, if you have it, that would not encompass someone? In two of these cases, the defendants -- the plaintiff, the prisoner, said, I didn't know who those guys were until they were identified.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45849 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. And to that extent the prison grievance system worked, because the prisoners provided as much detail as they possibly could and then the prison grievance system went out, conducted its investigation, broadened the universe of relevant facts, and then made a determination. They happened to determine that grievances were not meritorious. Obviously, petitioners disagree with that assessment. That's why they sued in Federal court. But the prison grievance system worked. To borrow from the Third Circuit's decision in Spur v. Gillis, a cooperative ethos between inmate and jailer was achieved, because so long as the prisoner provides sufficient information for the grievance system to go out and answer any unresolved questions and so long as the prison grievance system avails itself of that opportunity then the claim is exhausted. If there are no further questions, I'd like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act to deal with the flood of prisoner litigation that was coming into the Federal courts, obscuring the treatment for meritorious claims brought by all litigants. The purpose of the act was to unburden the courts from dealing with this flood of litigation that largely was without merit. The purposes for the act were to increase the quality of the litigation, decrease the quantity of the litigation, allow the states to address first the issues that the prisoners have problems with and to develop an administrative record to facilitate judicial screening. And all of this would result in increased judicial resources for all litigation that has potential merit. The invigorated exhaustion requirement does require total exhaustion.

Why not go to the Rules Committee if this really is a burden and so forth, rather than doing something unusual, which is to make exhaustion something other than an affirmative defense, to dismiss the whole complaint, which appear to be rules that reached draconian results in a few cases anyway.

OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # This Court in Neitzke versus Williams took a look at the previous version of the in forma pauperis statute and that statute allowed sua sponte dismissals for only two reasons, frivolous and malicious cases. Under that, in that opinion, the Court indicated that when it's a sua sponte review for those two issues you don't get the benefit of the adversary process that's embodied in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Congress, recognizing that even in Neitzke the Court indicated that the Federal courts were being flooded with prison litigation, much of it meritless, expanded the categories that are now subject to sua sponte dismissal, and those include suing someone who is immune from liability or failing to state a claim.

Why, why would we say, depart from the normal rule that makes exhaustion an affirmative defense when we know that the party best equipped to provide the information about exhaustion is the prison, as the Jones case showed so well? They, the prison, had all of the grievances. They had all of the responses and they presented that to the court. So the prisoner is less well equipped to attach those papers than the prison is, so why isn't it not only traditional to have exhaustion as an affirmative defense, but makes the most sense because the one most likely to have the information is the prison?

Do you have any, even a single example of the many other instances where that language is used in the Federal statutes? And there are many of them. Do you know any other case where it's been interpreted that way, so that claims that are perfectly valid will not be retained, but rather the whole action will be dismissed?

It all serves the purpose that Congress intended, which was to allow the courts to quickly screen these cases.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45894 # TRUE # MS. OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There is -- I believe it's under the exhaustion requirement.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45895 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And that's not -- the statute doesn't settle that. Our decisions settle that, right? So why should we deal with that, the two, any differently? It's not as though Congress wrote the statute differently. We said you can't proceed with unexhausted claims, so you have a choice. Either you go out of the Federal court and exhaust everything -- or even you don't have to go out; you could use the stay in abeyance -- or you just lob off the unexhausted claims, stay in the Federal court on the ones that you have exhausted. That's all made up by this Court. So why should the Court react differently in the PLRA than it did? Why should it fill those gaps differently than it did in habeas?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45896 # TRUE # MS. OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think because Congress did revoke the stay in abeyance provision in the PLRA.

So in that respect --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45913 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # One reason to require total exhaustion is because, I would assume the prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are exhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward with litigation. But I guess that's only true if the exhausted claims are still alive, and how many, when we're talking about unexhausted claims, are those typically claims that are not going to be available or are they claims that may generate relief once there is exhaustion?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45914 # TRUE # MS. OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It could be -- I mean, it's obviously both.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45915 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And then sometimes it's impossible to complete the exhaustion. I assume in some cases that the time limit for the last appeal will have expired, right?

OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That can also be the case, and under Woodford versus Ngo, now that they have to do proper exhaustion, there will be more of those cases where it probably, there wouldn't be anything left to do after it's dismissed except for the plaintiff to be the one to go through the maybe 20 claimed complaints and call out the claims that are not exhausted, rather than putting that burden on the court, which is contrary to Congress's purpose, to streamline this system.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45917 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # May I ask you about, there's another question you haven't really touched on yet, the requirement that the prisoner name every defendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting, in the internal procedure. I'd just like a little help on just exactly what happens. The prisoner doesn't get the kind of medical care he thinks he's entitled to, and he only knows it because either the low level person says no, the doctors said you can't have it. And he brings a proceeding, an informal administrative proceeding, and they deny relief. And then later on when he wants to sue, his lawyer happens to find out the name of the doctor who was involved, and there are several levels of authority making the decision. Does he have to start all over again to name those people, or what does he do?
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45918 # TRUE # MS. OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Medical care is -- well, for one thing, prisoners do have counselors, and so if they're not sure who is responsible for something, that's one of the things that they're supposed to do is talk to their counselor to find out. You know, I'm having this problem, I'm not getting surgery, why am I not getting surgery, who do I talk to, who do I complain to. So that's one way to resolve the problem.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45919 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And what if he does talk to the prison guard and the guard says I don't know, I don't know who's responsible for that decision, that's in the warden's office, or something like that.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45920 # TRUE # MS. OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If the prisoner makes inquiry and just simply can't find out who it is, then he should state that in his grievance and indicate that somebody in the medical department is denying me the surgery. You know, I talked to Dr. So and So, he's recommended that I get it, somebody is saying no, I haven't been able to find out who that is. And likely during the grievance process, he will find out who it is, because one of the responses will probably say that.

One of his grievances is nobody told me. Is he out of luck there? And I think there may well be situations in which prisoners don't have complete access to all the facts that go into a decision denying them medical care, for example, or say a prisoner has a religious problem and can't get the diet he wants, or something like that. But before he can sue, under your view if I understand it, he has to find out so he can name the people in his administrative complaint.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45922 # TRUE # MS. OLIVIERI # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # He has to make a good faith attempt to find out.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45924 # TRUE # MS.

It doesn't make any difference. The prisoner is denied his rights. As Justice Stevens said, there may be three or four different people who concurred.

And for whatever reason in the course of the response perhaps, he learned that not only was Dr. X involved but Dr. Y was involved in that decision. So if he is denied relief at stage two, he says X and Y, and he identifies X and why all the way through. He gets nothing satisfactory to him, so he goes in to Federal court.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45981 # FALSE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Ginsburg, you asked earlier about who is better equipped to plead and show exhaustion. It's certainly our position that the Michigan Department of Corrections or prison grievance administrators are absolutely better equipped to do so.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45982 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # How is that? The prisoner is the one who presumably knows best whether or not he filed a grievance or not.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45983 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The prisoner may know best whether or not he or she filed a grievance and whether or not he appealed. The prisoner may not know precise dates on which he or she did so or have copies of the grievances anymore. This really kind of brings the heightened pleading rule, not just whether it's just affirmative defense or a general pleading rule, to the fore. Prisoners are prisoners. They get moved around, they get put in administrative segregation; they are subject to repeat searches; they have great difficulty in maintaining possession of their belongings. On the other hand the Michigan Department of Corrections keeps copies of all the grievances, denials and appeals.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45984 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # This seems to me to be a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many prisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better position to know in individual cases, an individual prisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with respect to the grievance process. Surely the prisoner is in the best position. He knows what he did or at least what he is going to allege.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45985 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # He may be able to aver generally but with specificity there are many cases in which he won't be able to. But the Michigan Department of Corrections' policy directive makes clear that it has to maintain these records for future FOIA requests, and in many institutions it has to track them in a computer. And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in the Jones case, they were quite able to bring forward the proof of exhaustion that would satisfy, that would have satisfied the court that Jones had exhausted his administrative remedies. Jones gets, just got thrown out of court, essentially, in a game of "gotcha," because he hadn't attached his complaint in the first instance. I think most importantly, from a judicial efficiency standpoint, making exhaustion an affirmative defense makes sense. That means that the lawyers in the state attorney's general, in the state, in the office of the state's attorneys general, are going to be able to put forward the best arguments as to why a claim is or is not exhausted.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45986 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It requires, it requires response in all the cases, and as this subsection G indicates, part of the purpose of the act was to eliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous complaints. Why -- why, you know, you have to go through the requesting a response from the government, when in fact there is nothing to this complaint because there has never been any exhaustion.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45987 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But to go back to Justice Ginsburg's point earlier Congress could have included unexhausted claims among those types of claims that the court could screen out and dismiss or among those claims for which a court could --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45988 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's a different argument. But I mean, don't tell me that it isn't more efficient to have the prisoner say at the outset whether it's exhausted or not. It certainly is.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45989 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Or again, it may be more efficient to have them aver generally, but as far as having a prisoner comply with a heightened pleading requirement, we don't think that that makes sense.

argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45996 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I thought your main argument before was they invented this requirement without any basis, but now it's an actual requirement in the grievance procedure.
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45997 # TRUE # MR. ANDRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, but it wasn't when these claims were decided. And that's where I think Sims v. Apfel comes into play. Under Justice Thomas' plurality opinion, the key is looking at kind of the nature of the proceedings and if it's informal and accusatorial as opposed to adversarial, then a court cannot impose a requirement beyond that which the agency itself required at the time that the claims were before the agency. Under Justice O'Connor's concurrence, she was concerned about fair notice, and certainly here in these cases petitioners Williams and Walton didn't have fair notice that a year and a half later the State of Michigan, after going through the entire grievance procedure and never relying on their failure to be sufficiently specific, can then come into Federal court and say, aha --
argument in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton # 05-7058 # 45998 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Future prisoners now do have fair notice because the grievance procedure says name the individuals, dates, names, places, names of all those all involved.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45532 # FALSE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the parties agree that Federal courts, including this Court, have addressed nonstatutory defenses for almost 200 years and that Congress, in enacting criminal law statutes, legislate against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law, such that a defense of duress was likely contemplated by Congress when it passed the gun control statutes. It is, therefore, required that courts apply defenses, such as the duress defense, based on the background principle of construction that the prosecution must prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. The Government would have this Court discount the development of over 110 years of common law that has produced a substantial, well-established, well-reasoned majority rule in both State and in Federal courts that places the burden on the Government to disprove the absence of duress once that defense has been raised by the evidence. The development of the majority rule began with this Court's decision in Davis v. United States in 1895.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45533 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Mr. Jett, do I take it, from what you've just said, that you are recognizing this is a question of Federal common law and not due process, so that if Congress placed the burden on the defendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity? You're just arguing that this is the Federal common law?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45534 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Our -- our first issue and our first contention is that Federal common law will govern the decision in this particular case, but we also have a due process point that we also believe is germane. But --
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45535 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # You -- you -- then you think that Congress could not say that the defendant has the burden on the question of duress.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45536 # TRUE # MR.

Ohio, Your Honor, and we think that -- that based on recent precedents, Martin v. Ohio should be reconsidered. The -- the significant issue is that duress is based on the fact that there -- that there must be free will, and if free will is dispensed with, in this case by duress, then the -- the defendant doesn't have the requisite criminal intent. And -- and in our -- and since the beginning of -- since before the beginning of common law in -- in our system, it has been recognized that in order to have a criminal -- a crime, there have to be two things: one, a vicious will and the other an act -- an evil act concurrent with the vicious will. And --
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45539 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, there may be -- there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an intent element, but there may be other crimes where it wouldn't. And -- and I don't understand your argument to be -- is it that in every case duress negates an element of the crime or only in some cases?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45540 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we think that in -- that in every criminal case, with possibly the exception of -- of public welfare cases, that -- that there is an underlying background construction for our criminal law, which requires the Government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt criminal intent.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45541 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Which is the easier of the two cases for the defendant? A, the case where the argument is a burden of proof should be on -- on the -- the State as a due process matter or a common law matter in an insanity defense and, B, in a duress defense?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45542 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Which is easier for the State?

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45544 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we -- we contend that in a -- a -- duress is -- is different. Insanity deals with really the internal workings of somebody's mind, so that's perhaps more difficult for the State. But in a -- in a duress case, you're dealing not only with the internal workings but also external factors as well -- as well that impose somebody else's will upon the defendant.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45545 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I would think that it's easier in -- you know, we had -- we had a -- this term another case in which the argument is that you cannot have a separate insanity defense essentially and -- and exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the -- the lack of -- of mental capacity to -- to have that mens rea. This is the same thing you're arguing before us. And -- and it seems to me that if it applies to duress, it applies even -- even more strongly to -- to insanity. How can an insane person form the intent to commit a crime that -- that requires mens rea?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45546 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we -- we agree that -- I agree -- we agree that an insane person cannot form that particular intent. We think that they are similar except that the duress case is perhaps easier for the -- for the defense because we have external factors that often bear on what the defense is unlike --
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45547 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But -- but we've held, at least under the M'Naghten version of the defense, that the State -- that the burden can be put on the defendant to show that he was not insane under the M'Naghten test.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45550 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, our -- our -- we think that they're -- that they're similar because both deal with -- with the mental state, and -- and then historically, at least since -- since 1895 in this Court, this Court has said that you've got to have the vicious will in order to constitute a crime. And so you have the same issue here. Did Mrs. Dixon have the vicious will or was she acting under the will of someone else?

JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But the difference is, as you pointed out, Justice Souter, that the defendant is not acting of her own free will. She's -- she's acting based on the will of someone else, that that person has overborne her will.

But to say that it's not your choice, which is what you're arguing here, the only question is whether that has to be brought forward by reason of -- of a defense of -- of coercion or rather, whether it goes to whether you had the intent. That's all we're talking about here. And it seems to me you have the intent to yield to -- to the demand of whoever has the gun at the head of your children. It's a separate question whether the law should punish your yielding like that.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45574 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What -- what we're saying and what I think that this Court -- the precedents of this Court have said is that you have to have criminal intent. That is the vicious will that -- that the Court -- Justice Harlan talked about in Davis and this Court has talked about in Morissette.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45575 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, what is the statutory -- what is the mens rea under the statute for the offenses that the defendant was charged with? It's knowingly, isn't it?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45576 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, on -- on seven or eight of the counts, it's knowingly. Well, actually on the first count it's knowingly, but that is defined as -- as -- in this case, it was defined as voluntarily and intentionally. And then in the other counts, it was simply defined as knowingly. And so, indeed, that -- that's -- that is what the Congress said. However, based on the -- the precedents of this Court, that even when there is a knowingly culpable mental state provided by Congress, this Court has impart -- imported the -- the criminal intent to -- into the statute. And so like in -- for instance, in Morissette, which was a theft case, what this Court did was the Congress had said knowingly didn't provide a -- a criminal intent. So this Court imported one and said that the Court -- that the Government had to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt. Once the defense was raised, it became an element that the Government has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45577 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, counsel, under your view, how -- how is the Government supposed to prove a negative in every case? How are they supposed to prove the absence of duress?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45578 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It's really no different than any other case, Mr. Chief Justice. In -- in any case, for instance, a self-defense case, the Government has got to prove that -- disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt once it's raised. They do it in the same way they do in the other case.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45579 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But that's something that -- but self-defense is something that's often a -- a factual element that you can discern from the circumstances of the crime. The -- the other guy had a gun, you know, that sort of thing. So if it's going to be presented -- so it's something that's within the control of either side. Duress is something that in this case the Government would have no reason to suppose that it was even implicated until it's raised, and then they have no way of getting at what the particulars are because they're all within the control of the defendant.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45580 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we -- we would respectfully disagree with that. And this case is a very good example of -- of that -- of that circumstance. The Government -- early on in this case, they searched Mrs. Dixon's apartment and found evidence. They -- they interviewed her. They actually interviewed the abusers prior to trial before we gave them notice. They -- they were able to investigate her background partially before we gave notice, partially afterwards, so that they were able to -- to investigate her and circumstances of her life. But not only that, they were able to call as witnesses the seven gun dealers from which the guns were purchased who witnessed the purchase and who did provide testimony that she did not appear to be under duress, and they so testified. So in this particular case, it's really just like any other cases. You can certainly imagine a circumstance where that would be hard, but in very many cases, the facts are there just like a self-defense case or, for that matter, just like --
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45581 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But I thought the gist of her duress defense was not that she was under duress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she had reason to believe that her children were being threatened by accomplices or associates of -- of this -- this individual. And there's nothing in the facts of the -- the scene that would lead the Government to have any access to that evidence.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45582 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, what -- what she was in duress about is she was told at the time that there was somebody at home with a gun who was just a cell phone call away. So as far as she was concerned, there was somebody there with a gun to the head of her children and she was in fear of her children's life. In terms of what -- what the Government knew in this particular case, the Government had notice. The trial judge required that we provide notice of a defense. The trial judge required that if we -- said that if we had an expert, we had to give the Government notice of the expert and the subject matter of the testimony of the expert. So the Government was very well informed prior to trial what the defense was so that they hired their own expert who actually was able to interview the -- the accused without me being there and -- and so was prepared to testify about the issues of duress.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45583 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What -- what is the threshold test that the defendant has to cross before the judge will give the instruction to the jury? Obviously, the burden of production is with the defendant. When can a judge say, well, you know, this -- this is just too flimsy for a duress defense? I'm not going to instruct a jury on that.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45584 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the -- the first thing the judge would have to determine is that has -- has there been evidence of each of the elements of duress, and the trial judge found that we -- we've produced evidence of each of the elements of the duress. The -- in -- in the circuit court cases, they've not been consistent, but we would -- we would suggest that the -- the standard would be that there would be sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, that would raise a reasonable doubt with a rationale jury, sort of the -- the other side of -- of the prosecution's burden that they have to reach in order to get to the jury.

United States # 05-7053 # 45585 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What is the -- the methodology that you think we should follow in determining where the burden should be allocated under any particular criminal statute? Is it the -- the majority rule at the time when that particular statute was enacted or at -- is it -- you don't think it's the -- the old common law rule. What -- what is the -- at what point of time do we look at the -- at what's going on throughout our country?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45586 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think you've got to look at two points in time. And certainly we agree. We don't look at the old common law because -- because there's been 110 years of -- of development of common law in this country since Davis v. United States. So I think the Court has got to look at -- at what the common law was at the time that the relevant statute was passed, which in this case was 1968. But I think in addition to that, there -- there have been amendments to the statute.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45587 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So the burden would be different under different statutes?

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45590 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, because I think the -- I think you have to consider that. But the other thing you'd have to consider is the development of the common law since that time and what -- what courts have done, what the rationale has been that they have employed over time. And in this particular case, for instance, we have -- we have six Federal circuits and 29 States who have found that the burden of proof -- the burden of production should be on the defendant, but the burden of persuasion should be on -- on the Government to disprove duress once it's raised.

I'm -- I'm not sure, even if I agreed with your theory, that -- that what the Constitution requires changes on the basis of an evolving common law. Of course, it can only change in one direction. Right? It can only change favorably to -- to your client, favorably to the defendant. It can't change to be more harsh to the defendant because the Constitution prohibits that.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45605 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Mr. Jett, there's one piece of this picture that's different -- that distinguishes duress from, say, self-defense. If it's self-defense, you take a snapshot on the scene. You know exactly what happened. No one taking a picture of these gun purchases would have any idea of all of this. And the judge, when asked to give -- to allow the defense of duress, said, it's frankly a close call in my mind, but when it is a close call, better give it than not. Now, he thought that the defendant would have the burden of proof. Perhaps the judge would call that close question the other way if he thought he was saddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of persuasion.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45606 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In my mind it would be -- if it's a close question, I don't think the burden of proof in that particular circumstance would make a difference because it still is -- because he would then be taking it away from the jury. And in my experience, judges are -- are not want to take the questions away from the jury, and they will provide the -- the jury instruction in a close case. And that would be the right thing to do because ultimately we want the jury to make that decision. But the -- but the judge does have a gatekeeping function in -- in a duress defense, so that a judge -- in any circumstance, if the judge decided that the evidence was insufficient to get to the jury, the judge can make that determination so that you have the trial court acting with the -- the -- to make sure that what the jury is going to hear is -- is an issue for which there is evidence. So I think that the gatekeeping function that the trial court would -- would prevent there from being -- juries making a decision on insufficient facts.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45607 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Mr. Jett, a thought occurred to me, by reason of your agreement, that -- that it's a one-way ratchet, that when the common law changes in the -- in the direction of favoring the defendant, it becomes the duty of the courts to allow that. But, of course, it can't change in the other direction because the Constitution would prevent it. You sort of agreed with that. But -- but if -- if you agree with that, how can you explain our -- our 1895 decision in Davis which held that the insanity defense had to be proved by the Government which was then overridden by a Federal statute. How could -- how could -- if -- if Davis was right about what the -- what the common law required, how could Congress possibly have changed that by a statute? I would assume that all of the basic elements of the common law are picked up in the Due Process Clause. Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't the necessity of -- of proving the mental element of a -- of a crime, even when that mental element is overcome by insanity, why wouldn't that have been embodied in the Due Process Clause so that the congressional statute would have been ineffective?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45608 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, two reasons. One, Davis was a common law case, and -- and subsequently in Leland v. Oregon, this Court said Davis was a common law case. And so this Court can decide the common law issue with respect to the Constitution.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45609 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No. I'm not questioning whether we could do it. I'm questioning whether Congress could do it, whether Congress could overrule what we did in Davis. If Davis said that common law was that the Government has to prove -- disprove insanity, wouldn't that have been part -- become part of the Due Process Clause if it was the common law?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45610 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think -- I think that if it -- if it does become part of the Due Process, then obviously Congress cannot overrule it.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45614 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the thing about Davis that even though the -- the insanity holding about Davis was overruled, the core holdings of Davis was not overruled. And one of the things that Davis said was that, again, to constitute a crime against human laws, there must be the vicious will and, secondly, the unlawful act. The other thing that Davis said, which was very significant, is that the plea of not guilty is not like in a civil case where there's confession and avoidance. What it does is it negates or it controverts all of the allegations of -- of the State, and so that it controverts the existence of each fact that the State has to prove. If it -- if it, indeed, does that and what duress does is it negates the evil -- the evil intent, then -- then the Government has got to prove that there's criminal intent. It's got to negate one of the elements that the Government has got to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. And that's -- that -- that's part of the holding of Davis, and the Congress has not affected that with its decision on the insanity defense.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45615 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # May I ask, if -- if you know, whether Congress has ever been asked to address this precise issue that we're debating today?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45616 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Congress has -- has never ruled on the duress defense. I think a few years ago, there -- there was a proposal to -- to amend the Federal Criminal Code, and in that particular -- it didn't pass but I think the result of that was that Congress just took out the duress provision and said that the courts should make the decision as to how that would be handled based on -- on all the -- the normal considerations that a court looks at in making those decisions. So that the Congress has had many opportunities to rule on duress. The Congress -- just like the Congress has said you have to have notice of alibi and just like they passed the -- this -- the rule about -- I mean, the statute about insanity. The Congress could have -- have abolished the duress defense. I don't think they could have constitutionally, but they could have passed a statute and spoken to that, but they've chosen not to. And I think what that tells us is that the Congress is probably aware of the common law and have chosen not to interfere with the development of the common law in this country.

GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For three reasons, the burden of proving duress should be on the defendant, and the Government should not be required to disprove duress beyond a reasonable doubt. First, duress is an affirmative defense that excuses what would otherwise be serious criminal conduct. When the Government proves that a defendant has engaged in criminal conduct and has done so with the mens rea specified by the crime, it is fair to require the defendant to prove that duress excuses that criminal conduct, so that here, the Government proved that Petitioner knew she was lying when she filled out the forms and that she knew it was unlawful for her to receive firearms.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45639 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right. In -- in that kind of situation, the facts that go to duress could also go to undermining the proof of the motive in that case, and in that situation, the Government always has to prove the element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. But if the defendant wants to add to that a duress -- a specific duress defense, then the burden of proof would be on the defendant to prove duress. Now, normally in that --

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45645 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The Government's position is that on self-defense, the burden of proof is on the defendant, but it recognizes that there are important distinctions between self-defense and duress that could allow the court to reach different conclusions about the two defenses. In addition to the point that's already been made about the degree of factual overlap between self-defense on the one hand and duress on the other on the basic crime, there are three additional considerations. One is that the -- the circuits and the States are virtually uniform on self-defense, whereas there is a significant division of authority on the question of duress. Second, self-defense has always been a more favored defense because when the defendant acts legitimately in self-defense, he's not harming an innocent person. But when a defendant is actually under -- acting under duress, that defendant is still endangering or harming innocent third parties. And the third reason is that there's always been a significant degree of judicial skepticism about claims of duress, but there's never been that same kind of judicial skepticism about self-defense. So while we do take the position that the burden of proof is still on the defendant, the Court could take a different view on that issue and agree with us on duress.

Davis took the position that the common law had evolved to the point where on the specific defense of insanity, that this was the result that should follow, that there should be a burden of production on the defendant, and then the Government should have to disprove insanity beyond a reasonable doubt.

And that was also true at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The burden of proof was on the defendant. There was some evolution after that. Now, the -- the other thing I wanted to talk about with respect to Davis is it was based on the understanding that the Court had about the relationship between the insanity defense on the one hand and the mens rea element of the crime on the other hand. And here, there's simply no corresponding overlap. Whether or not the Petitioner acted under duress, she knew she was lying when she filled out the forms, and she knew it was unlawful for her to purchase firearms. So there's simply no relationship between the duress defense and the mens rea element of these crimes. Congress has also overruled Davis by statute, and we don't think it would be appropriate for the Court to extend Davis to a new defense when Congress has rejected it with respect to the only defense that it applied to. And -- and there's -- and certainly Congress acted constitutionally in overruling the Davis decision under this Court's decision in Leland and in other cases like Martin and Patterson, which say that there is no constitutional problem in putting the burden of proof on the defendant for established common law affirmative defenses.

And -- and yet, I take it, it's -- it's assumed that so far as the entrapment defense is concerned, the burden is on the Government. So if the burden is on the Government in what is a -- a somewhat difficult issue for the Government to carry the burden on in entrapment, wouldn't coherence suggest that a fortiori it ought to be on -- on duress?
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45661 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, and here's the reason. The -- the burden of proof on entrapment is actually on the defendant initially.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45664 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You mean the burden of persuasion.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45665 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Burden of persuasion on the element of inducement is on the defendant. The defendant has to prove more likely than not that the Government induced this crime in the sense that it took actions that are likely to override what a innocent person would have done. At that point, the burden shifts to the Government to show that this particular defendant was predisposed. Now, that's consistent with background common law principles under which, once it's shown that one party has been engaging in wrongful conduct, i.e., inducement, then the burden shifts to the wrongdoer to show that its conduct did not have its likely effect in that case. And that's why the Government then has to come back and show that with respect to this particular individual, that particular individual was predisposed, even though we took wrongful actions that would have induced an innocent person to do this.

GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That -- that's true, but again, if it was just a matter of who has access to the relevant evidence, then that would -- the burden should have been on the defendant, that it wasn't just a matter of that. There was this other principle which is that the -- there was already a showing -- there's already a showing that the Government has taken wrongful action to induce the crime. And that's why the burden shifts to the defendant -- to the Government to show that this particular person wasn't predisposed.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45671 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It -- there is nothing that I can point you to that shows there is an empirically evidence that the Government is not going to be able to deal with this burden. But what I would say to you is that you should take the same approach that the Court took in The Diana case many years ago, which is it did not want to establish a regime that invites manufactured claims.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45672 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, why is this worse in that respect? And lots of things in the case that you have to prove may be hard to prove because it requires finding out what someone said to the defendant over the telephone, what happened 4 years ago in a room where the defendant was the only one now alive present. There are lots of cases like that. Traditionally in the law, I take it, it's been that most instances where the defendant excuses his conduct on the ground he wasn't morally culpable, mistake, accident, self-defense. Entrapment? Not -- that's a different kind of ground. This one? Evidence mixed. But you have to prove lots of things where it's really in the hands of the defendant, and the defendant saying I'm so innocent because I'm not morally culpable. I was asleep. I was -- you know, we can imagine. So I don't see why this is different.

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45675 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Let -- let me start with -- I go back to The Diana case because I think the way the Court approached the question in The Diana case is the way this Court should approach it because it dealt with the same kind of defense, necessity. And what it wanted -- it said this is a defense where there is a there is a big danger that this can be manufactured in a way that it is difficult to disprove, and we are going to establish a regime that doesn't invite manufactured claims and that doesn't make it difficult for the Government to disprove something beyond a reasonable doubt. We have a choice here, and that's not the regime we want to establish. We want to establish a regime that makes it more unlikely that manufactured claims are going to come forward and that make it -- makes it more unlikely that if such claims do come forward, the Government isn't going to be able -- unable to disprove them beyond a reasonable doubt, compromising the entire statutory scheme.
argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45676 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But if we're thinking of things logically, logically you're right. I can see that this is in the hands of the defendant. But I've wondered why hasn't this turned into evidence of a problem in the 29 States. And the following occurred to me, which I'll put to you to see what your reaction is. The defense has to do something if they are going to put duress in issue. They have to get the defendant to testify. So the prosecutor has something that the prosecutor doesn't ordinarily get. He has that defendant right on the stand, ready for jury evaluation. And that is something a -- a prosecutor may want, and it's something the defense lawyer may not want. He has to choose.

That is, the -- it can be constitutionally -- you can put the burden of proof on the defendant to prove an affirmative defense, and the Constitution has nothing to say about that. The presumption of innocence goes to all the things -- the essential elements of the crime. And here, Petitioner benefited from the presumption of innocence. The Government had to prove that she filled out those forms, that she filled them out with falsities, and that she knew she was lying when she filled out that -- those forms.

And the Court has said the same thing in the context of mens rea requirements. The Court doesn't import into statutes the mens rea requirement that was in vogue at a particular time. What it does now is it imports into all criminal statutes that do not specify a mens rea requirement -- it simply imports in a knowledge requirement, that there has to be knowing action. And that would be true regardless of whether it's an 1800 statute, an 1850 statute, a 1900 statute, or a today statute.

You can manufacture a defense for a -- for a plea of not guilty, as to -- as to why you're not guilty. So it really doesn't make a difference. It would be the same thing for self-defense. In this particular case, instead of Ms. Dixon having bought the guns, if she had gotten a hold of one of Mr. Wright's guns and shot him, she would have had a self-defense, and if she had done that, then the burden of proof would have been on the Government to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. But because she did the less blameworthy thing, that is, that she bought guns instead of shooting somebody or killing somebody, she is disadvantaged in -- in the courtroom. Because -- because she raised duress, she then had to prove her defense by a preponderance of the evidence. And it's simply not --

And she might have killed him. She might have shot him. In either case, though, she is disadvantaged by the law. She would have been better off if she had shot him or killed him, and it's simply not consistent that she does a less blameworthy action, buying guns where nobody dies, her children didn't die, there were no funerals for her, no funerals for her children, no funerals for the abuser, nobody dies, but she's disadvantage because she doesn't --

argument in Dixon v. United States # 05-7053 # 45759 # TRUE # MR. JETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This was a long-term relationship. But what happened in this particular case is the level of violence escalated substantially immediately before the gun shows. The violence had been bruising where you couldn't see it. Suddenly it -- it escalated with a gun in the face and a split lip and a sudden threat to the children that we're going -- if I kill you, I'm going to have to kill your children. So even -- even though it had gone on for a while, it suddenly changed, and her state of mind suddenly changed because what was most important to her was the safety of her children. And so she did what she thought she had to do in order to save her children and keep them safe. And it simply would not be fair that if she had done the less blameworthy action, that she has -- is more advantaged in court.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45338 # FALSE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Complaints alleging violations of the FCC's pay phone compensation regulations allege just that, violations of regulations. The regulatory violations do not give rise to private cause of action under section 206 and 207 of the Communications Act. The proper point of departure in this case begins at section 276. There Congress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing pay phone providers compensation for the services that they provide to callers who make dial around calls. There can be little doubt that the FCC has ample authority to enforce the system it created administratively. But nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else in the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's implementing regulations should give rise to a private cause of action for damages in Federal court. Official Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision allowing pay phone operators to bring through the back door the kinds of cases that Congress declined to allow through the front. There's nothing upsetting about reaching that result here. The Communications Act quite sensibly limits private damages actions in Federal court to those alleging violations of the Act itself. And claims that long distance providers -- I'm sorry -- claims that long distance providers have violated the pay phone compensation regulations require the parsing and the application of the extraordinarily complex and ever-changing FCC rules and regulations and orders.

Let me give you some examples, and then I'll distinguish it Official from this case. The easiest example is rate of return regulations that the FCC can pronounce. So the FCC can say how much long distance companies are able to charge for certain services. Fleshing out the amount that they can charge so that they're not in effect gouging consumers is a regulation that this Court could look to, but --

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45373 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that goes to the heart of this case, Justice Souter, in the kind of regulations that we have. What we have here is not the FCC telling long distance providers to give pay phone operators money that long distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators. The money that's at issue here, the 24 cents per call is the money that callers owe the pay phone operators. If you look back at the D.C. Circuit's decision --
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45374 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, do they? I mean, the statute of the United States says that -- I think I'm correct -- the statute of the United States says they can't be required, the caller cannot be required to put in the quarter in order to get the 800 number and so on. So as a matter of law, don't we have to say that the, in practical terms, the caller doesn't owe? Official Somebody owes. Somebody ought to pay for the use of this facility. But Congress has said it is not the end user.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45375 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # You are right, Justice Souter, insofar as we're trying to capture the money here for essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that the caller is availing himself of. But Congress has not said that money cannot rest on the caller's shoulders. All Congress says in Section 226 is that the caller cannot be required to pay in advance. The FCC during its rulemaking proceedings actually considered two alternatives where the caller would have paid in full compliance with Section 226. One would be the caller paying with a later billing device like a credit card, billing it to their home phone number. Another option the FCC considered would have been where the long distance providers would have billed customers on behalf of the pay phone operators. Either way, the customer would have paid. Even the respondent in his brief openly --
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45376 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, the customer is going to pay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who has to make the immediate payment, because that payment is going to be figured in the long distance rate. So that ultimately, the end user is going to pay for the service he gets, and Congress is simply saying, the way Official to make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is to require the long distance carrier to make the reimbursement. The economic end result is exactly the same as it would have been if they had said, well, you can send a bill for 25 cents to the end user.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45377 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The economic result may be the same, but with all due respect, Congress has not decreed that the administrative system work this way.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45384 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # In your answer for why they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this is what administrative agencies do all the time in typical rate regulations. They make a determination that utility shareholders have to bear this cost. The rate payers can bear this cost. And at the end of the day, it is a determination that a rate is reasonable or unreasonable. And it seems to me that that is just what is involved here. I don't know why their determination about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and whether they can pass them on or not makes it an impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or unreasonable under 201.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45385 # TRUE # MR.

And that says that violations of the Act are remediable but not of regulations, in contrast to numerous other sections.

You owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring a lawsuit and get the 2 cents. Right under 47 U.S.C. 201(b).

And that, says the FCC, is, under 201(b), an unreasonable practice. And, therefore, go in and collect it in court. Now, what is the answer to that? So far I have heard nothing that suggests Official that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was. Now, what's wrong with what I said? I'm simply trying to focus you upon what I think is the question that's bothering some of us.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45399 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There are two things that are wrong with that, Justice Breyer. The first thing is that in contrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in the absence of regulations, long distance providers would owe pay phone operators zero. There's no reason why long distance providers would give money to pay phone operators. The 24 cents here is to capture what callers owe the pay phone operators. And so the FCC has come up with an administrative system. But there's nothing unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory regime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is unjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example --
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45400 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So, my answer -- not answer, but my characterization of what you have just said is that the FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice. But in your view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay. And you want us to go back and second-guess, which Official we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is unreasonable itself. And I guess you would have to overturn it. I didn't know that was what the case was about, but are you saying now that that's the issue? They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay the money. There is a dispute. That's what we should do.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45406 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Just like AT&T when, in fact -- or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, they would not be overcharging, because they have a way of doing it that isn't on its face unjust. But the FCC writes some regulations and now it is unjust. So I guess to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a hundred years of rate making law. Wouldn't it?
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45407 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, it wouldn't. Justice Scalia, I Official think, has captained that position. And what we're saying is the FCC can pick a fair rate once it is something that long distance providers or any common carrier ought to be compensating somebody for. But what we are saying here is, this is a purely administrative creature. And then it gets to the second reason why --
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45408 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So in other words, you are saying -- I think it is common that the FCC might write some accounting rules, for example. And they might say, before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call. But given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents. And any deviation from that is unreasonable. And the company does deviate. I would have always thought when they do deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who pays too much could go into court and get money back. Am I wrong about that?

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45414 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # May I focus your return to me? Because I want to take up with where your answer to Justice Scalia left off. As I understand it, you were saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because the party or the person who is responsible for the use of the pay phone facilities is the person who's making the call, not the long distance carrier. My question to you is, isn't that simply a choice of characterization? Because another way of looking at it would be that the person who makes the call wants to use long distance facilities to get to the person he Official wants to talk to. And, therefore, the long distance facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone in order to get the customer to what the long distance facility provides. Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the carrier as for the benefit of the customer? And if that is just as fair, doesn't that end the distinction that you drew with Justice Scalia saying that it is not fair in this case.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45415 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, for two reasons. The first is -- I just want to be clear, we are not challenging the FCC's authority to have created the regulatory regime it did under 276. So the FCC could well have picked, as it did, long distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here. But the reason -- but the problem with saying that -- I'm sorry. I lost the train of thought in your question.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45416 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # My question is simply, you can say -- one way of looking at this transaction is, it is the guy making the call who's using it. Another way is to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it to get the call to the long distance facility. If you look at it in way B, doesn't your argument for unreasonableness disappear? Official
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45417 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you. That would be an entirely different case than the one we have here, Justice Souter. The 24 cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup here, if you go back and look at the regulatory system -- and that's what they are asking for, is the 24 cents that the FCC regulations entitle us to -- was calculated -- in fact, the D.C. Circuit made the FCC go through this exercise three times to get it right. So to calculate that 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of money that the caller owes the pay phone operator.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45418 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What difference does that make? What difference does that make? The use of the phone is of a value of 24 cents. But the value of using the phone is a value not only to the caller, but to the long distance provider who couldn't provide anything to the caller without the pay phone? Why isn't the alternative characterization just as easy, regardless of how they get to 24 cents?
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45419 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think another way to perhaps characterize your position is, why is this like a commission that they are seeking. And the reason why is because that number may be very different than 24 cents. If there was such a commission that could exist, it would be far less. And the respondents are not seeking that amount of money. Official
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45420 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Excuse me, but aren't you arguing with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument about what is the proper characterization of the transaction?
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45421 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't think so. All I'm saying is if you started with trying to compensate pay phone operators for the service they provide -- that you're characterizing as the service they provide to long distance carriers, you end up with a far different number. Who knows what you would end up with. Probably end up with zero. Because take an example of somebody who rents a cell phone for the weekend. They might make lots of long distance calls on the cell phone, but nobody has ever thought that a long distance carrier ought to be kicking back money, for example, to the store that rented the cell phone to the customer over the weekend. And I want to return, I think in Justice Breyer's question --
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45422 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # The reason is that the store that rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the cell phone. And in the case of the pay phone, the pay phone operator is going to get zero, unless there is some such scheme as this.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45423 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, but then we're back to the rental income question, and the question of whether it Official would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance providers, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying that rental income. And the answer, we submit, is no. And the problem that I think we've gotten off on a couple times brings us back, I think, to the assumption you asked me to make at the beginning of the argument, that something is a covered practice under the Act. And so another way to understand the distinction between the accounting rules, the rate making exercises and all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of the Act doesn't cover everything in connection with a communications service. It only covers certain practices in connection. And the history, as well as the text and structure, shows that it regulates common carriers acting as such.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45424 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It doesn't cover certain practices in connection. It covers all practices in connection.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45425 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think we agree with respondent, Mr. Chief Justice, that in looking at 201(b), you have the word such communication practices. And to understand what that is referring to, you look back up at 201(a) and see the universe. Now, the beginning of 201(a) is what we colloquially call the carrier customer section of the Official Act. And that's the core of 201(b), which says that when a common carrier is providing service, it needs to act justly and reasonably. Here -- and with accounting and rate making and all the rest, those are things that affect rates and service to customers. What we have in this case is something very different. This is a carrier-carrier relationship. So you need to look somewhere else. And what respondent says is you look to the end of 201(a), which talks about physical interconnections between carriers. But the problem with that argument, and the reason why this falls outside 201(b), even if it is somehow unjust and unreasonable, is that the carrier-carrier relationships are governed only when the FCC has ordered physical interconnection.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45426 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So you are saying that, putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers provide service to their customers is when those customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting up this rate regime in connection with that service. You would say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)?
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45427 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # As we're still talking generically, I don't think it necessarily would be. Because it could regulate the relationship between long distance providers Official and their customers. I mean, that's the core of what 201 is about. It's about how much they can charge, what kind of practices they can have in relationship to their customers. But here we're not talking about a long distance provider that is a common carrier in relationship to its customers or in relation to its rates and practices.

When I finished reading it, I thought, well, so what. You know, I mean, can you see why I thought that? I mean, today's rule is different. It is true that you don't have simply a single telephone company providing service ultimately directly to the customer. You have everything mixed up. And there are a lot of inter-carrier things. Language covers it. Purpose covers it. Facts and circumstances change.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45429 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We submit it is a not a "so what," Justice Breyer. Because section 201(b) is broad, but it's not all-encompassing. And Congress plenty of times in section 276, and in lots of other sections of the Communications Act, has responded to modern necessity by giving the FCC expanded jurisdiction, just as it did, as I said here, in section 276. But our core position here is that when Congress Official expands the FCC's authority, and it doesn't create a concomitant Federal right of action along with it, it is telling the FCC to handle these things administratively, use its expertise, craft regulations and enforce them accordingly.

Section 154(i), as well as other sections in the Act, give the Commission broad authority in crafting its administrative enforcement regimes.

Justice Scalia asked a question during Mr. Fisher's argument about, what about the accounting rules? Would they be prescribed under section 201? They would be prescribed under section 220, which is the provision of the Act that governs accounting. And they would also be prescribed under the last sentence of section 201, which is the general authority given to the FCC to promulgate all of its rules. But nothing in those facts would keep a violation of those rules from being enforced as an unjust or unreasonable practice under Section 201(b). Official

I mean, once the FCC issues a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that regulation is unjust. And that's what's happened here. And this just makes a farce of the provision that says the only private causes of action are for violations of the statute and not for violations of the regulation. It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a nullity.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45446 # TRUE # MR.

Section 201(b) says unjust or unreasonable classifications, practices, et cetera, are declared to be unlawful. So we have a very precise match in statutory text between 201(b) and 206. Now, what Mr. Fisher's argument amounts to is to say that if it is covered in a regulation, it is exempted from being called an unjust or unreasonable charge, classification, practice, et cetera, because that would allow the FCC to enforce too much. But if we start with the text Congress enacted, there is a precise match between 201(b) and 206. And to say that that which the FCC hasn't regulated is more subject to judicial review --

I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under regulation, it can't be unjust. Some regulations do relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276. I think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme. It didn't have to be this scheme. It could have been some other scheme. Nothing in the nature of things says Official that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable for this. It rather was simply imposed by the FCC. That's fine. But to say that it would be unjust for them not to do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.

Now, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to find that a violation of these rates is unjust and unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that determination.

I would have thought the contact point was what I was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is whether or not this is such communication service under 201(a), which is -- which is, again, I suppose, something that the agency gets deference on. But it would seem to Official me, that's where the limitation would come.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45460 # TRUE # MR. ENGLERT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, let me address the interplay between 201(b) and 201(a), because Mr. Fisher has simply misunderstood our position. We cited the second half of section 201(a) not to say it applies of its own force here, but to say that it disproves the contention that the communications services referred to in the phrase such communications service in 201(b) have to be limited to carrier-customer relations, because 201(a) isn't limited to carrier-customer relations. Yes, all 201(a) does of its own force is allow the prescribing of through routes and interconnections. But there is no possible way to read 201(b) as limited to carrier-carrier communications in light of the full breadth of practices covered by 201(b). So that's the reason to cite 201(a) is simply to disprove Mr. Fisher's contention about the limits on 201(b). The phrase such communications service is actually used in 201(a) and in 201(b), and the antecedent in the first few words of 201(a), the such communications service, is interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio. So 201(b) isn't necessarily restricted to either carrier-carrier or carrier-customer relations, but such communication service relates back to all Official communication by wire or radio, which is what we have here.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45466 # TRUE # MR. ENGLERT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, they have furnished a communications service to a customer, not to us, but to a customer. So again, this is connected with that communications service. And as the colloquy with Justice Souter earlier touched on, the caller pays sooner or later. Under the FCC's regulatory scheme, and in part because of the prohibition on advanced caller payment in 226(e)(2), what happens is the long distance carrier gets the money, and they're saying there's no private right of action to make them give it back. In other words, the world would look quite different without a regulatory Official scheme, but it would not be a regulatory scheme in which they get all the money they are currently purporting to keep. Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked a question about the flash point on whether the FCC was improperly or suspiciously commenting on the scope of the private right of action as opposed to interpreting a substantive provision. The private right of action provisions are 206 through 208, the provisions that let the complainant go to either court or the Commission. The FCC said nothing controversial about the scope of 206 through 208. The controversy is over the scope of 201(b), which is a substantive provision. But once you have something brought within the scope of 201(b), after the application of traditional tools of statutory construction with Chevron deference, the private right of action follows automatically under 206 and 207. It is not a matter of the FCC reaching out to say, we are going to create a private right of action. It is a matter of the FCC construing a substantive term with consequences for a private right of action.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45467 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, I think that's right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as particularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the consequences of its determination that something is Official unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with respect to a private right of action.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45472 # TRUE # MR. ENGLERT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- 206 through 208, Your Honor, I might agree. But they construed 201(b) and commented on the consequence. And this is quite important, that it is their business, because 208 is the provision under which each and every one of those Commission proceedings cited in the Sprint brief, which Mr. Fisher alluded to, has proceeded before the agency. 208, just like 206, requires a violation of the Act, so it is very much their business to decide whether these pay phone controversies state violations of the Act. If they don't, the Commission has absolutely no power to proceed under 208, which is the only provision under which any administrative proceeding has ever gone forward. There are some arguments made here that they clearly have the authority to proceed administratively even if you can't go to court, but Mr. Fisher hasn't Official identified the source of that authority. And the sources identified in the brief are section 4(i), which has been problematic, and others -- and other sections on which the FCC has never relied on in this setting, and some kind of divination of an action within Section 276 itself. The question was put at one point to Mr. Fisher, could the FCC mandate fee-shifting as part of this administrative remedy it's going to create. Well, if you read 276 broadly, it's giving the Commission great powers to create administrative remedies, notwithstanding 208, which was supposed to be the administrative provision, then maybe anything goes. But we're getting awfully far from the statute that Congress wrote and giving the FCC awfully expansive powers to construe 276, while also denying the FCC rather mundane powers to construe rather ordinary phrases of administrative law, "unjust or unreasonable," in 201(b). Now, with respect to the question of whether this is a practice in connection with a communications service, Mr. Fisher argues strenuously that it is not.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45480 # TRUE # MR. ENGLERT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # With respect to the question whether practices are limited to carrier-customer relations, I've already touched on that by talking about the interplay between 201(a) and 201(b). But there's another angle of approach for that issue, which is that in the Louisiana Service -- Louisiana Public Service Commission case, this Court was asked to draw the inference, just as it has Official been in this Court, from other provisions in the Communications Act, that those phrases always refer to carrier-customer relations. And the Court said, no, that phrase can also refer to depreciation rules, so it's not limited to carrier-customer relations, the inference from other provisions of the Act doesn't flow. And the reason is there are words of limitation when those words, "charges, classifications, rates or practices" are used in those other sections that make it clear that they apply only to tariffed services. You find no such words of limitation in 201(a) and 201(b) -- or in 201(b), excuse me. Now, there remains the argument that there's a mismatch between section 201 and the relevant regulations because the regulations apply to intrastate as well as interstate calls, and section 201 applies to interstate or foreign communications. That argument appears for the very first time in merits briefing in this Court. It wasn't made below. It wasn't made in the cert petition. It wasn't made to the agency. And that's a problem, because the limits of the FCC's ability to regulate jurisdictionally mixed communications depend on factual determinations, factual determinations neither the agency nor even the lower courts have ever been given a chance to make. Official But had this issue been raised in a timely fashion, I suggest that it would have been appropriate for the FCC to reach intrastate as well as interstate communications because long distance -- dial-around calls are overwhelmingly long distance, overwhelmingly interstate, and it is difficult to sort out which calls are which. In fact, the seven years of rulemaking the FCC underwent in this case largely were because of the difficulties of keeping track of particular pay phone calls.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45481 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # I saw that argument. I have to say I don't understand it. Why is it so difficult? I get a bill every month that easily sorts out which are interstate and which are intrastate.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45482 # TRUE # MR. ENGLERT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Sorting one call from one carrier that has a relationship with you is not difficult, or sorting 100 calls from a carrier that has a relationship with you is not difficult. But when you go from a PSP to an inter-exchange carrier to a switch-based reseller, matching up the information of all three is -- has proven, in practice, to be quite difficult. And it's especially difficult in an era in which you can't just tell by area codes, for example, whether something is interstate. If I dial 202 to 202, I may be dialing someone's cell phone out of Official state. Now, the judgment below could be explained on the alternative ground that a violation of the regulations constitutes a violation of section 276. Before I even get to the substantive discussion, let me respond to the absolutely groundless claim that that argument has been abandoned. Global Crossing cites a bunch of cases involving section 1291 appeals in which people didn't appeal a particular order after final judgment, and says that's an abandonment of the claim. That's both correct and irrelevant. This is a 1292(b) appeal and there is no final judgment on any claim in this case, certainly not on the 276 claim, so my client certainly hasn't abandoned it. My client was also a party to Greene and lost Greene and has argued the merits of the section 276 position all along. On the merits, section 276 contains rights-creating language that creates a concrete monetary entitlement, focuses on the party benefitted, and does not have an aggregate focus. Global Closing doesn't even try to defend the Ninth and D.C. Circuits' reasoning that the statute does not contain rights-creating language. That leaves the tricky question whether a violation of the regs can be deemed a violation of the Act itself when Congress specified only the right, but Official didn't specify what fair compensation was, and didn't specify who had to pay the compensation. In that respect, I think Alexander v. Sandoval, though it's been cited against us repeatedly, is actually helpful to our position. That case says it's meaningless talk about a violation of the regs separate from a violation of the Act, and that a Congress that intends an Act to be enforced intends the regulations filling out the Act to be enforced. I think the theory of Chevron itself is also helpful to our position in this regard, because the point of Chevron is that the use of broad language constitutes an administrative -- a delegation of authority to the administrative agency, not just to fill in details, but to give definitive content to a statute whose direct content is less than definitive. So it is perfectly appropriate to talk about this statute, section 276, and its rights-creating language as ordering the FCC not just to create a plan, but ordering the FCC to create a plan that has a particular goal such that violation of that goal can be deemed a violation of section 276 itself.

The scope of the remedies before the Commission under the kind of standard primary provision of the Act that deals with damages, 208, and 207 mentions it as well, the scope of the action before the Commission and before the court is exactly the same.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45487 # TRUE # MR. FELDMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. The Act in 207 -- I believe it's 207 -- specifically says that you may, the court may award attorneys' fees in an action in court. It doesn't provide that -- there's no similar provision for actions before the Commission. But the scope of the kind of Official thing that Congress decided that a complainant could bring either to the Commission or to court is exactly the same. There's no way to drive a wedge between them. There are other provisions of the Act, as Mr. Fisher said, where Congress specifically authorized the Commission -- an action before the Commission for damages. But those are -- those provisions which Mr. Fisher cited are in section 226, which do not have to do with common carriers. They have to do with automatic dialing, with do-not-call lists, with things like that, where the person who's violating it is definitely not the -- never going to be a common carrier. In those provisions, Congress found it necessary to say, okay, we have to now give you the authority to create a damage action. But in other provisions, where you are dealing with common carrier, 206 through 208 provides Congress's determination of what the scope of a damage action should be either before the Commission or before a court.

That is absolutely standard from the very beginning of the Interstate Commerce Act, that you can't look at the words "just and reasonable" and decide whether a rate was just and reasonable or the practices that a carrier is using are just and reasonable. In fact, the whole --

I would add also, with respect to the Commission's determination about what is just and reasonable, it was not just a question of saying that a violation of the regulations is just and reasonable. The Commission was charged here with the responsibility for adopting a compensation scheme that would provide for fair compensation for each pay phone operator for each and every call. And it spent a number of years and a number of different attempts working out what is a fair compensation. I would submit that all of that reasoning about what is a fair compensation scheme is also reasoning why it's unjust and unreasonable for a carrier not to pay the compensation. It's not just simply a question of an ipse dixit, it's a question of years of rulemaking and working out what the scheme should be, so it's fair. Once it did that, it didn't require a lot of explanation for why a failure to pay fair compensation that had been worked out over this period of time, a failure to pay that was unjust and unreasonable.

I'm really expanding on that point, that it didn't -- the FCC has always gotten deference for what -- determining what is unjust and unreasonable under the Act. And it didn't require a great deal of explanation. The FCC's explanation here was more than adequate in light of its years of explanation about why this -- this scheme with these rates and these carriers and the primary economic beneficiary being the one who pays. All of that were reasons why this was fair compensation. Once it decided all of that, it didn't take much to say that a failure to pay fair compensation is unjust and unreasonable. That was adequately explained and didn't require a huge additional amount of explanation.

argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45508 # TRUE # MR. FELDMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think in that case also, I would probably be here arguing that maybe if the FCC had determined that it's necessary, for whatever regulations they came up with under that scheme, in order for the Act to function correctly, that they have to be complied with.

But this case, if the question is, did the FCC adequately explain what it did here, I think that all of the years of explanation of why something is fair are also reasons why it was unjust and unreasonable not to pay the compensation.

Mr. Englert mentioned a couple. I mean, there's probably numerous ones that wouldn't be. And in fact, the question about most FCC action, or at least a lot of FCC action, regulations, adjudications, and so on, most of them have to do with carriers' obligations, and most of them are things that have to do with what's unjust and unreasonable under the Act. And they've been enforced for years, in the -- you know, from the very early cases under the Interstate Commerce Act. Official Mr. Fisher also suggested that there's a difficulty with numerous district courts deciding these issues as opposed to the FCC. Well, I would suggest that Congress decided that these kinds of actions can go either to district court or to the FCC. And in fact, by making damages actions, the scope of damages actions, as opposed to other remedies, co-extensive, did anticipate that there would be that result. The primary jurisdiction --

Thank you.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45517 # TRUE # THE COURT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Fisher, you have three minutes remaining.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45519 # FALSE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you. Let me begin, Mr. Chief Justice, with your question about whether the FCC can opine on remedies. All you need to do is look to what the FCC was telling everybody it was deciding in these order proceedings. It was deciding, and asked for notice and comment, on whether PSPs have a remedy for violations of the pay phone regulations. That is cited everywhere Official in the briefs. It never asked for notice and comments, or considered whether failure to pay under the regulations is a violation of 201(b). So the question this Court needs to ask itself is when the FCC, by its own acknowledgment, until now, is simply opining on the presence of a Federal court remedy, whether it gets deference simply because it hangs the hook on a substantive provision of the statute. Now, there are three problems with what the FCC has done in construing section 201. The first is that this is not a covered practice, because I want to make clear our position, it's that the FCC has plenty of authority with respect to carrier-customer relationships, but not with respect to carrier-supplier relationships. And that's what we have here. On unjust and unreasonable, I think we need to unpack two separate questions. One is whether the rate the FCC chose is reasonable, whether the amount of money that it said needs to be put into pay phone operators' pockets is a fair and reasonable choice. We have no dispute about that. And we think that in and of itself could generate deference. But the FCC's determination to put the payment obligation on long distance carriers simply can't be shoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in Official 201(b), because if that's -- the only reason why anything, us failing to pay the money, would be because of the regulations. And you hear it again and again in their argument, the FCC having concluded that long distance companies are the ones that pay, the failure to pay is unjust and unreasonable. There's no way to get there without the regulations, and that's what distinguishes --
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45520 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That's not true. You can say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your customers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if there wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to use your service.
argument in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones Telecommunications # 05-705 # 45521 # TRUE # MR. FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The FCC might have said that, but as I said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here, and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that the FCC might have come up with when it was trying to encapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but under your reasoning may be something very small. But that would be a very different case. Two more things. One is, on the jurisdictional mismatch question, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly right. It is not hard -- there are plenty of hard things in this case, but figuring out whether a call is Official interstate or intrastate is not one of them. All you need to know is where the call originated from, and the number that was dialed, and pay phone operators have that information.

FISHER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think it still constitutes a long distance call, depending on where the cell phone owner lives. And that's still an easy thing to figure out, where the area code is. Finally, Justice Stevens, you asked a question about the co-extensive nature of the remedies under 206 and 208. We don't dispute that the statute itself is co-extensive. What we're saying is that 276 gives the FCC more than ample authority to do what it's doing.

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45015 # FALSE # MR. LAMKEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Section 2415(a) established a limitations period for every action for money damages by the Government which is founded on any contract. That provision, by its terms, applies to every contract action, every adversary adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach, whether pursued before a court or an agency. The contention that every action encompasses only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for three reasons. First, it is inconsistent with the broad language that Congress used. It is inconsistent with the statutory structure, in that it renders another provision, the exception for administrative offset, totally superfluous. It also creates an irrationality in the hierarchy of the Government's claims. Finally, it robs Section 2415(a) of its intended effect. Turning to the text, Congress Official and agencies regularly use the term "action" to refer to adversary adjudications before administrative agencies and before the judiciary. The term --

Doesn't the statute, in effect, say, "We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly -- what possibly might be included as an administrative proceeding"? If they had wanted an administrative proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to say in -- to refer, instead of to "administrative proceedings," to "administrative actions"?

But counterclaims and offsets typically aren't brought by complaint; they're brought in the answer, they're submitted in the answer.

People must file their claims before an agency first, and then the agency can do administrative adjustment. That's entirely separate from the attorney general's ability to compromise the claim once it's filed in court. Section -- title 5 also contains things that apply to courts and agencies -- the right to judicial review of agency actions, the waiver of immunity that's necessary for those -- in addition to standards that govern judicial review of agency actions.

These are all things that would apply, we would expect, both to a civil action in court and an administrative-agency action, as well. They may work better for one or the other in different particular circumstances, but they are all sufficiently broad that they can be used in both circumstances. And the one the Government, in the administrative context, would be most interested in would be subsection C. When the Government just doesn't know the facts, or the Government reasonably couldn't know the facts, it gets an exception, just tolling, until it reasonably could have known of the fact. And that's just as applicable in an action before an agency as it would be in an action before a court. In addition, the Government's contrary Official construction renders an entire provision superfluous.

And that is, it creates sort of an Official irrationality in the hierarchy of claims for the Government. Offensive judicial actions to extract money from private individuals must be brought within 6 years. Administrative offsets for the Government to try and avoid paying money, those must be brought within 10 years, under the administrative offset provision that was enacted together with the exception in (i). However, offensive administrative actions to extract money may be brought in perpetuity, forever. It simply strains credulity to believe that Congress, at the same time it was saying the Government has only 10 years to assert administrative offsets to avoid paying money, instead intended administrative agencies to be able to extract money on that very same claim --

And the Government's construction here is inconsistent with the ordinary hierarchy which allows the Government to avoid making payment on more favorable terms; then the Government gets to go in and forcibly extract money from private individuals. Finally, the Government's construction also undermines the intended effect of the statute. The effect of statute -- the purpose of statutes of limitations -- and this one, in particular -- is to provide repose -- to allow the individual to know that he will no longer confront Government claims, to dispose of his documents, and also to encourage the Government to be diligent in pursuing its claims.

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45144 # FALSE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The presumption is that the Government is not bound by a statute of limitations. And, when read as a whole, Section 2415(a) does not overcome that presumption, but instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in court. There are several reasons for that. First, the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer to suits in court. Second, the statute expressly distinguishes between administrative proceedings and actions. Third the statute's located in the judicial code. Fourth, the committee reports, for those who are inclined to consider them, strongly support the statute's ordinary meaning. And, fifth, even if some administrative proceedings were governed by Section 2415(a), these would not, because they do not involve a complaint. Now, on the first of those points, the term "action" ordinarily refers to the pursuit of a right in court, which just is why, just 7 years ago, in West v. Official Gibson, every member of this Court agreed that the term "action" often refers only to suits in court, and not to administrative proceedings.

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45148 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the structure of the law here is that in those instances where Congress does authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides a context-specific administrative limitations period, such as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all of the contract claims the Government can pursue administratively. Congress specifically enacted a 6-year limitations period for the submission of a claim to a contracting officer. In this unique context, however, Congress had Official very good reasons for not applying a limitations period until it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996. The reason is that what Congress found here, in context of mineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent commission, was that the companies were historically on an honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties of up to half a billion dollars annually. So, what Congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current and past lease accounts. One of the committee reports said to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress that was not concerned with repose, but with getting some of those vast underpayments back from the companies. Now, when we fast-forward to 1996 --

JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, but -- well, we are, because Official the structure of the law here is that Section 2415(a), as we see it, governs court suits. And that works, because, when Congress authorizes administrative recovery, it almost always provides a specific -- context-specific administrative limitations period. Also, when Congress was telling the agency to focus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a statute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in that contemporary context, did not understand that there was a limitations period, either, because the orders that issued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9, sometimes more, years than that.

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45160 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, the OLC opinion was limited, by both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative offsets, not to administrative adjudications. And if I could explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the situation -- this is what OLC was looking at -- where the Government, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a person, and, because it thought that person owed it money, Official what the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the retirement benefits. What OLC opined is that that is a -- nothing more than a prejudgment attachment. And OLC thought that if the Government is time-barred from obtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from obtaining a prejudgment attachment. An administrative adjudication is significantly different, because it does provide an actual judgment. So, there are a couple of important points from that. First is that the dispute between OLC and the Comptroller General was limited by its terms to administrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the Comptroller General did opine beyond that, that the statute specifically applies only to suits in court. But the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets. So, when Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice Alito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45161 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But -- excuse me -- how could OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings? I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which you're urging here, which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings. I mean, that's the point. Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position taken by the Justice Department was that this statute Official relates to administrative proceedings.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45162 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, the position of OLC was limited to administrative offsets, and it did not -- the important thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the statutory term "action," or, frankly, any other statutory term. Instead, it had a theory, which was probably wrong, that administrative offsets are unique because they are prejudgment attachment devices. That's the dispute that went to Congress, and that's the dispute that Congress actually resolved. And, in any event, going forward --
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45163 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, on that theory, then, there was -- there was no time issue with respect to the right to offset, then, in the OLC's position.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45164 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, the OLC's view is that if the Government was time-barred from obtaining a judgment under Section 2415(a), then it would be time-barred from obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

If that's the case, then timing should have nothing to do with it. Conversely, as Justice Scalia said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing Official presumably derives from this provision; this provision, therefore, must have been assumed to apply to administrative proceedings. So, either there's no time question with respect to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with respect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that this provision applies to administrative proceedings.

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45188 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The point's just -- the OLC reasoning was admittedly somewhat odd, but that was the context in which Congress was responding to. And, going forward, it is not surplusage, because the issue still Official arises. If the Government could pursue its suit only in court, it would be time-barred from pursuing a suit in court. The question would then still arise, under the OLC opinion, unless it had been overruled, whether the Government could, nonetheless, obtain a prejudgment attachment, even though it cannot obtain judgment. That's all that Congress was looking at there. And, as this Court's recognized in cases like O'Gilvie and Vonn, when Congress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute, oftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more than that. We -- I agree, though, that terms -- to get back to the beginning of this discussion -- terms do not always have their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do, especially when a statute must be strictly construed. And here, the context confirms that "action" does have its ordinary meaning, for several reasons. First, the ordinary meanings of the other key statutory terms, such as "right of action," "complaint," and "defendant," as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court. A "right of action" is the right to bring a suit in court; a "defendant" is the person defending in court ordinarily; and a "complaint" is the document that initiates proceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a Official civil action, which is a suit in court. Especially when those terms are used together, this Court recognized, in Unexcelled Chemical, that a reference to commencing a action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a suit in court, not a pleading before an administrative agency. The statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose an action against an administrative proceeding by saying that the time to file an action does not run until after the administrative proceedings have concluded, which certainly gives weight to the point that the action is -- an administrative proceeding is not an action.

JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The ones that we have found were -- I'm not 100-percent sure, but the ones that we -- that we have found and cited in our brief do appear to be enacted after that time. I think the reason is that -- I mean, historically, administrative -- obviously, court suits have been around a lot longer than administrative adjudications. And, as Congress has authorized Official administrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a case-by-case basis. And every time that it enacted a context-specific administrative adjudications period since 1966 -- in theory, it could have just done an across-the-board one for all agency adjudications, but, instead, it's chosen to deal with the context-specific; in part, because of the great variety of administrative procedure. I mean, as this case illustrates, a statute of limitations that governs a complaint in an action is just not going to work in a lot of administrative contexts. Here, there's no complaint. An "order" is a legally binding order. It doesn't seek relief, it imposes it. And unless it is both appealed and stayed pending appeal --

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45243 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right. Well, there are a few points, both legal and practical. On the legal, until 1966 that absolutely was the law, because historically no limitations period ever applies against the Government. And that's the reason for the strict construction canon, that the statute applies here only if it clearly applies, and thereby bars the Government from forcing the law in the public interest.

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45245 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Not contract. I mean, the historic rule is that the Government is not bound by statutes of limitations, because what it's doing is enforcing the law in the public interest. Now, in 1966, Congress enacted Section 2415(a) so that there would prospectively be a contract limitations period. But it's strictly construed, because of the historical backdrop and the importance of enforcing the law in the public interest. So that's why we do have a strict construction canon here. As a --

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45255 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I didn't mean in the leasing context here. But in the leasing context, one -- there are a couple of important points. One is that the Government does not have enough resources to audit all of the current accounts in all of the years, which is one of the reasons that we need to be able to go back farther when we catch the violation. As a -- but as a result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing resources off of today to do a frolicking detour into 50 years ago, there's a reason that's never happened. In addition, the farther we try to go back, the greater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the companies have the information that shows what royalties they would owe, and if they lawfully destroy those records after 6 years, it makes it even harder for us to try to go back, because of proof problems.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45256 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # That's another indication. Why would you allow them to destroy those records after 6 Official years if you -- if you thought -- if you thought that there was no statute of limitations to claims for these things? I mean, that's just another inconsistency that -- in the statutory scheme that's created.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45257 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, no, the --
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45258 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # You say, "You can destroy your records after 6 years." Well, why? It doesn't make any sense.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45259 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, first, it's optional, not mandatory. If they want to keep them, they --
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45260 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Yes.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45261 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- certainly can. But there's no -- and, as a practical matter -- I mean, because the Government bears the initial burden of going forward, if the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on balance, going to be in its favor. But, in addition, there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the Secretary can require they be kept for longer. In addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof issues in situations where the statute might, because of tolling, be much longer. So, there's not a strict Official congruence. There is also no indication that Congress enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was thinking about a 6-year limitations period. There's never been any linkage between the two. If I could briefly cover, then, also -- I mean, in addition to all the textual points, this is also located in the judicial code. And, although it's true that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly. Every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code -- and Petitioners identified no examples -- every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code, it refers to a suit in court, and only a suit in court. When a provision of the judicial code applies to something else, it will say so. For example, 28 U.S. Code 2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty proceedings, refers to an "action, suit, or proceeding." The Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what it's talking about is submitting something to an agency. So, if Congress was going to legislate against the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the provision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially Official clear -- especially a clear intent, when it's trying to govern administrative proceedings. The committee reports also strongly confirm that, because they not only say that the statute defines the time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S. courts, and not only use court terminology from front to back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings. The committee has explained that the reason for that provision was the great number and variety of administrative proceedings. So, in other words, Congress was saying, "There's a great variety of administrative procedure. We're just not going to deal with that here. We're taking it off the table by saying this limitations period does not expire until a year after those administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have expired." There's also some relevance in the fact that this legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as part of an overall package of reforms that would govern the civil litigation that the Department was handling in the courts. It was then referred to the Judiciary Committees, not to the House Government Reform Committees Official that might consider administrative procedure matters, and, as I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial code. From start to finish, this legislation has never had anything to do with anything other than court suits, which is why Congress has expressly provided for context-specific administrative systems -- limitations periods -- which make sense in the context of the relevant administrative procedures.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45262 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, except when you -- when you say "this legislation," you limit it to the body of 2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's "one."

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45264 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # It's (i). I mean, that clearly does apply to administrative proceedings. And I could understand the argument that Congress was just making things doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to administrative proceedings. I could understand that argument if the way (i) was written is, "The provisions of this section shall not apply to administrative proceedings." And then I would say, "You know, oh, well, that was always the case, and this is just making it clear." It doesn't say that. It says that -- the only Official administrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these offsets.

I would -- it means, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and that's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this section was adopted this year, and the other section was adopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look at the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that administrative proceedings, despite the fact that "action" is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.
argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45267 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I mean, it's -- there's no doubt the statute should be read as a whole. But, as this Court has explained in cases like the O'Gilvie and Vonn cases cited in our brief, when a court's trying to make sense of a statute read as a whole, oftentimes it will find that when Congress faces a specific dispute and amends a statute to resolve that specific dispute, that's all it resolves, and there's no reason to draw further negative inference, especially here, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, where a strict construction canon applies.

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45269 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, because -- I mean, and it is an important point, that the statute applies only if it clearly applies by its terms. And it seems to me, the best that Petitioners can do is to say that some of the statutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous. But that -- all that means, as I said, is that, under the strict construction canon, we would prevail. And even if the statute governs some administrative proceedings, but not others, it would not govern these, for the reason I gave earlier, which is that there's no complaint here. We talked, before, about the ways in which an order is not a complaint. It's another important point, though, that in order not only -- it is -- not only does it not begin the proceedings, it normally ends them, because appeals are only taken about a quarter of the time. And in some limited circumstances there's not even a right of appeal, if the Assistant Secretary issued the order. So --

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45277 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct. There's no -- in an issue letter, there's no claim for relief, just a claim for the request for information, and there's no allegation of wrongdoing. So, it's just not a complaint in those ways. Also, it doesn't -- it's not really fair to say that it begins proceedings, because it comes between an audit and an order to pay. So it doesn't -- and plus, it's, of course, not filed in a civil action. And, in that respect, it doesn't satisfy any of the -- any of the elements of the -- of the ordinary definition of "complaints."

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45291 # TRUE # MR. JOSEFFER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- fundamental point than that, too, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using these terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across-the-board rule that applies to suits in court. And, finally, one thing I should also emphasize is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive administrative scheme. Petitioners like to say that, "Well, we could just as easily be in court." There's a reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever been brought by the Government in a court. And that's, first, that Congress directed the agency to establish a comprehensive auditing and collection system, and then gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its administrative orders. The only way the agency could administer thousands of leases with something like #9 billion in royalties every year is to do this in an efficient administrative manner. Congress has not only authorized that, and ratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the agency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old leases, precisely because Congress knew that is a Official standalone administrative scheme, and it's never provided the administrative limitations period for the standalone administrative scheme. If there are no more questions --

I wanted to start with the ordinary meaning of the term "action." I was somewhat bemused by the Government's insistence that had -- the term "action" in West versus Gibson was construed -- it must mean an action before a court, and has that as its ordinary meaning. The Solicitor General's own position in West versus Gibson, on page 25 and -6 of its brief was, "Section 1981(a) does not, however, define the term 'action' as being limited to judicial proceedings. The statutory language, read in context, suggests that no such limitation was intended." Page 6 of the Government's reply, "The term 'action,' in Section 1981, can reasonably be construed as Official encompassing both administrative and judicial proceedings." The term "action" is a term that's used for adversary adjudicative proceedings, whether those are in court or before an agency. It is not limited to administrative agency proceedings, as the Government itself recognized in West versus Gibson. There are more general terms here. There's also "complaint," there's also "defendant." There's a number of those. But those general terms are also the terms of adversary adjudication. And Congress uses them, as far back as 1921, for adversary adjudications before agencies.

But if -- I would encourage the Court to look at the definitions in FOGRSFA, 1724 and 1702(A), which tell you what, under -- in Congress's view, commences the Official proceedings here. And, in Congress's view, what commences the proceedings, what triggers the new statute of limitations and stops it from running, is the order to pay, which Congress defines as a "demand."

LAMKEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The language that has been used, and -- as a result of very odd historical anomalies and attempts to introduce a sense of due process to these proceedings over time -- is odd, and it is awkward. But it's clear that when Congress wrote the scope of this statute, it said it applies to "every action for money damages by the Government which is founded in contract." It doesn't say "actions that are begun by complaint." Now, the complaint is what Congress assumes will stop the provision from running. And there is always, in an adversary adjudication, some document that functions like a complaint, that provides the defendant the notice of what the claims are against it, and to which failure to respond will result in default. We believe that the most likely thing to be the complaint here is, the thing that provided us with notice, Official is that -- "Boys, you've got to respond; otherwise, you're in trouble" -- was the order to pay. And Congress came to that same conclusion when it enacted -- when it enacted FOGRSFA and established a 7-year statute of limitations provision. But if we lose 2 years of the claim, and only get 1 because it is the agency letter, in the Court's view, well, that's fine, but there's some document here that started these agency proceedings, and it is that document which is a complaint.

And in terms of the OLC letter, we offered to lodge it in our brief. Unfortunately, by the Court's rules, we're not allowed to lodge it, unless the Court specifically requests it. And so, that's why it's not there. But we will get that to you, or the Government will get it to you, as soon as possible. The actual agency letter, in this case, isn't in the administrative record. And it turns out that we haven't been able to find it, and the Government hasn't been able to find it. And so, it's a letter. It's a Official demand letter, but it is a letter, and that -- the order to pay is actually the opening salvo in these proceedings.

It would be all leases which involve minerals other than oil and gas, whether it be coal, gold, silver, anything like that. It would also be all claims before September -- all production before September of 1996. That introduces something of an oddity, if one accepts the Government's position. It would be that, for all claims going forward from September of 1996, the Government has 7 years, but, for the prior 200 years, those claims persist in perpetuity. When Section 2415(a) itself was enacted, Congress avoided precisely that result by deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date the statute of limitations was enacted. And the very fact that Congress didn't do that here is evidence that Congress -- to the extent it has anything to do with it at all -- is evidence that Congress, in fact, understood that there already was a statute of limitations applicable. And, in fact --

argument in BP America Production Company against the Secretary # 05-669 # 45330 # TRUE # MR. LAMKEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- Act has an exception at the front and says "notwithstanding 2415." It's its own animal to itself. And there is a clause at the front of 2415 that says "except as otherwise provided by Congress." And so, Congress often takes exceptions. And when it modified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an exception to the 2415 regime. So, Congress knows how to conduct specialized situations and take things outside of 2415 when it needs to. But it enacted Section 2415 as a catchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't Official managed to anticipate the circumstances. And the Government's premise of the whole provision is that Congress botched it. Congress provided a catchall that catches judicial actions, but leaves the Government free, in perpetuity, to persist -- to proceed on precisely the same claims for precisely the same relief, plus interest. And, because interest is calculated at a relatively high rate, that makes those old claims much, much more valuable than the relatively more recent claims. And it seems implausible to think that Congress enacted a catchall limitations period with a loophole so large that it deprives the statute of limitations period of effect almost entirely. Finally, I'd like to say, one moment about the statute -- the canon of strict construction. And that is that it doesn't always require the court to narrow otherwise broad statutory language, particularly where doing so would have the effect of rendering another provision -- here, subsection (i) is superfluous -- introducing anomalies into the statutory structure and depriving the statute of its intended effect, as the Bowers case we cite in our reply brief on page 16 makes clear. And Bowers case was virtually on point. It was the case where the -- it was a statute of limitations that could have applied to administrative agency actions, Official or it could not have. And the Court declined to accept a narrowing construction proffered by the Government under statute of strict construction because it would have rendered one of the provisions -- one for consent proceedings -- superfluous, because it would have resulted in anomaly, and because it would have undermined the premise of repose which undergirded the statute of limitations in that case. Precisely the same things are true here. And, for those reasons, the Court should reach precisely the same result. If there are no further questions, thank you very much.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44764 # FALSE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The procedure for imposing aggravated sentences under California's Determinate Sentencing Law implicates the bright line rule this Court set forth in Blakely and Apprendi. Any fact other than the fact of a prior conviction which increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The primary point of contention in this case is what constitutes the statutory maximum under California's Determinate Sentencing Law. Petitioner believes that it's the middle term, whereas respondent maintains that it's the upper term. In fact, this case really boils down to just one question. Can a judge in California legally impose an upper term sentence based solely on the facts reflected in the jury's verdict or the defendant's admissions. The answer to this question is no. California's Determinate Sentencing Law specifies three possible prison terms for each -- for each felony conviction, a lower term, a middle term, and an upper term, although it mandates that judges shall impose the middle term unless there are factors of aggravation or mitigation. California case law confirms that judges must impose the middle term where there are no aggravating factors, and even the state appears to concede the point. Because the middle term is the greatest punishment a judge can impose based solely on the facts reflected in the jury's verdict, it, and not the upper term, constitutes the statutory maximum for --

GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, Justice Stevens, to the extent that a fact is found by the jury which can be used as an aggravating factor, but is not an element of the crime or found by the jury as an enhancement, that could be used to impose an upper term sentence.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44782 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Counsel, the thing that concerns me about your case is that California's system looks a lot like the Federal system after Booker. We haven't addressed the issue or had a case involving review of reasonableness for upward departure. But at least as the circuits have said it, in a federal case, the district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any reason for departing from what the guidelines might suggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be -- I think in most circuits, that would be reversed. Same here. If a California judge imposes the upper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to be reversed. But if a federal judge gives a statement of his reasons, you know, a vulnerable victim, or an offender likely to offend again, whatever, under most circuit law, that's going to be upheld. Here, if the California judge does that, that's going to be still struck down under your view. You talked about Blakely and Apprendi. But how does this system look to you under Booker?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44783 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Your Honor, this system really is -- this is just like -- this case is just like Blakely. What the California Supreme Court in People against Black found, they used references to reasonableness as a label and a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of Blakely and Apprendi. Instead they tried to fit the Determinate Sentencing Law within the Federal system this Court found constitutional in Booker. But the California Supreme Court seriously misread Booker. In Booker, in the remedial portion of that decision, this Court found the Federal system to be constitutional by rendering the guidelines -- the mandatory guidelines to be advisory. Now --
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44784 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Under California, they're advisory anyway. I mean, even if the judge makes the necessary finding to get up into the higher tier, he doesn't have to impose the higher sentence, he can impose the lower one.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44786 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # My point is if he makes a finding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16 years in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher term, he can go back to the middle term.

One example is the question of consecutive versus concurrent sentences, which may have very little to do with facts. A second example might be that a judge in a particular community says there's been an unbelievable rash of breaking and entering. I see how the writers of this guideline, of the statute that embodies it, thought that breaking and entering was X, occurred with X frequency, but we have in this community a sudden rash of crime, such that I think the reasonable thing to do is to increase the sentence as a deterrent. Now, suppose that's what he writes. And is there anything in California law, as you understand Black, that makes that unlawful?

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44801 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, in Black, the California Supreme Court repeatedly stated that the way the system works in California is that it is a mandatory system. So as an example, at 35 Cal.4th 1254, the court stated, "the court cannot impose the upper term unless there is at least one aggravating factor." At 1260, the court said, "in a case in which no aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose the upper term." There are a number of statements throughout the Black opinion that indicate the system has never changed from a mandatory one to an advisory one, so that reasonableness is not the issue. Whether the system is mandatory or advisory --

Let's take a hypothetical case where the statutory range after convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred years. And let's say you have two judges who have these cases. And one sentences the defendant to zero, probation. The other one sentences the defendant to a hundred years. Without saying a word of explanation for either sentence, isn't the appellate court in that situation going to say, you have to tell us why you have chosen zero or why you have chosen 100? And if the trial judge provides an explanation, isn't the trial judge necessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the judge believes to be true about the offense and the offender?

GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, if you're describing the Federal system or just a hypothetical system, my understanding in a indeterminate type of system, a judge can impose whatever sentence he wants.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44831 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But isn't it reviewed for reasonableness -- isn't the reasonableness review necessarily going to require what is, in essence, fact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by an appellate court?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44832 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor. But what -- in Booker, what made the Federal system constitutional was not the engraftment of the reasonableness review. It was rendering the mandatory guidelines advisory. And that's the aspect of California's Supreme Court Black decision that they've misread the Booker decision.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44833 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why is that, why is that so? Why isn't the middle sentence, just like what the guideline -- what the guideline would indicate? And if a Federal court would say, if I sentence within the guideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many courts have held. Not this Court yet. That would be presumptively valid. And if I go outside, I have to give a reason that will survive appellate review. Well, why isn't the middle sentence identical in function to the Federal sentencing guidelines advice?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44834 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Ginsburg, I think that it's the mandatory nature in California of the middle term. The judge cannot exceed the middle term unless he finds at least one aggravating factor. And my understanding in the Federal system is that the judge can exceed the -- can exceed these guideline ranges and that they're just advisory.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44835 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # To say that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable. So under the Federal system, it is perfectly possible -- unless, unless we hold otherwise -- for a judge to give a sentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to be affirmed, because although the guideline range is reasonable, there are other systems that would be reasonable, right?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44836 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your -- Justice Scalia.

I mean, in a way, it is kind of the -- the Black opinion, the day after, if this Court were to agree with you, and the California Supreme Court issued a decision looking a lot like its decision in Black, that would be perfectly valid. In other words, saying that judges can depart within this whole -- just like Booker, they can depart within this whole range, and we're going to review their determinations for reasonableness. They don't have to impose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher sentence, and we will review it for reasonableness. That would be perfectly all right.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44844 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, and that may very well be the case, but that's not what the California Supreme Court did in Black. They made no attempt. What they did was described the Determinate Sentencing Law as it has always operated.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44845 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But what they said was judges can impose a sentence in either of the three -- any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it for reasonableness. And if they don't make findings, it is going to be unreasonable, right?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44846 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, but once again, the reasonableness aspect is not what makes the system constitutional. It is the mandatory versus advisory aspect. And again, that's what made the Federal system constitutional based on this Court's Booker decision. It wasn't this engraftment of reason -- reviewing these sentences for reasonableness.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44847 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, to be quite -- to expose my thinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260 and 1261. Is that what -- the first part of that is -- it says what you said. I have no doubt. It says just what you said. But then you get over to the part, the discussion of Booker, and when they start talking about Booker, they seem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what Booker says. Now, if they are adopting what Booker says, that means, and that's why I used my example, that I guess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable, to just say the guideline, though it says thus and so, isn't right for my circumstance. And therefore, I don't adopt it. And that would be reviewed for reasonableness, his decision not to follow it. And similarly, we have cases, for example, where they're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get it right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so he adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in order -- and then makes them concurrent. Or you could have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy, and the jury found the conspiracy. It is a characterization of a conspiracy, it is very sophisticated. And I thought, well, maybe all three of those are reasons for going up in California. And I read those pages, 1260, 1261, and my honest opinion is I'm not sure.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44848 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Your Honor, I have no doubt that the California Supreme Court was trying to fit the Determinate Sentencing Law within the constitutionality of this Court's Booker system. But as far as 1261, I'm looking -- every single time they talk about Booker or reasonableness, they also make sure to give the -- to make sure that they make clear that the way the sentence -- the system works is that there's still this requirement of finding an aggravating factor.

A reasonableness constraint that requires the court to consider all the circumstances of the defendant and select a reasonable sentence in relation to those facts and those factors does not invoke the Sixth Amendment jury trial right.

We found in Booker, or at least the way the lower Federal courts have been interpreting Booker, if you use the guideline range, and you're within the guideline range, that is automatically reasonable, you don't have to worry about it. But we haven't held, and I don't believe most of the Federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the guideline range, it is automatically unreasonable. And that is the case with the California system, if you go beyond the middle range, it is automatically unreasonable unless you -- unless you find one of the aggravating facts.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44879 # TRUE # MR.

If I can use the Booker example, where you have a term of 10 years to life, the court can certainly make a selection within a reasonable range. At some point, as the court increases its sentence beyond a certain point, it will become unreasonable. We don't need to identify specifically what that point is, the guideline range or something close to it. But when you get to the end point, if there's no justification offered whatsoever for a life term --
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44880 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But the difference is, in the Federal system, the judge can go above and it can be reasonable based on facts that were found by the jury.

What it says in here is that if the -- they speak of a circumstance related to the crime, or the offender. And in a case in which no such aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose the upper term. Now, I grant you there's some language that I -- it seems to me on the next few paragraphs, seems to say something a little different. But that language, if you just take that, seems to say, unless, Judge, you find a fact about the situation that would make it reasonable to go above the middle range, you can't, under the law. Now, if that's what it says, I have to admit, I find it a little difficult to distinguish from Blakely and other cases where I dissented, but the Court's law is what the majority says. So that seems to me almost like it, unless you can tell me that I'm wrong in that.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44889 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I would say you are wrong, Your Honor, simply because California has construed its sentencing law in 1170(b) as imposing nothing more than a reasonableness --

I disagree with that. Now, there are other authorities who think that that's a little too, you know, below what it ought to be. He can simply disagree with the sentencing guidelines. Or he could point out what Justice Breyer suggests, well, the sentencing guidelines may be okay for some jurisdictions, but in this jurisdiction, we have a special problem with regard to this kind of a crime. He can do that and doesn't have to find any special fact. He cannot do that in California.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44893 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I have two responses to that, Your Honor. First of all, with regard to what the ruling in Booker was, the court's discretion has to be exercised in relation to the policy considerations set out in 3553(a), which are the same policy considerations that the court must look at, very similar in California, that there are -- the court doesn't have unbridled discretion, select any term based on whim, based on whatever it feels would be -- whatever he decides to do on Tuesday. The court has to do it with regard to the policy considerations that are inherent in what the guidelines decisions were, and what the legislature established should be appropriate sentencing considerations.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44894 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that does not necessarily mean that he must make a discrete finding of fact in order to do it. We come back to Justice Scalia's hypo a moment ago. He can go, you know, in theory, under Booker, he can go above the guideline range consistent with policy positions that may not be precise, without necessarily making discrete findings of fact. I mean, you'd have to judge it in each individual case, but the possibility is there. And under the California system, the possibility is not there.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44895 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, the systems converge at the end point. And that is, under the Federal system, going to that right end point would be unreasonable in every circumstance if there's no justification offered, other than he committed the offense. In California, because we have three discrete terms rather than a spectrum, you have the same effect when you get to the end point. It would be unjustified -- it would be an unreasonable sentence if there's no justification offered. But the fact that California has three points rather than a range shouldn't be constitutionally determinative.

And that -- obviously, there could be a circumstance where some special findings were made, in which case that might be beyond the elements. But it can't be an element simply because you shouldn't be double counting what's already established. The range is set by the elements of the offense, that all three terms are available from the jury verdict based on those elements. If you are going to make a selection within that range, it would have to be more than simply the defendant committed the offense. And that's the same with the Federal guidelines. Simply saying --
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44898 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It isn't the same in the Federal guidelines. Under the Federal guidelines, the judge could say, you know, I think this offense is more serious than what the sentencing commission thought, and these are my reasons for it. There was a dissent, you know -- the sentencing commission's determinations are reasonable, but they are surely not the only reasonable disposition. And it is open to a Federal district judge to say, well, that's what they thought, and I took it into account, and I seriously considered it, and I think they are wrong on this, I think this is more serious.

The Determinate Sentencing Law, about an upper term, is comparable to Booker's requirement that a Federal judge's sentencing decision not be unreasonable. Well, I assumed until this minute that the first statement trumped the second. But now when I see the court rule, certainly that court rule is possible, given that to be read as permitting them, particularly with the second statement, you could read the second statement as saying, yes, they can say a particular instance or a kind of sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is, in this community, so contrary to the purposes of punishment that I'm giving a higher one.

There's no indication there that the judge could just say, I think more deterrence is necessary and therefore, I'm going to exceed the base range. That's just totally incompatible with that.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44915 # TRUE # MR.

It's a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, but it doesn't aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime committed by other individuals. It's not an aggravating factor.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44923 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, the importance of our position, the central thrust of our position is that the reasonableness constraint, the constraint imposed under 1170(b) has been interpreted as a reasonableness constraint. It doesn't matter if factors are required --
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44924 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, it can be a reasonableness constraint and also be a reasonableness restraint that requires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness. The two are not exclusive.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44925 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's true, Your Honor. That's true.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44926 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And the rule seems to conflate -- seems very clearly to conflate the finding of a discrete fact. And it seems to me that we've got to consider the rule in responding to the ambiguity that Justice Breyer referred to a moment ago. The ambiguity has got to be read in light of subsection (b), and subsection (b) seems to answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the evidence. That means a fact finding.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44927 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, let me explain it this way, Your Honor, that it doesn't matter from our perspective whether or not there is a factor required in order to say that something is -- that the end point is reasonable, or if you are taking deterrence into account, that that's not -- it's not necessary for our argument because our position is that even if a factor is required --
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44928 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So do you think under subsection (b) of Rule 4.420, if a judge said, I just think the policy of deterrence requires something heavier, you think that statement by the judge would satisfy the requirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be established by a preponderance of the evidence?

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44931 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I would refer back to Black at 1255, which is the important part.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44932 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Is Black repealing the rule of court? I mean, Black -- if we refer back to Black, we get the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has raised. In order to solve the ambiguity, we look to the court rule.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44935 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, no, Your Honor, but California has construed 1170(b) as not requiring a fact-finding to move from the middle term to the upper term.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44936 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Then why didn't you give a different answer to my question? Why didn't you say, if it is reasonable for the court to conclude that deterrence really requires something tougher than the middle term, that's enough?

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44937 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I think that my answer would have to be that in relation to the hypothetical given, I was answering it because -- with regards to the circumstances of the community that the defendant committed the crime in. If we take that away --
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44938 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. Let's -- the judge, the judge is on the bench. He says, there's too much crime in our community, look at these statistics, I believe that deterrence requires something heavier than the middle tier. Nothing unusual about this particular crime. I'm making a policy decision about what the law should require in general. Would that satisfy part (b) of 4.420?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44939 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, I believe it would.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44943 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I have not been suggesting that that single factor is what makes California's law constitutional. What makes California's law constitutional is the fact that the constraint imposed on the court's discretion in selecting terms is a reasonableness requirement, just like Booker.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44944 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Reasonably -- that does not answer the problem.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44945 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I think the California Supreme Court and the California legislature would be astounded to think that this is what they have wrought. They obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the judge would apply the middle range, not using his own perception as to whether more punishment is justified or not, unless there's some circumstances about this crime that make this person more guilty, and that's what you usually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact that you believe the crime should bear -- in general, should bear, a higher penalty. I think they would be astounded to find that this is what they have created.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44946 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, let me take a step back then and say that, even with the requirement that there be some factor, putting aside deterrence as a possibility, California's system as structured, which only requires a reasonableness constraint, does not violate the Constitution. And the reason being because all it's saying is that if you're going to the absolute maximum, the farthest point on the spectrum available, if there's no justification offered, it will be reversed as unreasonable, not as unavailable.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44958 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is correct, Your Honor. Let's just take it a step back and say that what we're talking about is -- even if there are circumstances that are required, even if there are some justifications that the court must find aggravating factors, still the only constraint is reasonableness. And let me quote from what Black said about 1170(b), how it's been construed, not from the facial language, but how it's been construed. And what Black says is on page 1255 that: "Although subdivision (b) is worded in mandatory language, the requirement that an aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the decision to impose the upper term be reasonable."
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44959 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So what we have -- now, this has clarified it, but I don't know what to do. I think if I read the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the California court, which is a good court, conscientious, managing a huge system of criminal law in the state, probably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely and they see that those guidelines in California as previously understood were violated. And they're thinking, how do we maintain this system as constitutional. And therefore, they write 1261, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it, and we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it constitutional. Now, that would be an understandable judicial reaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at which point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say, because I have no doubt that your unease reflects the fact that prior to Black, in California, it would have been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on grounds other than factual grounds related to the circumstances of the crime or offender. But I also have no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the California system. All right, so now what do I do?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44960 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I think that the one thing that seems to be giving you some difficulty is the fact that California didn't explicitly say in Black, we are now officially Bookerizing our system. And the reason for that is because California had already implicitly construed the system as making all three terms legally available based on the jury verdict alone, and had simply used a reasonableness requirement. And that goes back to Hernandez, back in 1988, when California essentially anticipated Apprendi, and distinguished between making enhancements available based on the jury verdict on the elements alone, versus the three, the three components of the triad scheme.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44961 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, it is the same old record we've been playing. But the reasonableness requirement has to be explained further. And when you explain it further, you find that there must be findings by a preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances that are set out. That's different from the objectives of sentencing.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44962 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44963 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But the objectives of sentencing are not what's involved in this case.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44964 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor. And I -- whether or not the objectives of sentencing are involved is not the critical point of the constitutionality of this system. As far as California is concerned, what is important is that, first of all, the fact that the preponderance of the evidence requirement is essentially the same as what's involved in making discretionary findings within a range in the Federal system. And we're talking about the findings within a range.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44981 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, it would certainly be a big deal to California.

But it would also impose a burden of trying to identify whatever aggravating circumstances or whatever relevant considerations have to take place in this particular case, which can be a multitude of things. In California law, essentially anything can -- anything can justify an upper term sentence.

So I don't know how many cases there are on a year-by-year basis, or since Blakely or since Apprendi, but probably in the thousands, possibly.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44987 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor. And the -- once again, the important aspect, what's -- the key aspect is whether or not a term is legally available, and whether or not there's a constraint that's imposed that takes away that legal availability as a threshold matter, rather than a reasonableness review requirement. California has consistently construed 1170(b) as imposing a reasonableness requirement. This Court in Booker said that a reasonableness requirement does not limit the availability of those upper terms.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44991 # TRUE # MR. LAURENCE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Once again, Your Honor, that is not the critical component of why this system is constitutional. And that's not what we are advancing in our briefs. It's not the position that I'm arguing here, that that is what would save California's system. What saves California's system is that the only constraint imposed is a reasonableness constraint, and that reasonableness constraint, 1170(b), has been interpreted over time as simply imposing the abuse of discretion standard on the court, and that has been applied to all three terms. The middle term is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion, as is the lower term. And what is important to note is, even though the middle term -- the only reason the middle term has been given the label "presumptive" is because the court doesn't have to expressly articulate its reasons for selecting it. But it still has to do a balancing to make a determination as to what's reasonable, including the middle term.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44992 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Laurence. Mr. Gold, you have four minutes remaining.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44994 # FALSE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to respond to three items. The first is, Mr. Chief Justice, you were asking about what would be the effect in California on those that have already been sentenced. The only information I have was what was contained in Black, that only 13 to 17 percent of cases are sentenced in the upper range. But what the Court should also consider is that most -- in most cases, the difference between the middle term and upper term is really only a year. In this case, it is four years, which is somewhat unusual. So in those cases, a lot of the people will have already served their prison sentences by the time that they would be able to benefit from any result in this case. I also wanted to echo what Justice Kennedy, I believe, was saying. California Rules of Court, Rule 4.410 is just general objectives of sentencing. These are not aggravating factors. You can't take into account achieving uniformity of sentencing, securing restitution for the victims, these aren't aggravating factors that the judge considers.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44995 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, Rule 4.410(b) says that the sentencing judge should be guided by the criteria in these rules.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44996 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In sentencing, but I don't believe as far as finding them as aggravating factors, these are not facts that judges in California use to impose upper-term sentences.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44997 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No, but a reading of the rule indicates under (b), as the Chief Justice points out, that the judge could take into account these policy objectives.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44998 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, all I can tell you is that I've never seen a judge take these into account as an aggravating factor.

argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 44999 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, I think it is true that it doesn't seem to be involved in this case. In this case, we're under 4.420.

It doesn't seem to be what it means, but they get to interpret it, don't they?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 45004 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They do get to interpret how their statutes operate, Your Honor, but I believe that they are consistent in saying that this is a mandatory system. In every one of their quotes, they talk about either a judge must impose the middle term unless there are aggravating factors, or they talk about the requirement -- I was going to mention Justice Breyer's quote from Black. And even in that one, they say because an aggravating factor under California law may include any factor that the judge reasonably deems to be relevant, and then say the Determinate Sentencing Law's requirement that an upper-term sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists. They always talk about the requirement that this aggravating factor must exist.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 45005 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So it is comparable to Booker. And then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly describe Booker?
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 45006 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. And we have no doubt that they are trying to fit the Determinate Sentence Law within Booker, but Booker is about making -- the magic word, as it were, is advisory versus mandatory, not reasonableness. So yes, the California system is reasonable. And that's what the California Supreme Court is talking about --

That's the whole purpose of a guidelines system. That the individual trial judges don't get to decide, you know, how much deterrence they think is necessary, or how severe they think an individual crime is, that there's supposed to be some kind of uniformity.
argument first in 05-6551, Cunningham versus California # 05-6551 # 45008 # TRUE # MR. GOLD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Alito, there is discretion in our system. But it is the discretion to impose an upper-term after finding aggravating factors. And I think that in an indeterminate system, as you were discussing earlier, I think that that -- I'm not sure. It depends what the system is, as far as what the reasonableness constraints are.

And exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joined by Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was held fully consistent with Article III of the Constitution. This morning, you are here because an action was brought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical manufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under a license as patent royalties, under a patent it contends is invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying royalties under protest in the meantime. That complaint was ordered dismissed by the Federal Circuit as outside the Article III judicial power of the United States. In detail, the Petitioner, MedImmune, is a biotech company, formed in 1988.

KESTER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And those reasons, I would suggest, Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most part, in 1969.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44393 # TRUE # MR. KESTER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The patentee could be paying his royalties. The patentee could also be putting ads in the paper saying, "This is not a valid patent." It could -- it could have acquired a lot of publicity.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44395 # TRUE # MR. KESTER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If the licensee said, "I am not contesting that patent," that could be.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44396 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Oh, but the patentee would just say, "Look, we have a license. I think the patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit." The licensee said, "Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid, so I owe you nothing." And they settle on a license for 50 cents. Why can't the patentee say, "You know, if I get a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid, I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement expires or for other licenses"?
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44397 # TRUE # MR. KESTER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That -- I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice. But the practicality is that a patentee starts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent is valid. There is a presumption of validity. And to challenge that patent -- that presumption of validity, is a very difficult undertaking. Most of them don't bother. Why would they? If they are receiving -- if they're receiving --
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44398 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I'm trying to see how far you want -- are willing to push your argument that just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the controversy, the underlying legal dispute. And it -- I gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue the licensee.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44399 # TRUE # MR. KESTER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # A settlement does not deprive a Federal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. That's the narrow point that is before this -- before this Court.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44400 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why aren't you -- you said, "The only question before the court is jurisdictional." If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was used. It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction, shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative defense.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44401 # TRUE # MR.

But -- it happened that way in Lear, but that wasn't the reasoning of Lear. Lear would not totally cover that situation, but we would submit to this Court, it shouldn't make any difference.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44481 # TRUE # MS.

And the Government thinks there's a spectrum. One -- at one end of the spectrum would be licenses like those in Pope, and at the other end of the spectrum would be a consent decree entered after settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where the -- which included an agreement not to settle.

Now, do any of those questions have anything to do with the question before us, which is whether it is a case or controversy?

You entered into agreement, say, "Well, let's split the difference. We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a dollar or nothing." It's determined that the patent is invalid. Can the patentee then still say, "Well, you still owe me the money. We've, kind of, cut -- split the difference. That was part of the agreement"?

It doesn't have to make that injury more severe by breaching. That's clear from this Court's decision in Altvater.

It was the patent damages that put the licensee at risk, and that's the same risk that the Petitioner faces here and should not have to bear in order to bring suit.

We need to actually see what is the cause of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing, ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction. I want to start by explaining why there is no contract claim at issue here. You heard today, they're trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract. They didn't argue that below, and with good reason. And I'd just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit. Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact these are, quote, "patent-law claims," end quote, at page 27. Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the proper interpretation of the contract terms. And let me explain why. The contract terms, which were just read to you, is Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis on any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has not been held invalid by a court or other competent jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken. Now, they never said, below, "That clause means that we can come to court and have the court decide whether this patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not, then we can stop paying." And the reason they didn't make that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel. Very similar clause. The United States says, "This means that we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid." And, in an opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out of hand by -- and said, "This was a conventional proviso. We don't even need to look to evidence of the party's intent, because this is the standard proviso. It does not mean" -- and they said it was a "twisted interpretation" that the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that the licensee, quote, "thought the patent bad and would like to have the Court say so now," end quote. Yet that is exactly --

I mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that the Federal Circuit has said that, "Unless there is a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution of the United States." Now, I have to admit, I've looked up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a requirement. Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the contract. But I might be wrong about that. But you've now argued a different point.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44548 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, that is the right -- that is the right starting point for a test, depending on the cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate. In here, what the Federal Circuit properly understood is that they are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an infringement action under the patent laws. And, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to adjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement action, you have to show that you would reasonably fear that enforcement action. And, in fact, Steffel uses that language, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution. But then, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say, Are they -- is the cause of action not ripening because the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that would be cognizable coercion? That's the test that's used in Steffel for -- in essence, being able to test a -- defenses to a cause of action that --

Most fundamentally, this is a settlement. I mean, Mr. Steffel did not enter into a settlement or a compromise with the prosecutor. He wasn't complying because he was under an agreement to do so. Here, it has been settled for -- forever, that if a -- an agreement -- if you're making payments pursuant to an agreement, in the nature of a compromise, you can't come and say that it's been coerced or it's a form of duress.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44554 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why should we accept the characterization that it's a compromise? As I -- and maybe I'm just factually wrong here? I thought, at the time they entered into the license agreement, they had some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the scope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they couldn't very well be resolved. But they were -- they were not settling, in the -- in the classic sense of the word, a -- let us say, a focus claim, one against the other.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44555 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think the answer, Your Honor, is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that they could never get out of the deal. Certainly, they could repudiate and then go ahead and sue.

Supposing at the time they negotiate the license agreement there's some uncertainty about whether the patent is valid or not.

We will pay royalties in the meantime, and the -- you will accept these royalties as sufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you don't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do."

The fact is that they are making the payments pursuant to an agreement. They're not under compulsion of an injunction. They're doing it because they voluntarily entered into it. Altvater is completely different. There, there was no license agreement in force. The courts found that it -- that the reissue patents were never part of the agreement, to begin with. In other words, Altvater never agreed to pay royalties. Altvater had been sued, so there wasn't a counterclaim for invalidity.

Is it a contract action or is it a -- an action under the patent laws? Is it an infringement action?" Here, I don't think there's any question but that it is -- they're trying to adjudicate an action for an infringement that can't arise, because they're immune from suit, because they continue to make their payments.

I mean, I imagine that the very -- we see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State passes a law and the individual says, "Well, I think this is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to jail; my preferences are not to be penalized. So, my first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey it." There's no possibility in the world that he will violate that law. And yet, we've often held that, with regulations, you have to have the other requirements. You have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not just ideological, there's real harm. But, if those other requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where it said that there also has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44707 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't -- I don't think it's like violating the contract here, though, Your Honor, because, What are the consequences here? What is the choice? First of all, they actually owe the royalties under the agreement, so they're trying to escape their bargain, not enforce it. That's number one. So, they're not forfeiting any rights under the contract, they're simply trying to get out of the contract. Number two, the consequences here, the choice they're talking about, isn't in the nature of coercion. Again, they're not being arrested or prosecuted. All they're going to do if they walk out of this agreement, if they stop paying royalties -- yes, they may well be sued for infringement -- but, if they do, all they face is the loss of their discount.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44708 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But your argument seems --

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44710 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- to be based on their having implicitly given up their right to sue. Isn't that right? That was your main argument. This is a settlement. This is in the nature of the settlement. As part of the bargain, the patent holder promises not to sue for infringement.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44711 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's not based on them giving up their right to sue, in the sense that all they have to do is stop paying royalties, and they can sue. They have to --

So, what is left of this argument that what's involved here is essentially a settlement?
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44713 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it is in the nature of a compromise, Your Honor, and there's nothing in this agreement that gives them a right to sue. They have to find some legal right. What they're really saying -- what their argument has always been is that Lear actually creates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue at any time of their choosing. That's been their argument from the beginning.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44714 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, their concrete right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license fees.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44719 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I don't think so, Your Honor. I think every single contract case in the lower courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a contract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute about the interpretation of the terms. Here, what they're trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of the contract. They're trying to adjudicate an infringement action and then say, "Aha, see what I have? I have a judgment that the patent's invalid. And so, now I'd like to say that I don't have to pay royalties under my contract."

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44721 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # As a -- I do not agree that it came as a shock. And, in fact, I think that Warner Jenkinson, which is a Second Circuit case that allowed this kind of action back in the '70s, was one of the only cases ever that allowed it. And other reasons were found to dismiss similar kinds of claims. In Gen-Probe, it was a surprise that a licensee could do this. It -- the law -- by the time that this license was executed in the Federal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where the Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take advantage of the protections of Lear until it has repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it wants to challenge validity. So that was the background rule that was in force at the time of this license. And then, when you couple that with the fact that --
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44722 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that wasn't -- the District Court, in this very case, seemed to say, "I think this suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I must follow Gen-Probe." The District Court, at least as I read it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a different direction from where the Federal Circuit was before.
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44723 # TRUE # MS. MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # In all of the prior Federal Circuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties. And what the Court explained in Gen-Probe is that that is the sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish jurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge validity, if it's still paying royalties.

And I think that there's no need for a remand to do this. We are really talking about an equitable rule that has governed equitable actions for 300 years. It is a --
argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44730 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But what -- but jurisdiction is a question of power, Does the Court have the power to do this? A discretion question is different. It's, "We have the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of equity, we're not going to do so."

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44731 # TRUE # MS.

argument in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus Genentech # 05-608 # 44754 # TRUE # MR. KESTER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I believe it was. I'd have to go back and -- you mean in terms of the oral argument. It was certainly in the briefs. It was certainly not waived. There was never, of course, any -- anything in the license, or anyplace else, where Petitioner gave up the right to sue. Petitioner doesn't need permission in the license to sue. And as for the shock in the lower courts when this case was decided, I would call to your attention what the Federal Circuit, in 1983, itself, said, and it quoted the Warner-Jenkinson case, which was the Second Circuit case that my friend dismissed somewhat. The C.R. Bard case -- this is Federal Circuit, early -- starts out, the opening line -- it says, and I quote -- this is 716 F.2d 875 -- "We hold that a patent license need not be terminated before a patent licensee may bring a Federal declaratory judgment action," close quote. And the last words of the same opinion, at 882 of 716 F.2d, are, "We hold that a patent licensee may bring a Federal declaratory judgment action to declare the Federal -- to declare the patent subject to the license invalid without prior termination of the -- of the license." That was 1983. Gen-Probe was 2004. Something happened in the interval. Finally, the discussion of settlements here strikes me as, indeed, strange, because if this -- if a license were to be redesignated as a settlement, we would have the situation here where -- a license was signed in 1977; the only patent at issue in this case was not even issued until 2001.
