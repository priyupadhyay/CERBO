argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52623 # FALSE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Because title to lands underlying navigable waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty, this Court has long held that there is a strong presumption that each State receives title to such lands at statehood. Under the Court's precedents, the United States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise made that intention very plain. Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case, the United States asserts that it received title to the submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title. To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the United States identifies as ratifying the purported reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains with Alaska. Under the plain language of the statute, the proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause. And this is important. In this case it is undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included within the main clause. The submerged lands, therefore, did not

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52627 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Absolutely.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52628 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And why was Federal title to the monument not sufficient to retain title to the submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e) at all?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52629 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because of section 6(m), Your Honor. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides that the Federal Government retained all of the property it previously possessed with one important exception, except as provided in section 6. Section 6 has two exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here. Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the States. Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different set of properties. What section 6(e) did was to transfer to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of property, property that was used for the purposes or solely   for the sole purpose of   of fish and wildlife conservation under three designated statutes. Those are the State   local-State fish and wildlife conservation statutes. Again, here it was   it is undisputed that Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause. Therefore, the  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52630 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER #   problem, as   you just said that   that the main clause is very, very narrow, and we're told by the Government that no wildlife reservation would come within that main clause, so that there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52631 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The Government is incorrect, Your Honor. We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the proviso. And here's why the United States is correct on that. They argue in their brief that those properties were not included in the main clause because they were created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the Alaska Game Law of 1943. In fact, Your Honors, those are the exact same statute. The '43 Alaska Game Law simply restated the 1925 law with certain amendments. What that means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the then-existing version. These refuges were created in 1941 prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. So those are two properties. And   and actually the legislative history   we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative history because the statute is plain and also because there's a clear statement rule. But the legislative history does indicate that Congress was specifically concerned about those two very large refuges. The Kenai and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut. And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern of the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not be able adequately to manage those properties. But there was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at issue here because it was never going to be transferred to the State under the main clause.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52632 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Why   why shouldn't we look to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52633 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We are advocating the tests set out in the Idaho case, Your Honor. That test is a two-pronged test.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52636 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Whether Congress has notice of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation, which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52637 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's   that's relevant to the first prong, Your Honor. The second prong  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52638 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And second, whether the transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that reservation. Should we look to that?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52639 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If the Court were examining the   the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors might be relevant. Here, though, the test is set out in not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress. And Idaho applies that. Idaho looked very carefully for some action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that case. Here, we need an action by Congress. The United States has identified what they contend is the action of Congress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act. That proviso, though, just does not cover these lands.

It's a national park. And of course, they want to keep the whole thing. I mean, it's obvious. You don't have to write everything that's obvious. They no more want to give all the water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give the gamekeeper's part to Alaska. A house, or maybe there's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention either, but it's just obvious that unless there's something very special about the water, that the water in the park is part of the park.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52655 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there is something special about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has recognized. The water is a State   an essential attribute of State sovereignty, and just to  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52656 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I understand that. But I mean, it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're giving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's even underground water. But I mean, what the argument I think is   would be is this like that, and the argument that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need this water in order to study the glaciers because there are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora and fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's good enough. Now, what's your reply?

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52660 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But let me   let me just assure the Court. There is nothing at all unusual about State-owned submerged lands within national monuments. The reason is simple. The Antiquities Act, which allows the President to designate national monuments, was enacted in 1906. At that time there were 45 States already in the Union. Therefore, any national monument created in those 45 States would necessarily have included State-owned submerged lands unless there had been some conveyance. And let   let me give Your Honors a   a concrete example. In the 1978 California decision decided by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national monument off the coast of California, included State-owned submerged lands because even though the reservation order was asserted to have included those lands, there was no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the State's title.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52696 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If Congress really wanted to, Congress could   could affect activities relating to interstate commerce. But importantly, what Alaska seeks here really is a seat at the table. Right now Alaska has no say over anything that happens in its navigable waters which are its sovereign State lands. What it seeks really is to have its views being considered. Right now   and I'll give you a concrete example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the   in the next count that I'll discuss. For some time cruise ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside   or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of Federal laws. That was fixed, but it took an act of Congress to do that. There had to be an act of Congress to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge out in these, what they used to call, donut holes. Alaska finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress every time something comes up on its navigable waters that it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with. Now, if Congress decides to preempt the State under its interstate commerce power, it has the right to do that. I think we also need to keep in mind what waters we're talking about. This is southeast Alaska. The waters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the region. They are central to the economy, the history, the society, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live there and who travel there. Just to take an example, there are still today very few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the   the towns and the cities like the   the State capital of Juneau historically were accessible only by the water. This is an area   the water in particular is an area that is of great importance to Alaska. And they are seeking to confirm that that area does belong to Alaska. And I think we have set forth in quite detail why  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52697 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there   there are big differences between the   the analysis concerning the bays that you assert and Glacier Monument. I think they're quite different.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52700 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The tests are different. What I was trying to explain is, in answer to Your Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska. It matters quite a deal.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52703 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER #   I   I mean, is the only   you said, for example   is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52704 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There are two issues.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52705 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # How could they do that? You mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water there, but they couldn't get off the boat?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52706 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that's normally what   what people do is they just visit the

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52709 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # All right. So if   if the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat and to go up along the waterway and to look at the glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska, for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left of the park. I mean, it would be like   you see, if it's essential to it.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52710 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that's not true, Your Honor. 80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it included the submerged lands, is uplands. But it's no more unusual  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52711 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. I understand that, but I mean, it's the way of visiting the park.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52712 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, but I just mentioned, for example, the two monuments in California. The Channel Islands National Monument this Court held included the   the submerged lands were State-owned. There's no other way to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse State-owned submerged lands. In fact, I think there are few national parks in this country you can't get to without going across State lands. I think there's another important point here and that is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also allow the Federal Government to regulate activities on lands that abut national parks to the extent that they might affect park activities. But here what we need is an expressed statement by Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay. Without that, Your Honors   and the   the precedents are clear. Without that, the presumption is   in fact, the strong presumption is   that these are State-owned lands. And again, there is absolutely nothing unusual. That is part of our Federal system. It's the way that these monument properties have been managed since 1906 when the President first got the authority. It's the way that Glacier Bay will continue to be managed. We expect, we intend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government to resolve any issues that might remain. What we're seeking here, again, is a seat at the table. We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealt with because they are the owner.

The Court at pages 60 to 61 expressly stated   again, it was an assumption, but the Court expressly stated that the lands were within the main clause. Apparently the Court was considering the fact that the application for ANWR did, in fact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the main clause, the Alaska Game Law. The important point of that case for this case, though, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here, namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal Government a subset of the properties that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52720 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think what I said is that the Court embraced that position, and it was actually an essential attribute of the   essential premise for the Court's holding. At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the   the decision, what the Court made clear is it was concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso, all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was covered by the proviso. No such concern is present here. I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I might, to the count I, which is the historic waters count. There the United States asserts that at statehood the waters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated enclaves of international high seas that were wholly surrounded by U.S. territorial waters. The historical record, though, belies that contention. At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States took what this Court has described in the Mississippi Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as the publicly stated policy that the waters of the archipelago were inland and that the political boundary ran along the outside edge. Thereafter, the United States took   consistently based a discriminatory enforcement regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. What I mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52721 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the argument on the other side, as I understand it, is that the   the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is   is relevant. It has no necessary implication for the historic waters doctrine. What   what is your answer to that?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52722 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's the assertion. My answer is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975 decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202, and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief. What the Court said there is it examined an incident in which a Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general area, and the Court said   and I quote   that incident deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and, quote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the waters in question.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52723 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What   what page was that?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52724 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm sorry. That's 201 to 202   201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of the blue brief. What the law was at statehood is that the United States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign vessels. Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that is that the law has changed. The law has changed since 1971. Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a 200-mile   what's known as an exclusive economic zone that allows the United States to enforce discriminatory fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that. But   and we have quoted a UN study. In fact, the UN study that we have quoted   and that is noted at page 29 of the blue brief. That is the study that's called the Juridical Regime Study. It's the study that this Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases, has used as the authoritative statement of the law. That study quite clearly states that if a   if a country enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign vessels outside   that that manifests an assertion of an historic inland waters claim. And what we have here  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52725 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # On   on this point, it seems to me there   unlike the first point you were discussing where I think the Federal Government can work its will anyway, on this point there is really a significant Federal interest involved. That is to say, if the United States takes the position that these are, indeed, inland waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52726 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. Your Honor, they assert that, but they don't provide any specific examples. And the reason they can't provide a specific example of any instance abroad where it would affect their position is that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own facts. The fact that something is an archipelago does not render it historic waters.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52727 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But   but you say a determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply   is simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.

There has to be an   excuse me   an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before one can conclude that waters are historic waters. These ones are. Other waters would not be. The United States has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely these constellation of facts. So its   its position is basically: we say it, therefore it must be so. I

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52732 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. What the United States does, Your Honor, is follow the well-settled international law on historic bays   historic waters. Those are set forth in the convention. Each state will have the same authority where its facts and circumstances dictate it. If there has been a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the acquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as historic waters. But it has to be done based on a   an examination of the particular facts of the case. And one thing else   one thing other that is worth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a nation can always close it off using article 4 straight baselines. That is permitted under the convention. The U.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are fully able to do that. I think that if the United States is going to be arguing that there is some international precedent here that's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a particular body water abroad that it believes this case is going to affect.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52733 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Why should it make that suggestion? It would certainly not be in the interest of the United States.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52734 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it   it needs to explain more specifically then, other than just stating we think it might affect our position. The   the facts and circumstances   the Court, for example, applied the historic bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the Mississippi Sound case. I am aware of no instance in which that precedent was ever used adversely and the United States has not identified any   any instance. But more importantly, what this Court did in the Mississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it said is this a historic bay or is it not. The Court concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the Court follows. At this point, I'd like to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52753 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # To   to Alaska. Excuse me. And it's followed by another proviso which says that the United States will continue to control fish and game matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has certified that Alaska is ready to do so. Clearly that proviso is not a subset  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52754 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Minear, before you get too far, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that was raised by Justice O'Connor before. Do you agree that section 5 itself, the second part of it that says the United States retains title to its own property, that the response to that is adequately provided in the Submerged Lands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52755 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, I don't. I don't believe   let me frame the   your   your question, if I may, for you. Section 5 indicates the United States would retain all of the lands that it presently holds. Section 6(m) then makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the   to the   to Alaska. In doing so, it recognizes that there are some lands the United States would continue to retain, provided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands Act. The particular exception we're concerned about here is the expressly retained exception, in other words, if lands are retained by the United States. This Court said in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts the general law that applied before the Submerged Lands Act, that it had to be made plain that the United States would be holding onto these lands. It doesn't require an express statement. It simply requires that it be made plain. Now, our view is that these lands would be retained by the United States, quite apart from 6   the 6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary judgment. And if you denied our motion for summary judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions that are applicable. But in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e) and we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic Coast decision made clear that 6(e)   and I quote   reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote, to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife   or reservations for the protection of wildlife.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52765 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I disagree with you, Justice Scalia, for these reasons. First of all, the such transfer simply tells you what's not included. That language tells you   this is outside. It doesn't mean that whatever follows necessarily was within the main clause. What Congress was doing here, by making clear that these lands were not transferred  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52766 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # What does the such refer to?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52767 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It does refer to the transfer before. But what follows here, refuges and reservations for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within that   that main clause. It's obvious they don't because the only things that fit within the main clause are those lands and real property specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. What we're talking about here   wildlife reservations are multiple purpose lands. They're not used solely for   for the purpose of conservation. The purpose of the first provision here was to transfer vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State would need to enforce Alaska game laws. That was the point of   of that first provision. But Secretary Chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative history that what he was doing was drawing a line between those   those facilities and equipment that are used by a State in its traditional game management and drawing a contrast with the matters that would be retained by the United States.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52802 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I just need to make a point. I think it's very important for you to understand this point. First of all, that at page 57 of the Arctic Coast decision, this Court was clearly reading this language, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a clear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that these particular items that are discussed there are not a part of the main clause and cannot be. And a good example of that is the third thing that's being transferred, facilities that are utilized in connection with general research activities related to fisheries and wildlife. Now, that is not going to be something that's specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. It's the antithesis of that. It makes quite clear that our construction is correct. The subset theory just doesn't work because the items that are here are not things that fit within the main clause. What Congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52803 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But why   why doesn't (m) supersede that argument anyway? Let's   can't we say that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52804 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Then you have to explain what happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main provision. And that is because Congress was making   because this Court concluded that Congress was making clear that wildlife lands are very important and they wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not be transferred. And even a provision that could be misconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in   in Arctic Coast   could be misconstrued to contain some of these lands, we need to make adequate assurance that   that the courts that read this realize a clear division is being made. We are retaining these wildlife lands. That's  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52805 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Minear, I'm   I'm not sure I agree with you that   that that language, facilities used in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the earlier   of the earlier grant, namely property used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of fisheries and wildlife. Surely one   one can readily regard general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and protecting fisheries and wildlife.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52806 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But we're talking about a facility here. So a facility that might conduct some   some research tangentially related to wildlife is not a facility that's used for the sole   specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife. There's a clear difference here. These two   these two sets do not overlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife refuges. Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are used for multiple purposes. At the time of statehood, the   the regulations in place, the fisheries regulations and wildlife regulations, made clear that permits could be issued for purposes apart from wildlife conservation. And this Court's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized that one of the   the refuges that Alaska cites as being included in the main clause was being used for oil and gas purposes. It was not being used solely for the purposes   specifically used solely for the purposes of conservation.

As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely that other glacial forests will be revealed, and those should remain a part of the park. That was part of the purpose, was to study those

There are no roads in this park except for the park visitors center, and beyond that  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52861 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Then make it a water park. I mean, you want to say it's a   it's a water-accessible park, fine.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52862 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. But, Your Honor, the  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52863 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # 20 percent of the park is under water. Right?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52864 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # More than 20 percent. Roughly 25. I'd say close to 25 percent of the park is   within the park boundaries is submerged lands. But there's another point I'd like to make with regard to the establishment of the park. This park was created under the Antiquities Act, and under the Antiquities Act, the President is given authority to create national monuments, but they cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress. Now, Congress could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to give up the land. It could have disestablished some part of it, and it chose not to do so. And yet, that's another indication that Congress was intending to retain these lands. Now, I would like to move on to the other two counts we have here, unless we have further questions about   about Glacier Bay. But I   I think one thing that I do   one thought I want you   to leave you with with regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are essential to the park. They are understood to be essential at the time that the park was created. And the   the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one with regard to this park. Those lands are   continue to be used   the submerged lands for scientific research that is vitally important. Now, I'd like to point out that the master also correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits are historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska failed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test. This Court specifically failed to show a continuous assertion of   of sovereignty to exclude vessels that have   that are visiting the park or passing through in innocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of foreign nations. During the past 150-year period, neither Alaska nor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel based on   merely on innocent passage. Rather, Alaska   Alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we unambiguously did so. The only  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52865 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Alaska is arguing, as I understand it now, that the   the exclusion for purposes of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a matter of international law, which is a point that you disagree on. What   what is your response to their response to  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52866 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The answer is in order to establish a historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage. Fisheries is not   engaging in fishing activity under the convention is not innocent passage. And so, therefore, an exclusion based on fisheries can never   can never give rise to a claim of  
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52867 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And what's   what's your best authority for that?
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52868 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, our best authority is the convention itself. The convention makes clear under article 14 that fisheries is   that fisheries activities are not innocent passage. Rather, innocent passage is merely transit through from one point to another. Moreover, the Marguerite incident that they describe involves a single incident; that is, it does not satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland   the historic inland waters test requires. And finally, it also didn't satisfy the acquiescence test since the British Government protested the seizure of the ship. And finally on top of that, this vessel   we don't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that it was seized. There continues to be a dispute and the master was unable to determine whether that   the ship was in   inside or outside the 3-mile limit. Now, I'd also like to speak briefly to the juridical   juridical bay claim as well. This is a matter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine it would address on rebuttal. The master correctly rejected Alaska's extraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be turned into two large   large juridical bays. And basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland on an island. Now, that does not suffice the purpose of the convention. The only way that it can establish a bay headland or   or closing point is by showing that it's on the mainland. In order to establish that this is on the mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of water. And as the master recognized, these bodies of water are simply too substantial to ignore. In the case of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on average 4 and a half miles wide. It's   simply those intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish that this is   is part of the mainland. It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which is a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for international navigation. That too precludes it from being ignored and treated as dry land. The failure of those two assimilations by itself is sufficient to establish that   that these   that these juridical bays do not exist. And even if that were not enough, the master went on to say that this would not be a well-marked indentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate these lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would not be   the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is passing by. For all those reasons, the juridical bays here are   are simply not well founded, and the master was correct in rejecting them. So what we see

It had already interpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e) applied to this case. We think the Idaho provisions provide another opportunity for us to establish it. It's quite clear that the purposes of the   the lands here, the submerged lands, are so essential to the park that it's simply inconceivable that Congress would have intended for those lands to pass out of ownership. However, we relied on

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52878 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, first of all, Alaska has not moved for summary judgment. We moved for summary judgment on some of our theories. Other theories would require some factual development. One of the theories that we would   we would go forward with is that these lands are occupied under a claim of right, and that's another exception under the Submerged Lands Act. In addition, we would renew the argument with regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an area and authorizes the President to set it aside under the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain those lands.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52879 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, given the absence of a summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.
argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52880 # TRUE # MR. MINEAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. You would not have   we   we believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not think that he foreclosed it. But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's important and worthwhile. We think that this case falls squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in particular we relied on it primarily because it provides an actual textual basis for showing that the   the United States retain those lands. We do not need to go further and show purpose, although we certainly can. We relied on the Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear example of why retention is   is required in this case. The master agreed with us. He analyzed the Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the   the proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent retention clause. There's no other way to understand the Arctic Coast decision except on that basis. And we think that's the right interpretation, and we think if we   if you focus on what the Court said on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear. The statement that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test is an afterthought at the end of the opinion. It's a statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce the conclusion it's already reached. It doesn't provide a basis for   for departing from that. And in fact, as I hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't make any sense, that they're simply   all of those lands that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall within the main clause. The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple purposes. It's   the two wildlife refuges that they point to both the record shows were used for multiple purposes. They were not used solely for conservation purposes. And in addition, they were   to the extent that those refuges adverted to any lands at all   any statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not   not the 1943 statute. Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has no answer for. One   one of those refuges, in particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other areas. It clearly is being used for those purposes. We think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did intend to retain these lands. That was the point that   that this proviso, as Secretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he stated in   the excerpt appears in page   on page 47, note 37 of our brief. He stated that these reservations   the land and water would be reserved. He clearly was aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to reserve both land and water. Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back and look at the big picture here. The United States' position overall results in a very sensible division of submerged lands in this case. We have not contested Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest. Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal Government interests are paramount. First of all, with regard to drawing international   developing international principles to establish baselines, which creates these bays and   and pockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our foreign policy requires. Secondly, where the United States has clearly reserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National Park. This park was set aside for the benefit of the entire Nation. We think that the Court should adopt the master's report in full. Thank you.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52883 # FALSE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Your Honor. To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact, advocating the principles of that case. It is not sufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation that might include submerged lands. Congress has to take some action to explicitly ratify that. That was what happened in the Idaho case, according to the Court. And the United States has identified one statute and one statute only that it asserts can   ratifies the bay, and that's section 6(e), the proviso. We think the plain language to section (e)   6(e) is dispositive in this case. We are operating here under a clear statement rule. The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended that the submerged lands   title to submerged lands be defeated. There was   the statute says such transfer shall not include. There simply was no need for Congress to have included   to have specified that such transfer, the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged lands when they were not included   or excuse me   shall not include properties that were not included in the first place. That includes Glacier Bay.

argument in Alaska against the United States # 128orig # 52885 # TRUE # MR. FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, my   my first response is even the master, who ruled   who   who decided against us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60 and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within the proviso. Therefore   excuse me. The main clause. Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held that lands that did not fall within the main clause were included by the proviso. It is important, though, to   to note this, that even if the statute is ambiguous   and we think that it is not   Alaska still prevails here because a   there is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.

FRANKLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We dispute that for the following reason, Your Honor, that   that the   the point of the monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the glaciers as they recede on dry land. Title to the submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose. But I think their sky-is-falling argument really falls apart here. All that the counsel can point to is the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom. There is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would   would prevent scientists who want to study this   these lands from doing that. We let scientists onto all of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they have a good reason for doing it. We hope to work cooperatively with the Federal Government on this. The   the idea that Alaska is somehow going to be less receptive to scientific research here I think demeans our Federal structure. We have a Federal structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands is given to the States because they are viewed as the ones principally affected by the activities that go on there. We are not planning on   on preventing scientists from scuba diving down there. By the way, they did not at the time of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because there   there really wasn't any scuba diving going on. But to   to move on   I see my time is up.

Secondly, the Court should affirm the neutral principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages owing at the time interest begins to run. And third, a 1-year compliance period would be consistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and would preserve an essential right of Kansas and its farmers under this   this compact that would otherwise be lost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year accounting period. With respect to this accounting period, I would note that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court has relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, which is the standard for compact compliance in this case. In the first opinion in 1995, this Court distinguished between monthly and   and seasonal use of the model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but that seasonal reliance on the model for determining useability under article IV-D of the compact was reasonable. When the case was back here in 2001, this Court reviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a yearly basis. As you can imagine, the factors that go into calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H I Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently accurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.

I   I looked at these papers a while ago. I thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate the   the relevant amounts in the 10th year.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52420 # TRUE # MR. DRAPER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That is correct, Your Honor. It is a moving accumulation of 10 years of results.

We'd simply be taking the results that are calculated each year under either approach and use those in that year so that if you have a dry year, you are   are calculating in that year whether there is compliance and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the compact, which is to provide water when the farmers need it.

argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52444 # TRUE # MR. DRAPER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think in general, Your Honor, you are   are correct. The question about there are over deliveries by Colorado, I believe is what you're addressing, is there   is there a way to give Colorado credit for that. And there is a way. There is a   a   an account in John Martin Reservoir, which is 60 miles above the State line, for those deliveries. When they are delivered there, if there is more delivered than is actually needed in that year to achieve compact compliance, that can be retained there and, except for a small effect of evaporation, is available to offset depletions in the following year.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52445 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I   I thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.

DRAPER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Under those circumstances, the water that would be delivered to this offset account in John Martin Reservoir is not a credit that's accounted under the compact for that year. So it would not enter into the compact accounting for that year. It would not constitute a   a credit, but it would be available as a practical matter to be used as a credit in the next year for current depletions. So there would be no carryover in compact accounting.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52449 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't   I don't understand that statement.

I would point out that this is very important for Kansas farmers that the   the water be received when it is supposed to be delivered under the compact.

argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52460 # TRUE # MR. DRAPER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's what we are saying, Your Honor. And the model is inherently a yearly model. It calculates actually results on a monthly basis, and we have used it   and the Court has relied upon it   on a yearly basis up to now.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52461 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Why don't you do it on a monthly basis? Indeed, why don't you do it on a daily basis? I mean, the master found that this model really works if you   if you stretch it out over 10 years. You say 1 year. Why don't you do it month by month?
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52462 # TRUE # MR. DRAPER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it   it could be done that way, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this same model in its own administration of groundwater pumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of protecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires replacement of water on a monthly basis. So it is   it is possible. But we believe with the yearly accumulation that   that we have relied upon so far in this case and that the Court has relied upon specifically for damages, that that is an appropriate accounting period for this particular purpose. And that is   that is our proposal. The proposal of Colorado is no, let's wait 10 years before   and   and accumulate it with the other 9 years before we require any replacement. I would point out that the H-I Model, the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, is the best tool available for this purpose. It was endorsed by Colorado after the Court's first opinion in this case when it   the Court approved using the model on a seasonal basis for the seasonal accounting of useability. At that time, Colorado gave up its own model in favor of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, and as you can see from the master's report, there have been several significant improvements in the model since that time. I would also point out the correspondence   the close correspondence that exists between this case and the Pecos River litigation in the 1980's. There you had a compact that like this compact did not specify any specific quantity of water in the compact itself, but indicated that there was to be no depletions beyond the depletions that were occurring at the time of the compact with a few small amendments that I could   I could mention. But the basic similarity of the compacts is that the status quo at the time of the compact was maintained. There was an inflow/outflow relationship that needed to be observed and was required to be observed by the compact. It was expressed explicitly in the Pecos River compact by a reference to an inflow/outflow method. In this case, it was expressed implicitly in article IV-D of the compact.

Colorado # 105original # 52463 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The master found that the role of the river master in the Pecos case was quite different than the role of the river master you want to have appointed here.

DRAPER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. if   if you refer to the appendix of our   our blue brief, on page A-22, you will see that the opening section of the Pecos River master's manual sets out the inflow/outflow relationship that is to be observed in complying with that compact. This is the form of an equation. You can see y equals and a   and a number there. In   in our case, we have the   the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, which benefits from several decades of increased sophistication in hydrologic analysis to do the same job.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52469 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The Pecos master can simply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results that the compact requires?

DRAPER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # He   he is to apply the formula, Your Honor, but there's a great deal of judgment, professional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised in order to apply it. For example, you have to separate flood flows from base flows. When you look at the   at the results of a   of a gauge on a river, you can see how much water was in the river at particular times, but this has to be separated into two different kinds of flows that are treated differently under this compact.

We   perhaps he was thinking of the settlement that we have achieved on the Republican River. That case started, was accepted by this Court. After rulings by this Court, it became possible to settle that case. It has now been settled. And the States involved in that litigation were Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. It was possible in that   in that context. It has proven impossible in this context. And we can expect disputes to go on, as they have over the last century, if we do not have an impartial expert authority to resolve disputes between States that are going to come up every year. Every year there are questions. How do you take the data this year and put it into the H-I Model? While many of those issues have been settled, because different forms of replacement and other different circumstances arise, you have those every year. And if you follow the lead that the Pecos River cases of this Court give us, there is also the possibility to address the improvement of the tool for implementing the agreement of the States, and that is improving the Hydrologic-Institutional Model on occasion, as we have seen the master do over the course of this litigation. That is allowed under the Pecos River Decree, and we submit that it should be allowed under this decree as well. And that is when the master would be exercising the most judgment in our opinion. I would conclude by saying that a   a river master is needed on the Arkansas to deal impartially and expertly with annual questions that must be resolved to implement the H-I Model, and that a 1-year compliance period will implement the intentions of the drafters of the compact and the needs of Kansas farmers and is consistent with the yearly reliance that this Court has already placed on the H-I Model. I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if there are no further questions.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52517 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Very well, Mr. Draper. Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52519 # FALSE # MR. ROBBINS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I will begin by discussing the river master since that's where Mr. Draper left off. I want to make it clear, first of all, that I disagree with the assertion that the Pecos River Compact and the Arkansas River Compact are similar in the way they operate. The Pecos River Compact did, in fact, specifically state that it was   it intended to hold the level of   of depletion of the system by man's development to the 1947 condition. The Arkansas River Compact, to the contrary, begins the   the limitation clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas Basin, provided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use for the uses. So the   the Arkansas compact contemplated that there would be a   a more flexible effort at using the water of the river by water users in both States, protecting the existing uses in both States from that future development. Now, this   this Court has appointed a river master in two circumstances. In both circumstances, as pointed out by Justice Ginsburg, the   the special master recommended that because of the specific circumstances of the case, that in fact a river master was appropriate. That was on the Delaware River and the Pecos River. In all other cases that deal with this issue where requests have been made by   by States without river   without a special master's recommendation, the Court has declined to appoint a river master. There's a very good reason, I think, behind that. Colorado alone is the party denying interstate compacts in two equitable apportionment decrees. If every time a State is dissatisfied with its neighbor, is dissatisfied with how a compact operates, it is able to come to this Court and say, please appoint a river master, we're just having trouble with our neighbor, you'll become the water management   the super water management agency for the country. You have river masters if you   it's totally up to   to your discretion. But if you were to follow this line of thinking, you end up supervising water distribution across the west and part of the east.

argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52538 # TRUE # MR. ROBBINS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I want   I want to make it very clear to the Court that the State of Colorado, different than the situation in the Pecos River, acted very aggressively to ensure that it promptly came into compliance with the   with the determination that in fact depletions were occurring, impermissible depletions were occurring to the Arkansas River. Within 2 years, the State of Colorado's legislature had passed the appropriate legislation. The State engineer had passed rules and regulations, implemented them, and enforced them. The State had authorized millions of dollars in loans for the acquisition of replacement water, and   and the State of Colorado   your   your ruling was in 1995. By 1997, it appears that the State of Colorado was in compliance with the compact. That is a significant and very difficult effort on the part of the legislature, the Governor, the attorney general, and the State engineer. We do not believe that this is anything like the Pecos River. Your master in this case has not said to you these parties are   are torn, will not get together, and you need to have a master, a river master, appointed. In this instance, the State of Colorado took the exact opposite approach. They did everything they could to reduce the pumping of the wells sufficiently to allow Colorado to meet the terms of the compact, and that is an important fact you need to glean from the special master's report. Now, the   the other   the only other point I want to make on this is that the   the   it's   it's very important, in deciding whether or not a river master is the appropriate course of action to determine   and I   I mentioned this earlier   whether or not the Court wants to be in a supervisory position. I happen to agree that the States are entitled to seek redress of their concerns before this Court, and as you said in   in Oklahoma v. New Mexico, you have a serious obligation to adjudicate disputes between the States where there are actual and existing controversies. And   and the fact that you would have a river master would not eliminate the potential for those controversies. In our view, the only way that you can get this matter off of your plate and into the position that Congress recognized and   and directed is to follow the special master's recommendation number 12. I'd now like to turn, if I may, to the issue of the accuracy of the model.

Under the   the master's formulation, which is agreed to by Colorado, the damages which occur in each year, 1950 through 1984, are   are computed at   in   as nominal damages in the year in which they occur. They are then expanded by the   by an inflationary formula which allows the dollar in 1950 to be calculated in a 2002 dollar. In 1985 and to the present, any damages that occur are advanced both for inflation, but then they are also awarded a prejudgment interest, which is compounded. In other words, if inflation is 2 or 3 percent through the period on a long-term average, but   but investments are at 6 or 7 percent

argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52574 # TRUE # MR. ROBBINS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT #   those damages advance. Colorado's   Kansas' view is that commencing in   in 1985, all of the damages from 1950 to the present should receive prejudgment interest. The difference then becomes, if you use the master's methodology, the   the current amount of money in 2002 dollars which Colorado would owe Kansas is approximately #29 million. If you use the Kansas methodology   and this is the impact of prejudgment interest   it would be #52 million. Under the original formulation that was presented to the Court, the value under the master's formulation, which did not charge prejudgment interest on the '50 to '68 dollars, both States agreed that that would have been #38 million. So from Colorado's perspective, having succeeded in our   in our exception that the year should be 1985 instead of 1969, we in fact, under the Kansas theory, lose some #20-some million in the proposition, which we don't believe is what the Court intended. Let me   let me turn very quickly to the model, if I may. The   the issue here is not Colorado's obligation to deliver water to   to the river system. Colorado has both senior surface water rights and the State of Kansas that it has obligations to protect. Remember, the compact envisions that this subsequent development can't injure water users in either Kansas or Colorado. As a result, Colorado must ensure that on a monthly basis, water is placed into the river so depletions are   are compensated for in the system as they occur. The problem here is not that process. The problem here is a model that is inaccurate. Beginning in your first report, you quoted with favor the special master's comments about this model in dealing with the winter water storage program, which was an issue which you agreed should be dismissed several years ago. You indicated that depletions shown were well within the range of error and it could not be told if it was an impact or an error that the model was describing.

We believe that the model over a long period of time, as it's developer, Mr. Durbin, said, is reasonably accurate. We   we agree with that, and we are willing to use it like that. But that means you have to use   look at it over extended periods of time. Our view is that you simply look at the model, which is predicting over-deliveries and under-deliveries, predicting them. They don't have any relationship to what Colorado is really putting into the system. They are predictions. And in some years where you   where you look back and you know from the gauges the model is over-predicting a significant amount, you   you want to be   and you know in a subsequent year it's going to under-predict, you want to allow that to smooth out so that you are, in fact, getting close to what's really going on. It is not an effort to carry dry-year depletions into wet years or vice versa. It is, in fact, an effort to allow the model's inherent inaccuracies to play out so that you get a more accurate result in each 10th year.

And in fact, it is with respect to any one year that's important under the compact. In other words, they   they plan every year, not every 10 years.

argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52593 # FALSE # MR. FELDMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # None # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's the position of the United States that   that we agree with Colorado and with the special master that a river master should not be appointed in this case. The compact between the States of Kansas and Colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for implementing the obligations in that compact, which has to do with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount of water to Kansas. The commission is also charged with investigating violations of the compact, and the compact includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to binding arbitration if the   the States agree to that. The   the commission also certainly could use other dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the authority to do if it wanted to. The States have agreed to that. Congress has enacted it into law, and this Court should permit the parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that might arise in the future rather than putting a river master in place under the authority of this Court. Now, the Court has   itself has frequently stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort is preferable to litigation. As the special master pointed out, in the two river basins just north of the Arkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River, the parties recently, after having a dispute, including these very same two States in one of them, have come to a consensual resolution of the dispute that they had. And I think that does show, as the special master pointed out, that these   the States can   in fact, the disputes in those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect of well pumping, among other things. As the special master pointed out, I think that shows that the States can use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and this Court ought to continue its often-stated preference for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to problems of this sort. If the Court were to appoint a river master in this case, then I think the question would arise in any future case in which you have two States that have conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity, as what happened with river compacts, equitable apportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an inherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree or judgment. And I think rather than   that   that would be directly contrary to the Court's other statement in the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and that it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions, but also that the Court does not favor appointing agents or functionaries to carry out its decrees.
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52594 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # NA # None # So I guess we made a mistake with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other one? Delaware?
argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado # 105original # 52595 # TRUE # MR. FELDMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # None # Yes. The Pecos River   I mean, there were a couple of differences, in addition to the ones that Mr. Robbins pointed out. One difference is that not only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos River case   neither party objected to the appointment of a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of clothing the master with authority to make determinations that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous standard. In this case, there is a party that objects to it. And I would   I think there's another difference that's important that the Court ought to keep in mind. At the time the Pecos River master was appointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which the Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide for this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and the Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the   it provided that the river master in that case would be reviewed under that standard. As of 2003, rule 53   it's now rule 53(g)   provides that masters appointed by district courts said their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo standard unless the parties agree otherwise. Therefore, at the present time   and again, following the Court's rule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be guides   and I think they are a useful guide   the appropriate course here, if the Court were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one whose findings will be reviewable de novo. But that itself raises problems because if the findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's really just a continuation of the current litigation and it doesn't really advance things any. The parties will submit the evidence to the river master. He'll make his determinations, and then they'll come to the Court. That's really more what the special master does at the current time. So I think that under all of those circumstances, both the Court's preference for a consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the Court's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to decide cases of this sort and it can't   it's not the obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission that Congress has put into place specifically to deal with this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute resolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a river master in this case. As far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's the position of the United States also that the special master and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest should not be awarded. I think it's a familiar principle in   to this Court in litigation that if a party   when the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all of its objections if it wants the Court to hear them. In this case, the special master came up with a recommendation in his third report about how to   what should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the early years   the   the amount of the damages in those early years would never be subject to prejudgment interest. Now, Kansas objected to that and said we should move the year back to 1950. We should get prejudgment interest on everything back to year one. But they never made the objection that if you   if the Court disagrees with that, which it did, that the method that the master had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969 was incorrect. That was the time that Kansas should have brought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.

So, in essence, Kansas is getting a portion of what the prejudgment interest would normally cover for those early years. I think if all that's put together, I think the Court's conclusion that the master's conclusion was just the amount that equity dictates was correct, and that if Kansas didn't like that, it should

The reason that we didn't do that is because we filed an exception last time against every respect in which the special master was not recommending full interest. And it turned out that the Court chose the   the test that we now have, which is a relatively easy test to apply. It has certain incentives that grow out of it that make sense. And we believe that we sufficiently excepted to that. If look at our brief from that exception, the one in   in support of our exceptions, in particular   particularly to page 25, footnote 8, we specifically addressed the issue that the   the master was not allowing any interest in that 1950 through 1968 period.

And I would point out also that the only reason that it was done that way   and the calculations of the parties did   did in connection with that review   is because the special master required it. There is no other reason that we did it. We did not volunteer to do it that way. We did not like doing it that way. The master said that's the way it's going to be in my recommendation. How much would that amount to? We did not agree in any way to that part of the calculation. I would also point out that with respect to the amounts involved, that you need to be careful.

MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to turn first to the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the term "willfully" and its determination that the case had to be remanded for further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore Petitioners' communications with their counsel. We ask this Court to find that there is no necessity for any such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege because summary judgment should have been affirmed in this case. Petitioners and their counsel, if you think about what communications you might find, they could not have known anything more about these statutory issues of first impression than the district court did. It's questions of law. And if the district court's opinion does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the, of the FCRA. The first   the Ninth Circuit nevertheless reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to go ahead and look at privileged communications if the Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully. And the first is that they read willfully in this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several cases where this Court has read the term willfully in civil statutes to mean recklessly. But this Court has said repeatedly that the word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used to determine whether it means with knowledge that your conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations are sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike the other three that were at issue, Congress has used the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean, as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that their conduct violates the Act.

If you look at Section 1681h, it actually provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions that are carved out in 1681n. And so I think it was to make clear, I think it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a willful intent to injure. So even if they meant it to be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just surplusage. It was to clarify that they didn't have to have a willful intent to violate.

But that the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used here in this setting, where there is the potential for very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to   Farmer versus Brennan calls it "criminal," the criminal recklessness standard.

MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Except Screws, Your Honor, actually says that it was adopting a criminal recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a reckless standard. And that is the same standard that has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully in the punitive damages context. So I think it's exactly the same standard in that Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't just be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad purpose to violate clearly defined rules. And this Court has said in various contexts in the, in the qualified immunity area that picking the losing side does not mean that your conduct was objectively, you know, wrongful. And that's really   I think that there is great significance to the district court's ruling. I'm not saying that in every case, it would absolutely be dispositive. I think you have to look at what was the, you know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning of the district court. But what the Ninth Circuit did is that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on creative but unlikely answers to issues of first impression. Well, if an administration official goes to a lawyer in the administration and asks about a course of conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue of first impression, there is probably a 40 percent chance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed on that basis?

That is what this Court has held in a number of cases that have similar uses of willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have held. Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the three that have been most discussed in the case, in the papers here. But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here was in the application of that standard. And in particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it concluded that a creative but unlikely position constitutes recklessness, it erred. Recklessness speaks an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care. It requires that the defendant act in the face of or fail to act

MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, to the extent you're talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's true. I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury that could result, can   we'll tolerate less risk. If the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to somebody, we'll   the law will tolerate a lesser degree of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or maybe even a dollar injury. And it's not set. It's a variable calculation. So in that sense, it is. I don't think that when we talk about a high and objective risk in this context, we are talking about the dollars that a, that a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers. What we are talking about here   and this is a very unusual statute the way it's written   the liability itself, not just the damages, but the liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from law. You have to   there is no recovery here like there is in almost   or commonly in Federal statutes for just a violation. That isn't it. You have to show either a willful violation or a negligent violation, and that requires a determination not only that the defendants violated the law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how many standard deviations from correct their position was and that is an objective determination. Once an objectively high risk has been found by a court, then   then the case can shift to looking into subjective things. I think a plaintiff would be entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to infer the existence of willfulness from that. And that's often when defendants   I'm sorry.

MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right. It's a complicated answer, in part because that assumes that you have an existing account and you're not an initial account here. And when you have an existing account, there's a definition of adverse action for insurance provisions, but in iv there is a separate, there's another definition, and this is on, on page   sorry. Excuse me. On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under big I   I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions   talks about reviewing an existing account, and it cross-referenced another provision which talks about reviewing an account for purposes of termination. And that would include, in our view, not only completely canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. So which would govern in that particular context is a little bit harder. But it could, and here's logically why, because I think the understanding of "increase" that's at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation of this statute, and that is, did the content of your information in your credit report, if it had been better, could you have had a better rate or a better deal.

You put it in and you give people the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you know that maybe there could have still been a better rate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to send notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's basically the argument. So what's your response?

They have ranges and most of them will have a top tier. They may have specialized things for employees, but putting aside a specialized category, there's a top range and they will tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15 percent of people fit in there. So they know what the best rate is. They know what the next, above average rate, the standard rate.

No. Is it an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance? Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any insurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into that language.

It did not do so in connection with the claims here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A). In each instance where Congress wanted to allow   to require a higher mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with liability that was greater. They required knowing mens rea for the criminal provision. They required knowing mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages that are available under the act.

Little n used the word "willful" just as it does now, suggesting that willful would not include gross negligence or something close to gross negligence like recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed whatever it always was, and if the argument from contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was changed to negligence in o.

But that still doesn't tell us separately what "willful" meant, and of course "willful" had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless disregard. And I respectfully disagree with

Ms. Mahoney # 06-84 # 52318 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I mean, there's no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context. But we also keep repeating, you know, "willful" is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context. And here the argument is that if you look to the context of the, of the two statutory sections right up next to each other, you can draw a, an inference about what "willful" means.

SHORR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think if anything, Justice Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly required the knowing standard and that's a knowing violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. And the statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is under this law. So that reference to knowing could not refer to a knowing, knowing the facts. And of course, willful in some sense always includes some knowledge of the factual circumstances. In addition, the logical structure of the act   as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual damages. We have a reckless standard, a knowing or reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but then an even higher level for the criminal and higher statutory penalty provisions. And as I started to say, a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and other similar cases.

That is, if you look at the language, as you've just heard, if you look at the purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an instance where a person has continuous accidents. He's a reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in just a category below the bottom and they read his credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he always pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not to the top category, but they give him a much better deal. And you're saying this statute means that what I just described is an adverse action based on a credit report?

We get them every day, dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, because they will become meaningless because to an average person that notice will not mean that he better look at his credit report.

In every case in which the consumer might have done better if the credit report had assumed different facts, on your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say I want to look at that report and correct it if it's wrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the fallacy of saying because that is one object of the statute, every term within the statute has got to be read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that object? And the trouble that we're having on the bench is that discrimination and increase are different terms. Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination does not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the basis of your argument?

So I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and that's about 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't have the best possible credit score. Now I take it that means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that, since it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people. And if that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out notices. And that's why I asked my question about the boy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive, that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on that?

The   as an initial matter, it's not the perfect credit that is the standard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's best rate. And that's a much broader standard. We don't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA 6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six. And of course not everyone is going to get the notice. If your driving record totally eliminates   if you have great credit but your driving record eliminates the possibility that you qualify for the better rate, you wouldn't get notice in that circumstance either. But the key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but the information that the insurance company looks at is incorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect information without ever having the opportunity to tell the insurance company or whoever is collecting that information for them, you've charged me the wrong amount and I in fact qualify for that better rate.

But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving notice at a critical time, when the insurance company tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an adverse action. I wanted to also mention, here it's not just an increase. There's also been a denial, and that Mr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied insurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so that is also an adverse action under the act.

And the problem is, Congress has always told that there is significant inadequacy in the credit information. I think it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center brief. In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate in consumer information was 50 percent and there was a 20 percent serious error in the rates. Under GEICO's interpretation

MAHONEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If I could start by just responding to the issue of the new document, I just want to emphasize that this document was created by people who weren't lawyers. It was done before GEICO even started using credit to price insurance. They were   said they were brainstorming about what the statute might mean. And I would point the Court to the supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO implemented the policy that we're talking about here, the   they said that the intent was that we would send to the people who were supposed to get the adverse action notice. With the early systems development we didn't have the ability to identify whether they were supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because they had not yet developed the way to do with what they call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't taken credit into account at all. And this is a procedure that's required actually in most States in order to ensure that those who don't want to allow access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning of those State laws, and that means worse than the average loss ratio. So there's nothing in this record, even if you take into account the documents they're talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law. With respect to a few of the factual or   issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately 80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new insurance to now have to get notice under the standards established by the Ninth Circuit. With respect to who can qualify for the top tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO, approximately 10 percent. So 90 percent of the consumers would not qualify for that. And the statute very plainly does not prohibit differential treatment based on persons with better credit, nor do State laws. And so the analogy as to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you can't treat any person of a different race in a different way, and that's not true under this statute. And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't   if we're treating you worse than we would have treated you if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll send you the notice.

argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52041 # FALSE # MR. FARR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that it wanted the Department of Labor to define the boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship services exemption. And I think that has two important implications for this case. First of all, when the Department has filled in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as they are permissible implementation of the statute. Second, and particularly specific to this case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one. And here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by far the most sensible one. Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to the second issue first, because I think that's the source of a lot of the concern in this case. Plainly the two regulations, section 10   552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down the present regulation, have some inconsistency between them. But it is also plain that the Department could not have intended to say at one and the same time that the only employers entitled use the exemption were homeowners and then say in another section promulgated at the same time that also third-party employers are entitled to the exemption. So the question is, how does one resolve this apparent inconsistency? And the Secretary says, well, the only regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals specifically with the issue of third-party employment is 552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party Employment. And that section 552.3, while containing some language that might be read to address that issue, in fact deals with several other topics. Specifically it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are involved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs, footmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in a private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in the private home of the person receiving the services. So it's not enough, for example, for somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby sitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the house of the person receiving the services.

FARR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, essentially reading them to say they, they were not intended to address directly the subject of third party employment which is the subject addressed in 109(a). And I think if one is   even leaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary for a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking about making a fair resolution of these conflicting provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first thing that one would do is apply the canon that the specific provision controls the general. And if one looks at the two provisions, section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing and one thing only: that is third party employment. And it says explicitly and straight out that persons who are employed by third-party employers are   or third-party employers who employ persons performing domestic services are entitled to the exemption.

The   of course that doesn't address anything beyond companionship services, of course, because there is not an exemption beyond that. And that's one of the interesting things about 552.3. In addition to generally dealing with this question of what kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion of the exemption for companionship services, because jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not subject to the exemption. So it really looking at what 552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that   at the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as well. And the Department has taken that position. It says this is, in fact, the only definition of domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it is not just intended to be limited to the particular situation of the exemption. It applies more broadly than that to coverage as well. So I think in all those senses, Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3 deals with a number of other subjects. Now, one other thing on the statutory interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that Respondent offers also leads to the problem that essentially sets up a tension with another one of the regulations which is 552.101(a). 552.101(a) which I'm sorry   I don't have the right page number here   it is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition   has, carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to. But then it also says that this includes people who are commonly referred to as private household workers. And the one thing we know from the Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and also from what the Department has said before this Court is that that term at the time was defined by the Department and known by Congress to constitute more than just employees employed by the homeowner. There was a special second category for people who worked in the home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but were employed by a third party agency. Now somewhere underlying all of this question, I think, is statutory interpretation and indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to employees who work for third parties. And I would just like to suggest that there really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have wanted that. First of all, third participate employers such as private agencies provide services for the particular group of people which Congress was trying to assist with this exemption. People who by reason of age or disability are unable to care for themselves. Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the background screening for employees. They can provide necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents and things like that. So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit unusual.

The report uses the term private households workers frequently interchangeably with the term domestic employees. That is what is clear from the report itself. Now, the Department of Labor when it was reporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to do, the Department of Labor used the term private households workers, specifically defined in there by the Department, to say this means not just employees employed by the homeowner but also people who are employed by third parties. So I think it is a fair assumption that when the Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it in the same manner that the Department of Labor reports have. And, in fact, at one point in the   moving further backward in the legislative history, Senator Dominick actually quoted that language, the definition from the Department of Labor, on the Senate floor during the debates.

I mean one of the difficulties here in answering that is that I think, because the Department has such broad authority under 213(a)(15) to define and delimit the term, I think what's consistent with the statute has expanded somewhat. On the other hand, I have to say I don't really see where there would be in the language of the statute any basis for drawing a distinction between different kinds of third-party employers. The phraseology in the coverage provisions, the phraseology in the exemption provisions, really doesn't allow for that in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation.

Covered enterprises beginning in 1974 includes state and local governments. So what Congress would have been addressing here, if it had been squarely facing the issue, would have not just been the question of how to treat large and small corporations, but whether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered enterprises such as state and local agencies who, in fact, do provide a lot of the direct employees who provide companionship care. They have a lot of employees who actually go into homes and care for people who are employed by state and local governments. And I think it would be a little bit unusual for Congress, who is reasonably solicitous of state interests, to deny them an exemption that would have been of considerable importance to them. As the State of   or the City of New York brief points out, this is a very extensive endeavor.

argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52085 # FALSE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The FLSA's companionship services exemption applies by its terms to any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for the aged or infirm. The Act imposes no limitation based on the identity of the employer. And the Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the exception to employees of third parties is entitled to deference. The Department expressly invoked its statutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109, 552.109. It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking procedures both in 1975 and each time it considered amending the regulation. And States and care providers have relied upon it in devising systems to provide appropriate services to the aged and the infirm.

argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52087 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, I don't think so, Your Honor. If you're referring to the initial proposed rulemaking that would have exempted only some third parties, we think that would have been a permissible reading of the exemption given the fact that the Secretary is provided very broad defined limit authority. But we certainly think there's nothing in that exemption that precludes the construction that's been adopted here. In fact, we think it is the most consistent with that language. The language of 5523 upon which Respondent relies does not change that conclusion. While if read in isolation that language could require that domestic service employees have to provide their services in the home of the employer, it should be not   it should not be given that reading for the reasons explained in the Department's 2005 advisory memorandum. The Department's construction of its own regulations contained in that memorandum is itself entitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and its construction harmonizes the various provisions at issue here far better than Respondent's reading of 553 does.

SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct, and that's tied to a specific term that only applies to the exemption as to babysitters. The only thing that's exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a casual basis. Congress certainly could have included a casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption for companionship services. We think it's very notable that it did not and we read from that that Congress wanted all domestic service employees providing companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those individuals who most need this type of care have the opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.

argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52091 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we think that that is the consequence of the companionship services exemption, but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is and based on the textual difference between, for example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the exemption for companionship services. The exemption here expresses no limitation based on the identity of the employer and we think it was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that what Congress had in mind here was a categorical exemption based on the type of services that are being provided; and while that may mean that there are certain workers who are now exempt who were not previously exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in 1974 focused on this problem of companionship services being provided to those who cannot care for themselves; and we think that follows from the text, and for the reasons Congress adopted that.

I think that there are a variety of things that point to the conclusion that the language in 552.3 that refers to "in the home of the employer" simply cannot be read literally. It was borrowed from the Social Security context and if read the way Respondents do we think would raise a serious question about the scope of coverage because the agency has always viewed 552.3, notwithstanding the initial line that says "For purposes of the exemption," to provide the relevant definition for coverage as well. And no party, or amici for that matter, before this Court nor the Department thinks that there's a difference between the identity of the employer for purposes of coverage. And we also think, given the language in 101 that refers to private household workers, the definition of which was provided to Congress in a report by the Department of Labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum in 2005, which clearly applies to third party employers, suggests that 553 cannot be read literally. And of course we know that at the same time that the agency adopted 552.3 it felt the need to adopt a specific regulation dealing with the question of third-party employment which would not be relevant   which would not be necessary under Respondent's reading. If the Court has no further questions

argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52104 # FALSE # MR. BECKER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: On October 1, 1974, just five months after the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took effect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated law-making function to define this term "domestic service employment," which exists in the companionship exemption and nowhere else in the amendments. And they defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to companions and baby sitters employed by the household. At the same time, DOL provided a persuasive explanation for that definition. The Department found that such companions and baby sitters when employed by covered enterprises had been covered prior to the amendments and that it could not have been Congress' purpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to extend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage. The very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of the amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act. Therefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974 that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny the Act's protection to previously covered domestic service employees. The definition in 552.3, which expressly applies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with the final third-party regulation.

The importance of the conflict is twofold. One, when the original regulation was proposed the Department provided a persuasive explanation. Congress surely didn't intend to contract coverage in amendments designed explicitly to expand coverage.

argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52127 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It doesn't say that. It says "about, in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed." I live in San Francisco. My mother lives in Massachusetts. Now, if I hire a companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom she is employed. So if we're being literal and if you win this case, I don't see how   and I'm worried about this, obviously   however   and I think it's probably very common, that all over the country it's the family, the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so they don't have to be brought to an institution. And if you win this case, it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who will move to institutions. Now, if I were to say that that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a legal point because it's a question of what people intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the truth.

And the second way the situation could be dealt with is by the Department of Labor. They could look at their regulations and say, the industry has changed and therefore, in a way which could certainly be consistent with Congress's intent because it would not be withdrawing coverage from a previously covered employee who was employed by an enterprise, we could say that the exemption applies to companions and baby sitters employed by private individuals, including the homeowner, the son or daughter, etcetera.

However, we know several things about Congress in 1974. We know that the enterprise coverage was relatively new. They adopted it in 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these very amendments in 1974. So Congress was aware of the prior coverage. We know that the Department of Labor, in the very reports which have been cited by the petitioner, stated both in January of 1973 and in January of 1974 in their reports to Congress on the Act, stated that there was prior coverage of domestics employed by third parties. We know there was enforcement activity by the Department of Labor against such third-party employers. So while the industry has certainly changed, there were enterprises who employed domestics, including companions, in 1974, and Congress was aware of it and stated over and over again in the preamble, in the committee reports, which indeed, the House committee report said, "Our intention is to expand the act to the extent of Federal power."

There is an important difference, and that difference is the word employment. Now that's important for several reasons. Number one, of course, coverage provisions are to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly. So there's an additional word that can and would suggest it should be read as a term of limitation. Number two, that difference must be given significance, if possible. The word should not be read to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it doesn't exist in the coverage provisions. And number three, we should avoid redundancy. There is a reading of that unique language, "domestic service employment", which makes sense and in fact, is exactly the reading given by the Department.

What I'm suggesting is if that word, that phrase, "domestic service employment", is given the definition which the Department of Labor itself gave it, it avoids reading two phrases which are different to mean the same thing.

One, it is the regulation, which no one disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the Department's law making function. The Department expressly defined and delimited its term "domestic service employment" in 552.3 and expressly said it was not doing so in the third-party regulation.

One, it avoids reading a term in the statute, not only a term in the regulation but a term in the statute, completely out of the statute. And that is the term "employment". Secondly, as the Department found, it is consistent with what was Congress's clear intent, to expand and not to contract coverage. Thirdly, if one looks at the debates, and there was extensive and vigorous debate about these amendments, the exclusive focus in Congress was the household. The opponents were exclusively concerned with the extension of coverage to the households. So applying the exemption to protect only household employees is wholly consistent with what was Congress's exclusive

I'm assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference. And you have two regulations that are conflicting. Now, how do you decide which one prevails?

The agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations.

argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52158 # TRUE # MR. BECKER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Let me answer in several ways. First, this Court has clearly held that an agency does not have unbounded discretion to construe its own regulations. When the terms of the regulations are unambiguous, they cannot be construed away. Now here

Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, they were the mistake. One or the other had to be the mistake. We decided it was this one. Why shouldn't we take their word on it?

There's a difference between conflict and ambiguity. The words are unambiguous, and it's not simply the   there's two sets of words which they attempt to read out of the regulation, one of the unambiguous words that require employment by the person who's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory language which says the regulation only applies to the exemption. So in the guise of deference, the Solicitor General and the petitioners actually suggest to this Court that it should take apart the regulation and ignore two of its three operative provisions.

It was thinking in effect the following: We have the power to issue a regulation here that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to go through the procedure that would be necessary to issue such a regulation. But we're not invoking that power here because we want this interpretation which we think is the correct interpretation of the statute not to be followed   not to get as much deference from the courts as it would if we were invoking our power.

The Petitioner would suggest that we're relying on simply a label, this is in the interpretive section and the other is in the general regulation section. Far from it. We are relying on a very clear statement both in the regulations, 552.2(c), as well as in both the proposed regulations and the final regulations, which clearly state that only those in Part A define and delimit. Why is that an important distinction? It's an important distinction because Congress clearly meant these two grants to be different. Otherwise, why would it have granted an express power to define and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of the general rulemaking authority?

These are regulations that don't even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute, but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas, to say the   this rule won't apply to companies over this   that can't possibly be an interpretation of the statute. So Congress says we're going to give the agency that authority. In addition, of course, we're going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has, which is to interpret   interpret the language of the statute.
argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52172 # TRUE # MR. BECKER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I think we can safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these two types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the law. And this Court, if you compare its decision in Addison to its decision in Skidmore, clearly itself distinguished between the exercise of those two different interpretive or rulemaking authority. Clearly in Addison, construing a very similar term in a different exemption, giving the Department of Labor the power to define a particular term in the exemption, said that is law making authority. And we will follow what the Department of Labor says unless it's clearly inconsistent with the statutory   with Congress's intent. In Skidmore, where that type of expressed delegated law making authority to define and delimit was not at issue, the Court said we will record only that degree of deference to which the regulation

It is an exercise of the power to define the term and I don't think we can take that language "refers to" to be non-exclusive. When the Department said referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it was. If we have any doubt about what the Department intended, it actually of course reiterated that definition under the interpretive classification. And it again said that the term refers to, is defined as, employment by the household. If we had any doubt

BECKER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I'm referring to an earlier provision of the same regulation, not the reference to private household workers, but where it states that the definition includes those individuals who are employed by the household, that is in 552.101(a). But if we had any further doubt, the   that regulation refers to, as its source of the language, the regulation adopted under the Social Security Act, now 20 CFR 404.1057. It was originally numbered differently, but at the time, in 1974, that regulation which was explicitly the source of the language the Department of Labor used, said not once, not twice, but three times, that the individual had to be employed by the household.
argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52197 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr.   Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway. So why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?
argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke # 06-593 # 52198 # TRUE # MR. BECKER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, setting aside, of course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3 which we've already explained, we would not say that that there is any credible evidence in the legislative history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was a factor. And let me explain why. The Department for the first time when it promulgated its advisory memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third party regulation. It said nothing of the sort in 1975. As support for the assertion it cited four isolated comments in the legislative history. None of them except the last   and there is only one of t-h-e-m related in any way to the exemption. The one that related to the exemption in fact directly supports our position, because it describes those people who are not within the exemption as the professional domestics. So we don't think that there's any basis for suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and, in fact, it is really implausible. Because at the same time, for example, Congress extended the provisions of the Act which covered nursing homes. At the same time, as has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual babysitters. Now We would submit that if Congress was concerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and companionship exemption, the primary intended beneficiaries of that would have been working families where both people worked and therefore who require a full-time baby sitter

Respondent in response to Justice Scalia's question about how Respondent would reconcile the regulation 552.3 and 109(a) actually did not I believe attempt any reconciliation. If I understand respondent's position correctly, it's simply 109(a) has to be invalidated dated and 552.3 stands in its entirety. I think that's incorrect for several reasons. First of all, the basis for it is essentially this apparent distinction between the define and delimit authority and the more general authority to enact necessary rules and regulation. But, in fact, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants of authority were invoked by the Department when it enacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to either subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that Justice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to attribute to the Department to say that it would exercise two different legislative powers in different parts of the   of the regulations. There's no reason it would do that. The subpart B regulations clearly are regulations that delimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15). There's no question about that. So why in fact if it was doing what Congress authorized it to do under 213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of authority in that provision, rely on some other general grant of authority? It makes no logical sense to attribute that to the Department. And it seems to me, in   excuse me   in fact, that that argument points up one of the difficulties here. It seems to me that the arguments here are a way of simply trying to push the Department aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job of exposition on this exemption. Not only contrary to the basic principle of Chevron, which is where that where is ambiguity in the statute, or room for interpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity to do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary to the statute. It is clear as I said at the beginning of my argument, the Department was the agency chosen by Congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the exception. Now I'd like to say just one other thing in response to Justice Stevens' question about the particular nature of the litigation. This is a suit for damages. It is a suit claiming will damages. Thank you, Your Honor.

COCHRAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the system described in Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the guidelines. That, of course, was a passage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham versus California. Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it meant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are merely advisory provisions. The Government's assertion that the guidelines deserve a presumption of reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the Booker decision. The ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the Booker decision before the Department of Justice issued a memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary cases. The district court below in this case did not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a 33-month within guideline sentence. The district court did not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact that he had been a combat soldier in two wars.

But the district court's sentence is going to go on appeal. And the appellate court in reviewing it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the appellate   the appellate court says oh, no, this person had   we find as a matter of fact, given the record, military service, you know, which we think should have been taken into account. And, therefore, we set it aside. Now, the next case that comes up, which doesn't have the element of military service, in all other respects the same as your client's case, it comes up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here and therefore we affirm the sentence. Isn't   in other words isn't the finding of a fact necessary for the process of judicial review, even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the district court's determination?

DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Let me try to address that and try to address Justice Alito's point about the question of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth Amendment problem arises. As I understand this Court's sequence of opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the Court has announced and must be found by a jury.
argument in case 06-5754, Rita versus United States # 06-5754 # 51967 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Or some fact, not necessarily a particular fact.
argument in case 06-5754, Rita versus United States # 06-5754 # 51968 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Any fact at all, as a matter of fact is what the Court has said, although I understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense and the offender, not facts about the world such as the prevalence of crime. Now, what that leads me to conclude is that in order to escape the bright line rule that's been announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be able to look at the set of facts that the jury found, determine what level of punishment would be advised by, say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose that level of punishment if the judge feels that a different level of punishment is appropriate. If that is a correct understanding of what this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and not an arbitrary one. Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission said, that would be very good from the Government's perspective. But as I understand the complementary rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be treated as advice rather than mandate. So while the guidelines have determined that military service is not ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.

But then he says, I recognize that in this circuit there is a strong interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has adopted a rule where they will presume a within guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in those cases. And I think with respect to the court of appeals, I think I would be wise to impose the guidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own judgment is that it should be slightly lower. What should the court of appeals do with such a sentence?

Now if a judge decides I might as a personal matter if I were writing the guidelines write them differently, and I might give great weight to military service, but one of the things that I'm required to do under section 3553(a) is to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and have similar records. And therefore, I am going to moderate my own personal preference and not impose a significant outside the range sentence, in order to ensure that I fully have taken into account the fact that we are in a Federal system with 674 Federal district judges, and we cannot have all our own personal guidelines systems. Now if a judge does that, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think that judge has actually complied with

And so even though that one judge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?
argument in case 06-5754, Rita versus United States # 06-5754 # 51978 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, I think there's a difference between a sentence that varies from what other judges would do and a sentence that is unreasonable. If the sentence that is different from what other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and coherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of disparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like this one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says in my view military service means that this defendant gets probation. Or to take an example that's on the other side, suppose that the judge says this defendant actually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal history for his prior crime, but he has been convicted before of lying to the Government about his gun charges. I'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or near it and give him eight years. I think in those circumstances a court of appeals can and should say, hold on, this is a view that the district judge is entitled to take on the merits. He's entitled to give greater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating or mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to this extent, or we're going to be left with a system in which disuniformity is the main principle.

All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33 percent of the defendants in the typical case have been in the Army. And therefore, we think that just ordinary armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed   services in the military is not a reason for a diminished sentence. That's all, period. Or they can say it the other way, the absence of a military service is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any way you want. And by the way, district judge, if you disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because we think it's unreasonable. Okay. What about that?

And then all of a sudden he says, I see you have military service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction. I mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard to be a little bit consistent? And if that's the only type of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure some degree of consistency in how similar individuals are treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises any concern.

I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates a district court sentence, that there is no presumption that binds the district judge. But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran made in his presentation was the district judge has to give reasons. He   this was just a summary paragraph at the end of the sentence hearing. He has to respond to what defendant presented. He has to respond to what the Government presented. There is an obligation stemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that the court of appeals has used. Reasons weren't given for it.
argument in case 06-5754, Rita versus United States # 06-5754 # 51999 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, I don't think there was anything problematic with what this district judge did. As Your Honor noted, this was a sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward departure. The judge at least four times in this transcript brought up Section 3553, recognizing that the judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the purposes of sentencing and the factors that were presented to him. Now he did that and he made comments along the way that indicate why he did not find physical condition, military service, or asserted vulnerability in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this defendant a lower sentence. And in his ultimate explanation, though it is brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors explicitly. He pointed to the seriousness of the offense and he pointed to the need for public protection. Now if you look at the legal obligations that the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of three different levels of explanation. First, in any case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence. Second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24 months, the judge is supposed to explain the particular reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end of the range. And finally, if the sentence is outside the range, the judge is to give the specific reason for a sentence outside the range. That statutory framework makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge imposes a guideline sentence and explains, I see no reason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met his burden of explanation without having to respond literally and in sequence to each argument that the defendant has made.

That in and of itself shows why there cannot be a presumption of reasonableness on appeal. Because you are holding the presumption to a different standard at that point. It is not a reasonableness across the board. You are putting the burden on one the parties, most likely the defendant, to come forward and explain why the presumption should be rebutted. That flies in the face with the across the board reasonableness this Court set forth in Booker. The guidelines are fraught with disparity. That why is they are advisory. That's why they can only be advisory. And the district courts must be allowed to look at them, to see them, to consider them, but ultimately to impose a sentence outside them for valid reasons. In Mr. Rita's case, the court didn't. The court felt the guidelines held some undue weight. It is indicated in the record in two places, first and foremost on page 49 of the joint appendix, where the court at the beginning of the sentencing hearing states: Other than the motion for downward departure that you submitted, do you have any other objections; and what I'm trying to do now is determine where your client fits within the sentencing guidelines.

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51698 # FALSE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court's 15-month sentence combined with 3 years of supervised release conditioned on drug treatments and the acquisition of a GED was a reasonable sentence. In the uniform and constant tradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district judge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an individual. She considered the guidelines and after doing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in every case. She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted disparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that deterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances to resume his responsibilities to himself, to his family, and to his community. The court of appeals, in contrast to the district court's careful attention to the 3553(a) factors, focused solely on the guidelines. The court of appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule. That rule re-tethers sentencing to the guideline.

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51702 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that the statute speaks of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of uniformity. And there is necessarily a tension between the individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and concerns about nationwide uniformity. But I think that what distinguishes sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the Presentencing Reform Act system are several. One is now we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors the judge must consider. 3553 didn't exist before that time. Secondly, in every case, as a practical matter, the guidelines are going to exert a gravitational weight because they are there. They must be considered as part of the statute.

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51707 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, I guess the question is how strong should we say or can we say, or can Congress say it is?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51708 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that the strength should be no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I think the danger, particularly after 20 years of guideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of exercising their discretion, which now runs to the full limit of 3553(a).
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51709 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Then it seems to me that to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from the process.

The cases that the Booker Court cited to illustrate the standard of review of reasonableness were all highly deferential decisions regarding revocations following supervised release, affirming sentences that were many times what the chapter 7 policy guidelines would require.

DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Even under a mandatory guidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it recognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an important goal of individualized sentencing. And the Court in Koon recognized that district courts in their institutional position have a special competence to determine what's ordinary in a case, what's unusual in a case. The court of appeals lacks that special competence. It sees only a tiny fraction of the number of guideline cases. It doesn't have

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51720 # TRUE # MR.

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51721 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It's impossible to do in the abstract. If you're just looking at a particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is reasonable or not. There has to be a background to it so that you know that in this type of case, people usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a sentence of 10 years. And it seems to me that what's ordinary is going to be a judge   a driving fact in determining what's reasonable.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51722 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think the court of appeals' job is to ensure that the district judge provides reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of that case that establish that the district court had complied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case, selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater than necessary. I don't believe that it is the court of appeals' job, as was remarked earlier, to become a sentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh district courts' decisions.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51723 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Even if you're looking at not just the number, but the reasons. In other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got nine district judges, they all say we do not depart downward for military service, and you've got one district judge that says we do. It seems to me that if the court of appeals can't review that to bring about some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51724 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think it is not lawless in the sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether in a particular case, the differences it finds are warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case, whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines, has looked at the history and characteristics of that defendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of the crime. And if those reasons satisfy the court that a reasonable judge looking at those facts  
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51725 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # On my particular case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals? They've got two cases before them. One, the judge departs three years because of military service. The prosecutor appeals. The other, the judge refuses to depart because of military service and the defendant appeals. Should those   what should happen with those two cases?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51726 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think the same process of review applies to each. And it may result   and that process of review is on the record in that case, would a reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence? And that review may result in both cases being reversed, one, or the other, or neither being reversed.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51727 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Where does that come from as a matter of law? That is, suppose   now you can say I   if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I start with an assumption that Congress did want the court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals create a degree of uniformity. Suppose I start with that assumption and say that's what the guidelines were about and the reason that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among many. After all, it was attached to a bill that was the guideline bill. And indeed, the part we excised was a floor amendment that came along later to make it even tougher. So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is there something in the Constitution that forbids it? That's where I start   I am starting personally with that question in mind, always, if this is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless there's something in the Constitution that forbids it. And is there something in the Constitution that would forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it? Now, just going through the different elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that what the district judge did was unreasonable?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51728 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think there is a constitutional problem with that. And it is that if   it reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system. And I think if there is to be an effectively advisory system, sentencing cannot center on the guidelines. The district judge needs to be free to accept or reject that advice and 3553(a), instead of the guidelines, becomes the focal point for sentencing.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51729 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It's not mandatory. It says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now, let's think here. We have 8   7 people on the sentencing commission that have really looked into that. And they think that in an ordinary course with this small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many months. That reflects a lot of thought. Seems reasonable to us. And here the district judge is giving him half that or 40 percent of that without a good reason that we can find. The judge said he did it because it was just one little episode and we think there were many episodes. And that's basically their reason. Now, now   what   the Sixth Amendment forbids that?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51730 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Of course, the court of appeals did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case. In

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51732 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The Eighth Circuit in this case simply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an extraordinary variance and we are reversing. The district court has to consider the sentencing guidelines and generally that must be part of the reason   elaboration of judgment, so they will necessarily be considered on appeal. But the notion somehow that simply because a sentence is in the guidelines, all disparity problems have been resolved, is clearly not true. As the amici briefs, and our brief have pointed out, even under a mandatory guidelines system, racial disparity increased, regional disparity increased. It's disparity that individualized sentencing, the judicial discretion necessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing, can counteract. And that is genuine uniformity. As   as you pointed out in the Koon decision, or the Koon pointed out borrowing your language from Rivera, the district court's special competence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is exactly the kind of information the sentencing commission needs to determine whether a guideline works or doesn't work.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51733 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Aren't you really saying that the most weight that the guidelines can be given, or guidelines can be   is that   I apologize for my voice   the most weight the guidelines can be given is, is the weight of necessary advertence? The guidelines, in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). The rest of them say individualized sentencing. The guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the guidelines. Therefore, in order to   to break this, in effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I think the most that you can concede is that before a district judge sentences finally, he must show that he has considered the value of uniformity as something different from individualized sentencing, but that's as much as he can be required to do. Is that a fair statement of your position?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51734 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yeah. And I think 3553(a), in fact   I expect Mr. Dreeben to say this   talks about uniformity, twice, in the sense that both 3553(a)(4), which requires consideration of the guidelines, and 3553(a)(6) talks about unwarranted  
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51735 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes. I   I stand corrected here. I'm sorry.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51736 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But I agree with you that it is a consideration   and I'm not talking about a check list. I'm not saying that we just use a list and that's enough. There has to   I think sentencing under an advisory system requires reason and judgment. We tried to stress in our brief that judgment is somehow different. It may involve fact-finding but is not the determinant, the automatic jury kind of finding that the guidelines require.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51737 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, as one of the themes that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time. I assume they would be adjusted to be more precise, but then we are right back where we started because you want to give the guidelines very little effect. It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing against yourself. If your view is accepted and the result is considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can do is have mandatory minimums.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51738 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't believe that, that the results are going to be considerable disparity. Certainly no more disparity than existed under the mandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed particularly. I think indeed there may be more non-guideline sentences, but less true disparity, because it really is kind of idle to talk about disparity unless you are measuring it against something. And 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity is measured  
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51739 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted? You remember those days.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51740 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I do remember those days. And I think there are two significant points about that. One, judges sentenced in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act, knowing that their sentence wasn't the real time served. So that a judge may say 20 year sentence knowing the defendant was immediately eligible for parole and was going to get out soon. The real number was parole eligibility sentencing. So that looking at just the actual sentence imposed did not tell you very much about disparity. And none   in the study that the sentencing commission in its amicus cited   that study explicitly said that none of the studies looking at pre-Sentencing Reform Act interjudge disparity considered actual sentences served as opposed to actual sentences imposed.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51741 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yeah, yeah. But there   you know, we can go back into that, but there was a whole history that people testified, tremendously, no opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge wheel. Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of the judge? And why did you get different sentences across the country which I don't   I've never heard a possibility of explaining that the judges didn't understand what the parole commission was like. That's a different issue. So what   what I'm concerned about is if we followed your position literally, what we're saying is that the Constitution of the United States prevents any effort to create uniform sentences throughout the country for people who different judges   God doesn't tell us what the right sentence is. We don't know. There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range of possible sentences. And you're saying we have to go back to that. And that wasn't   I'm looking, in other words, for you to tell me something that says we don't have to be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid either. And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest with you, and I haven't   I'm not certain I get it.

That is, one as in this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence him to more than 15 months would throw away his life. Another might say it's   it's unreal to assume that he just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had been out on that same street every night for two and a half weeks. So the quantity is much larger. And he was in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less. Those could be reasonable determinations, two different reactions that judges would have to the same set of facts.

It's very easy. It was what the dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is use facts found by the jury and you can have the sentences as rigid as you like. It is really only, only when you want to let the facts be found by the judge that you come into the difficulty that, that we're arguing about. But it's certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there is no way to achieve determinate sentencing. There certainly is.

But one of, one of the arguments that was made by defense counsel here was just there was   there is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack and the penalty for powdered cocaine. Your predecessor thought that was so wrong, he thought it was unconstitutional. I think at the very least you ought to take into account that if this man were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the guideline sentence range would have been six months to a year. Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that disparity. Is a district judge free to say under advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though he possessed powdered cocaine?

And the application had some numbers to it, so she said it was more serious because it was a crack cocaine case, you're going to get more than somebody who was involved with powder would get, but you don't need to get as much as the guidelines call for, for the reasons that she expressed on the record at the sentencing.

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51773 # FALSE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Booker concluded that the remedial severing of the statute's provision for mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the statute constitutional. It further implied a standard of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on appeal, and it did not elaborate what that reasonableness requirement means. The Government submits that the best interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's original intent of minimizing and eliminating unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly situated defendants.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51774 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # As closely as it can, and the "as it can" depends upon violation of the Sixth Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury. Suppose in this case the court of appeals instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it? And then in the next case that comes up involving what was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of cocaine powder rather than crack, okay? Suppose in the next case it would have been 30 grams of powder. And the district court judge once again departs just the way the departure was here, and the court of appeals says no, that departure is unreasonable. You now have circuit law which says 30 grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams, you're entitled to a lesser sentence. Okay? Why isn't   why haven't we fallen back into the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan? You have fact findings being made by the judge. It's a judge who decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams. What difference does it make whether that factual difference produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a series of opinion by a court of appeals? Isn't the Sixth Amendment equally violated?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51775 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Scalia, as I think we talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals does is essentially function as a sentencing commission, literally prescribing particular levels of punishment for recurring sets of facts. The Government's submission here is not that the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a proportionality principle. A proportionality principle will look to all of the facts of the case and will try to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in response to all of the facts and circumstances that the judge articulated within  
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51776 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But if you have two cases that are in other respects similar, and the court of appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51777 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, he doesn't, Justice Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same level of leniency or any leniency at all. That judge will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at the totality of the facts and conclude whether a sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable sentence. And unlike a situation that some of us might prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the system of reasonableness review on top of advisory guidelines will not produce perfect levels of consistency. And what the defendant is entitled to under the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing that if the law says if I commit this crime and these are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial entitlement. That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles you. But no defendant who commits a crack offense can say that even after a series of court of appeals rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness. That defendant will not know whether the judge that he or she appears in front of will give the same kind of weight to those facts as some other judge did who was affirmed or reversed. Nor will that judge be able to say what is the constellation of policy and factual reasons that this particular judge will find in announcing the judge's sentence. So I don't think that a proportionality principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. And I don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or any other part of the statute. What the Court is left with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I submit it should ask the same question that it asked in Booker itself: Which alternative, the Petitioner's alternative in this case or the Government's, conforms more closely to Congress's original claim in the Sentencing Reform Act? The Petitioner's version of appellate review as I understand it is very light review, if at all, of the substance of what the district judge does. It may reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a second degree murderer, I think probation is the appropriate sentence. Perhaps the Petitioner would concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away, Petitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine whether a particular sentence is reasonable. And that is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when eight of them have adopted this proportionality principle.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51778 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # May I ask this question: It seems to me that in sentencing there are two different broad categories of decision that the judge has to make, one involving the severity of the crime, and the other the characteristics of the particular offender. And might it not be the case that you give a greater presumption of following the guidelines when you're talking about the severity of the offense, and a greater deference to the trial judge when you're evaluating the factors of the individual that might affect the sentence? There might be a difference in the  
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51779 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think at a high level of generality, that is true. Because what the sentencing commission is good at is taking paradigmatic circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that will transfer into a sentence. And what the strength of the district judge is is looking at the defendant in front of that particular judge and seeing how that person's characteristics may map onto the policies of sentencing. But I don't agree that that distinction would support a two-track form of appellate review that would give the district judge greater deference to take personal characteristics into account and to impose widely varying sentences. That is exactly the situation that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when any district judge could choose whatever policies of sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and impose a widely disparate sentence. And as the Court well knows, there was no appellate review of that exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the judge didn't exercise discretion at all. Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same sentence. That would not take into account the full range of facts and factors that are present in the sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an exercise of discretion. But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era, the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what facts mattered. If we continue with that same sort of deference on appeal in the Booker remedial opinion, then it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some consistency and uniformity in the way district judges impose sentencing.

You'd say look, one thing a district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe the guideline is right for a typical case. And I think this is a typical case. And I won't follow the guideline. You couldn't think those three things?

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51782 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So one big power a judge has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to say the guideline itself is unreasonable. So we're   let's just say   and there if they say that, the district judge could decide whether or not, the court of appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not reasonable. But leave those cases aside. I imagine they'll be few and far between. Now we take one they assume is reasonable. And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three things. One, to give the kind of thing that   the reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits is reasonable for a typical case. So what's the kind of thing that leads you to think yours is not typical? And he says it. And then he has the evidence as to the related facts. And then he has the degree of departure. As to the first thing, the court of appeals could review it and decide whether it is or is not the kind of thing. As to the second and third, they also could review it but only after giving considerable weight to what the district judge thinks about the case in front of him. Now maybe that's   I mean, you might not have a reaction to that. I'd have to sort of think about it.

DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT #   then it runs into the same problem that led to the constitutional problem in Booker. Where I think I would amend Your Honor's proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe what I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the reasons why, in the pre-Sentencing   in the pre-Booker system, that could have been problematic legally. Today, it is not forbidden. But what it should be subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal that take a look at what are the reasons that the district judge articulated for that sentence.

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51789 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I do think, though, that the Court should be concerned about each district judge formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing guidelines and then applying them in the court to the cases that appear on that judge's docket without any check on appellate review to ensure that, although the sentence might be in some possible world reasonable, it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission has prescribed and what other district judges are doing. If there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the Sentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a reasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial opinion thought it was accomplishing. What the Booker remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was providing an important mechanism that Congress itself had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron out sentencing differences. And our submission is that inherently means some form of substantive proportionality review.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51790 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # That's the other thing I'm not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means. That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something, but proportional to what? I mean, I can think of two problems. One problem, of course, is that the chart in the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to 10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to 30, it's 2 years. Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just have nothing to do with your reason for departure. You might have added on something for having a gun and your reason for being lenient might have to do with the person's having a gun. So you're going to say it make a difference whether you were high up or whether you were low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to do with whether you're high up or whether you were low down? You see? It doesn't actually work, I don't think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to say what's proportional.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51791 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think what is proportional is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that have been using this rule have not had a great deal of difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and have a sense of is this a significant deviation away from what the guidelines would actually describe.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51792 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, why use the word "proportional," because the other thing is what the Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot?

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51794 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Mr. Dreeben, if we could focus on the facts of this case and what the district court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality judgment, too. She said this is a young man. It's his first offense. He has a good family relationship, a good work record. I am making a determination that will put him away for a significant amount of time. But I'm trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away. That was the judgment that she made. She tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15 months, but that would not be so long that it would put him out of touch with his children and his wife and his work. Now, in   by some measures that would be entirely reasonable. But on your measure, it isn't reasonable.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51795 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's right. And I think, Justice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of articulating a justification for the sentence than the judge's own articulation, which did not focus on family separation and employment to the degree that you have now articulated it. What the judge did was focus on the quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't have any criminal history and that he qualified for the safety valve. She also said, without specifying any other cases, that other cases that have come before my court have had   you know   perhaps larger quantity of drugs and very different sentences. When a court of appeals is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is reasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we know anything, for example, about what this judge is saying about other cases with other drug quantities? There's no specifics in the record that enable the Court of Appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of that observation. It's also relevant for the court of appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken into account all of the factors that this judge has previously noted and what has happened in the sentence is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence for reasons that the commission already took into account. Now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from relying on those facts, but it does mean that the farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.

What she ignored is his own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a street corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine, that he was arrested and placed into the State system, put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug court, in essence being said, here's your chance, you know, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you, we're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate with your family, and what did the defendant do but get caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack.

He had been previously arrested for crack distribution crimes. He had admitted that this was not   the occasion of his arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal crack. He'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months. And the judge essentially turned all of those facts off. She did not really factor that into her sentence at all. And the court of appeals, although it may have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had treated him as, the record does indeed support the court of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant, despite his criminal history, really looks more like a recidivist. And when you're talking about a defendant whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5 years, but who gets out of that sentence because he satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is a first-time offender and meets certain other requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been substantially reduced under the guidelines because of the safety valve and because of his criminal history. And the judge basically said: I'm going to take a chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than what the guidelines described. Our view is the judge can look at the facts she looked at, but she went down to a level that is productive of unwarranted disparity.

His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm going to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, I'm going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she said a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence. I submit that in that circumstances the Petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this deviation is unreasonable. And I have no problem with a Petitioner making that argument if that's what happens to his or her client. My problem is that without that kind of anchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality review, a court of appeals has almost nothing to work with.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51816 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But what happens when that case   it goes back down to the district court. The district court says well, okay, not 10 years. Nine years. Okay? It goes back up. I mean, you know, when do we end this game? Or does the court of appeals take over the sentencing function and specify   you know, five years?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51817 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Scalia, I don't think that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a sentence. There have been a couple of instances where courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on this particular constellation of facts. I think that reflect as sense of potential impatience with a ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge, and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day lower. Another solution to that problem would be reassignment to a different judge who would start with a clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion and apply the section 3553 factors. We are not suggesting that the court of appeals should assume the sentencing role here. All we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to identify and select unreasonable sentences versus reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark, it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their tasks. And if the courts of appeals can do that, can look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the farther that it goes outside the guidelines range, without violating the statute and without violating the Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the Court to ask at that point is which approach, that approach of proportionality, or and approach that basically says appellate review is procedural only, absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of uniformity and consistency.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51818 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, it wouldn't be, just be procedural only. You   you could say procedural plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on which the district court was   was proceeding. So you, if you could find that the determination that this was just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51819 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That   that is true. But I submit that   I would like to hear what Petitioner has to say. If Petitioner's client had been given 10 years in this case, I have no doubt that Petitioner would be arguing that's an unreasonable sentence. But I don't see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court has articulated a rationale that's consistent with section 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts, unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the analysis. Thank you.

argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51822 # FALSE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I believe that Justice Breyer put his finger on one of the central problems with the Government's proposed rule. And that is what does it mean? The Government talks about substantial variances in Petitioner's case. The court of appeals spoke of it as extraordinary variances. And the Government doesn't suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or means something different from extraordinary. And we've already demonstrated in our brief why relying on percentages as the court of appeals also did, is pointless, because, one, if   the arithmetic gets very complicated at the low end and the percentages just don't make any sense from a proper application of a rule of law. The Government's proposal, apart from having no basis in the statute and no basis in Booker, is just not susceptible of any kind of application because nobody really knows what it means.
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51823 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What about Mr. Dreeben's parting challenge? What are you going to do if your client gets 10 years? You're going to argue that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines, right?
argument in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States # 06-5618 # 51824 # TRUE # MR. DWYER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm certainly going to argue that under the facts and the record before the Court, that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not greater than necessary. And I think the absence of a prior record, the young man's work history, all of those factors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his age, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision, could not possibly support a 10-year sentence. And you know, it is easy to do this in a, in a hypothetical sort of way. But the district judge   and this was a very experienced district judge   looking at the person in the eye, made a call based on judgment. And that call was not treated with any respect in the court of appeals. It was sloganeered away as an extraordinary variance. And   because the court of appeals focused only on the guidelines. The   this Court in crafting the appellate standard can't just look to determine what Congress might have intended because of the constitutional problem that lurks behind it. And that constitutional problem is a resumption of mandatory guidelines. Thank you very much.

argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51433 # FALSE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner is before this Court because he followed an order of the district court. He filed his notice of appeal within the time authorized by the district court. It was only when the matter came before the court of appeals was it raised that the district court apparently had no authority to grant a 17-day extension, although it specified a specific date rather than the 14 days in connection with the case.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51434 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes, it was authorized by the district court in the sense the district court put it on a piece of paper. It wasn't authorized because the district court had no authority to extend that.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51435 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The district court put it on there. When you look at the actual entry itself, it's a handwritten entry. There's no way of telling from the handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on the docket on the same date because all you have is the handwritten entry, February 10, file your appeal by February 27, which is unusual in a civil case because normally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't get a directive from the Court that you have 30 days to file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with this. So I don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a directive from a court.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51436 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But you knew that 14 days was the maximum because the motion asking for it cited and quoted from the rule.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51437 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that   we did cite from the rule. That is correct. When the order came out   well, first of all, we were glad to get the order to allow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just looking at the date, something had to be done. And Of course, we filed on one day before the end date  
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51438 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What if, what if the District Court gave you an extra month? Would your argument still be the same, that that   because the court set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51439 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, then you get into certain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the circumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant rely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the court gave to it. But here certainly this order is not unreasonable. It's certainly within the confines. And you have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal by this date.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51440 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But wouldn't a reasonable lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I made this motion for extension of time. The rule said 14 days; this judge obviously made a slip. He miscalculated. Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order, say the judge probably made a mistake? So I better, if I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51441 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, looking back, that is probably correct. But looking at the order, and the way it came out, and the fact that you know, the   the rule allowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at the end date of the order, make sure the notice of appeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that the party who is adversely affected by it may object on that basis, saying Judge, you have no authority to do this, what are you doing in connection with  
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51442 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Why isn't   this is just a notice of appeal. Why would you   why not file it the same day? In terms of looking at it from some equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the difference between the 14 days and the days allowed. What   why, why would you delay filing the notice of appeal?
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51443 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the only reason for delaying it is obviously workload. And you don't want to get all briefs due within a short period of time, once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular case, because you have time limits for getting the record, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of appeals going out   not in this Court, but you know there were a number of appeals going on. And my normal practice is you know, file your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable appeals time.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51444 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Does it make   does it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve provision? In other words, you've got the 30 days to file; and then this rule allows you to   it's a safety valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14 days. And now it seems to me that you're asking for a safety valve on top of a safety valve. And I wonder if there's some point where you cut off the   allowing an out for missing the deadline.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51445 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I suppose at some point, someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be unreasonable in connection with that. I think the safer thing is just to put the order down, say application, reopen the appeal time, granted. And then it would cause someone to go you know, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is allotted under the rule in connection with the case. But I don't think it's unreasonable; in these circumstances we're only talking about three days to do an act. The act was done in two days.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51446 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, but as soon as you start talking about an exception from the provision in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of applications and there are going to be a lot of different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last day. Once that   it seems to me, you open it up for an indeterminate ruling.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51447 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, this is an equitable rule in itself. Because it allows something where an appeal time has expired, can you come in and show the circumstances, one, you were not notified, which obviously the court did. The other side's prejudiced  
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51448 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well it is an equitable rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51449 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that's   that's once it's granted. It's not, the time limit is 180 days or the seven day after you received or became aware actual notice  
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51450 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No, but Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical. In other words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to provide a safety valve. But they also appreciated that you can't have it open-ended. So they did impose limits on the   if you want to call it equitable exception to the 30-day rule. And it seems to me that you sort of restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if you allow further equitable departures from their, their rule.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51451 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think in past cases the Court has always recognized there are deadlines but there are exceptions to deadlines. And the most compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at this particular time. And you know, it's coming from a judicial officer, it's not coming from someone miscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time when it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10 days run in connection with the case. Because in civil litigation you are not given any specific time to do an act. Criminal cases are a little bit different. You are told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed in connection with a case. You do not have in civil, when you get your final order   you know you have 30 days to do it.

And then when the ruling is made, the appeal is filed within the appropriate time. And this Court has sanctioned that procedure in connection. I see no difference here, where a litigant before a court, the court issues an order, you look at the order. And you abide by the order in connection with the case.

Because you look back at the history of this case, when the court dismissed the original petition, the court had a date on it.

We're relying to the exceptions, and there's a number exceptions on deadlines that have come out. We have the equitable tolling, we have the waiver, forfeiture issue. And, you know, in this case, specific assurance by a court which in a past opinion seemed to control the date, where a judge gave you a specific assurance that you could do something in connection with the case. The old Harris Truck case is where the lawyer was on vacation. The judge said well, I'll give you some extra time. Even though they knew of the judgment, they knew the time would run, he said I'll give you extra time to file the appeal because you want to contact the lawyer who was on vacation. The court of appeals then said well, the rule didn't apply because you knew of the order, so   but that was overlooked even though by time calculation, everybody was out of time. The Eberhart case, they were out of time because the motion for new trial was filed untimely, which under the rule required a timely filing of a motion for a new trial in order to toll your appeal time. So this, obviously the motion to reopen was timely filed, was filed within the 180 days required by the rule. The other side was served. The other side had no objection to it and didn't oppose it. The real issue when you look at an equitable   sort of an equitable rule like this, is the other side prejudiced, and obviously they are not prejudiced.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51520 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # One of the things I think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that there would be a point at which the prevailing party in the district court could know with certainty there wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that. It's not open-ended. Under your rule where the actual time for filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never really quite have that assurance, would they?

MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, if you go back to the rules, you're going into the six months, 180 days, and then, you know, you would say something. Or if the court, you know, gave you a year or something by mistake, you know, it would   you know, that something does not sound right here. And then you would look at it. At least if that were the case, you could probably go in and get the court to reconsider, bring it to the attention of the court. Your Honor, we did not have all of this time. Did you make a mistake? You can always correct mistakes. But that was not done here, it was not done by the respondent in this case because they didn't   the respondent did not object to the application to reopen the appeal, did not say anything  
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51524 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But the respondent said he had no reason at that time to believe that you wouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days. So if they made an objection, the moment the judge put down a date that's 17 days later, the judge might say that's premature.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51525 # TRUE # MR. MANCINO # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well then, the judge may have said well, I don't   look at the rule. I don't have it. I'm going to redraft the order, vacate my order and put a proper order on in connection with the case. It would seem to me that at some point in the appellate process, because when you look at the history that the Sixth Circuit in this case   at least when the court then granted a certificate of appealability, you would think the respondent would   what are   why are you granting a certificate of appealability when you told us we have no jurisdiction over this case, or at least from the two orders anyway, they said they had jurisdiction over the February 10th order that   on the appeal. And the   then the certificate of appealability was denied, and normally that would end the case.

argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51542 # FALSE # MR. MARSHALL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner's failure to meet the 14-day statutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is fatal to his case for three reasons. First, the 14-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and Federal district courts do not have the power to enlarge this time period. Second, the 14-day rule was not forfeited by the state of Ohio and may be raised by the court sua sponte in any event. Third, even if there could be some sort of limited equitable exception to the 14-day time requirement, the petitioner here falls far short of demonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary relief. Let me explain why. The petitioner's claim that notice of appeal time requirements are not jurisdictional contradicts 150 years of practice, countless lower court decisions, settled congressional understanding as to the meaning of its governing

argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51544 # TRUE # MR. MARSHALL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I think it is its own form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way that final judgments on appeals are subject matter jurisdiction. And the reason why is that notice of appeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense, in that they transfer the locus of the case from one court to another. In the appellate system, there's actually a changing of the jurisdiction, and the notice of appeal is that triggering mechanism. And in that sense, it is classically jurisdictional and different from the other kinds of time limits that this Court addressed in Kontrick, in versus Eberhart because those took place within a particular court system, the district court system, where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction triggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the other.

The second reason, Your Honor, by the way, is congressional, is the congressional reenactment of the notice of appeal time deadlines, which also indicates that Congress treats these

argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51548 # TRUE # MR. MARSHALL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor, but when there is a background, as there is in this case, of 150 years of practice where Congress has enacted against that background, it is presumed to be jurisdictional. And I'd also point out that with respect to this Court's jurisdiction, the Court has treated petitions for certiorari as jurisdictional in civil cases because there is a statutory underpinning, but has not treated them as jurisdictional in criminal cases in part because there is not a statutory underpinning.

MARSHALL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I think the latter recognizes the fact that it doesn't necessarily have to be. That is correct. However, that Congress and this Court can treat such a thing because it is in a   because it is a   because it does transfer the case from one to another. I think that the criminal   that in the certiorari case, with respect to criminal, it might be an indication there that there might be some relation. But I would also suggest that with respect to certiorari practice, you've already   you're already in the appellate mode and you're not dividing the jurisdiction between trial courts and appellate courts. But the quick answer is yes, Your Honor, I don't think it has to be jurisdictional, but certainly it can be jurisdictional. And for 150 years, this Court and Congress has treated this particular division as jurisdictional.

But this Court in Barnhart suggested that in determining whether something is jurisdictional or not, one looks at the context of the particular location. Here this Rule 21   excuse me.

But that statute has been enacted against, as I keep reemphasizing, 150 years of practice, including the Edmondson case in 1869, where the Court on its own motion raised the matter as being jurisdictional and because the time period had not been complied with dismissed the appeal. The question essentially isn't whether we're going to call it jurisdictional or not. The question is the effect of the particular rule. Some of the lower courts call its indications of jurisdiction or a prerequisite to jurisdiction. The question is what the treatment of this particular requirement is and the treatment of this particular requirement consistently for over 150 years has been that it is mandatory, jurisdictional, non-forfeitable, it can be raised by the court sua sponte.

There is no equitable exception to it as well if it's jurisdictional. So all of those three attach to the term "jurisdictional."

So that, for example, in a diversity case, if two years or three years after it proceeds to final judgment somebody realizes that both parties were from the same State, the collateral attack would normally not allow to change that, to change that result. And I would think that the same thing would happen here. If the case had proceeded to final judgment, if there were an error of this type, as with other types of errors in subject matter jurisdiction, there would not be an opening for collateral attack.

If I understand your question, with respect to the unique circumstances doctrine, this doesn't fit in because in the unique circumstances doctrine the litigant actually has to seek a particular type of relief and get granted that relief. The Petitioner here did not seek leave to file his motion of appeal within 17 days. The Petitioner here sought, which is the only thing he could do under the rules, is seek to reopen for 14 days.

Buy in Thompson what occurred was the Petitioner requested a new trial untimely, but was told by the court that they had timely requested a new trial.

For four basic reasons the deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable. First, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107 directly implicates the concerns that underlie the special treatment of jurisdictional issues. It's a fundamental precept of our legal system that Federal courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating cases where Congress has not authorized them to do so. Or to put it another way, our legal system has presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the misapplication of law in cases that a court is authorized to adjudicate.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51642 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Stewart, do you think this is subject   that question is subject matter jurisdiction?
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51643 # TRUE # MR. STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We would   we would characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction. That is, this Court has often said that it's the fundamental duty of this Court when doubt is   when doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction and that of the court from which the record comes. And that division presupposes that there are cases over which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction, over which this Court would not have appellate jurisdiction. For example, situations sometimes arise, particularly in cases that are adjudicated by three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute as to whether a particular district court order is directly appealable to this Court or should go instead to the court of appeals. And if somebody comes to this Court and this Court determines that the appeal should have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction. This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51644 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Stewart, that's one those interesting examples. We lack jurisdiction of the case but we have power to order it refiled, to vacate the order and have it refiled, don't we?
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51645 # TRUE # MR. STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is an anomaly. The Court has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the case except to vacate the order.

argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51646 # TRUE # MR. STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But I think Mr. Marshall has identified the second example, namely the final decision requirement of 28 USC 1291. That is, that's universally conceded to be a jurisdictional rule, even though it has nothing to do with whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It is simply whether this particular decision over   for which review is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals. And our point

STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think the courts of appeals have not required that they be written on the record but have required that there be a basis appearing in the record for those findings. So, for instance, if Petitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to reopen in the time, but had not represented that he had not been informed of the judgment, then I think that if the court had granted the reopening, that could be set aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support in the record for such a finding. But I don't believe the courts of appeals have required there be explicit findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the grant of the reopening. The point I was going to make about the certiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1 imposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all cases. It is not divided between civil and criminal. But this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has a very different status is criminal cases than in civil cases. That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out of time, the clerk is directed not to file it. And Rule 13.2 cites USC 21.01(c). So the clear implication is that the Court recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil cases to be a jurisdictional limit. And the crucial point of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word jurisdictionally. It's that it gives an instruction to the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether any other party objects. It's the very type of thing that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction, as to matters over which it has an obligation to take cognizance, regardless of the other party's objection. In criminal cases by contrast the 90-day rule applies under the rules, but the Court has recognized that it retains the authority to grant petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where the other party objects. The other thing I would say about 2107(a) and it's   part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the Government's brief. In the last full paragraph of page 16, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in similar cases is set by 28 U.S.C 2107(a), which states that   and then the part we haven't reproduced says except as otherwise provided in this section. And then it goes on to say no appeal shall bring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30 days. And the significance of this provision, this language, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days. Language like that would conceivably leave open the question of what happens if the notice of appeal is untimely filed. This language actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within 30 days, the appeal will not bring the judgment

While here, we have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered with a   you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you have till the 27th to file.
argument in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell # 06-5306 # 51666 # TRUE # MR. STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, are two things we would say about Thompson. The first is that as this Court explained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn, it's long been recognized that a timely motion for reconsideration will suspend the finality of the judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal. And the Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that under certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for reconsideration will have that effect, if the judge appropriately considers it on the merits. And Thompson can be explained as holding simply that where the Government does not object and the district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as timely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend the finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has to read   has to be read to stand for a broader equitable principle. The other thing I'd say about Thompson is that for better or for worse, the Government's brief in opposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the cert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure. Therefore the Court in Thompson was not required to grapple with congressionally imposed limits.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51210 # FALSE # MR. HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The constitutional error that occurred in Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can result in a conviction of an innocent person. Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of that error or evaluated the effect of that error under the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard. Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple. In the California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional trial error that occurred in this case. Had that court complied with this Court's precedent, that court would have first identified the constitutional error that occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the effect of that error under the Chapman test. The failure of that court to do so, the unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings. It scarcely seems reasonable

And the fact of the matter is if he had filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that, it would have effectively been asking at that stage for a type of error correction. It scarcely seems logical that the scope of the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the constitutional violation that he suffered, that that should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable decision-making of the State appellate court in the

Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on   or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. Now, you know, why would there   what does he care whether   whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation? Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51214 # TRUE # MR. HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Scalia, that's the point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief here. And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit truncated, by the State appellate court. But it was not a Chapman analysis. And that failure of the State appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is contrary to this Court's precedent. It ignores Chapman, it also would be an attack on

Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation. Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?

HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't know that necessarily there has to be one standard of review for the other   for one or the other, Your Honor.

You cannot divorce   there is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial.

The State appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter of State law in this case. The court also concluded that there was no constitutional error. Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97 of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case. However, in making that alternative holding, the State appellate court, the California court, was applying what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent of the Kotteakos type standard.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51226 # TRUE # MR. HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, first of all, this case, since it has now been determined in the Federal courts that there was an underlying constitutional violation, does not present that question. We do   and I understand the position that you are raising, Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the logic there. I don't think the Court has to resolve that here. Some of the lower Federal courts have determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht standard has been completely supplanted. Some courts have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus is Esparza to lead to that conclusion. And that may very well be the case. However, I don't think the Court needs to ultimately address that proposition in this case.

As I understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right. And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing. There could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person. That means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals court finds no error. Now, we get over to the Federal court. And they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End of case.

The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression on me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a different context, it's the same problem. He said, I originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could conscientiously say, although I consider the findings clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes from an agency. But when I think about it, I don't think there's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that this is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll reverse. I mean, I find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing is possible.

If you'd look at the district court's treatment of this case, at the district court level the court stated: "Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating actionable error," and that court is applying the Brecht standard. The district court states: "I cannot rule out prejudice in this case." So seemingly had that court applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in the district court. Likewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice even under the Brecht standard, and then we have the panel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the prejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples' testimony been admitted that would have substantially bolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence. That statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is harmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying the Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in Mr. Fry's

And to Justice Stevens' question, as you pointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard which this court adopted in Brecht is an exacting standard. And in applying that standard, if you'd look at this case, the Court's decisions, Sullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the jury.

My answer to that is no, because Mr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman. And this Court could in this case simply decide this case on that very narrow question, like many court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply, Brecht or Chapman, when there has been no Chapman analysis in the State court or when there has been an objectively unreasonable Chapman analysis in the State court. Most courts confronted with that issue say, we don't need to decide the question here because either the error was plainly harmless under both of those standards or plainly not harmless under both of these standards. And I simply recounted the history of the litigation below in the Federal courts to point out that this could be a case where that make a difference. It seems like

That's the first question. Very generalized. Second question: Does it matter which harmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I thought it meant, you know, is there any difference between the two standards? Don't you think that's fair reading of it.

What is prejudice when you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury where nine days into the deliberations at least five of them voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty.

In such a case, we think it's conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judge's   the jury's decision?

But that's my basic question in this case and it's a serious question. Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, and if I really try I can bring myself to understand this question. Regardless of what I think, could another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have thought the opposite? I can do that mentally. You try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm sorry. I admit it. Now, if that's the state of mind that I can get myself into   and I believe that's true of many judges   how do I write words that are realistic in this area?

And I don't quarrel at all with the way that the court described   said that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless error inquiry in the O'Neal case, that it doesn't fit to look at it in terms of the allocation of burden. I don't think that this case ultimately turns on that, except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted by the district court judge did state that he was looking to Mr. Fry to make the sufficient showing

And this Court may very well deem that to be necessary. But I think also that this Court fashioning a decision which is faithful to the requirement that   or the principle that Kotteakos is an exacting standard, would also be an important constitutional principle. In a case like this, where there has been no Chapman review and where the Chapman court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error standard in order to safeguard convictions, safeguard against erroneous convictions where there is a close question of guilt or innocence, that hasn't happened in this case and it would be appropriate for this Court to fashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure that that happens.

The same concern, Justice Ginsburg, holds over in certain limited 2255 cases. If I may save the balance of my time.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51288 # FALSE # MR. MOODY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal habeas is limited in scope and purpose. It is not a continuation of the appellate process. Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State sovereignty. In Brecht, this court held that the stringent Chapman standard was inappropriate for use on collateral review. Instead, in order to strike a proper balance between State and Federal interests, the actual prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect on the verdict should be used in collateral cases. Petitioner is asking for an exception to this rule. He claims that if he did not receive Chapman review in State court, he should receive it on Federal habeas. That was not the rule in Brecht and it should not be adopted by this Court here. The Brecht decision did not state an exception based on the State standard used. The key in Brecht was that appropriate balance between the Federal Government and the State. This Court has never treated cases where there was not a state Chapman finding differently from other cases. It applies Brecht throughout. In the Penry case and in the O'Neal case there was no Chapman finding in state court, yet this Court applied Brecht and made no comment about that.

This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG in the briefs. He states them very well. The first is let's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded. Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of   an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence. So that's their finding on the merits. Then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. How could both those things be true? How could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? That's one thing they say. But the exclusion was harmless. I just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51300 # TRUE # MR. MOODY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that the explanation is as follows. When you're analyzing the denial of a defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first look to see how it fit into the defense. And that is what they were doing. You're not looking at the entire case. You're looking only at the defense. And so in the sense that something is better than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven may improve the defense case. And yet nonetheless, when you move to the next question, which is, was there a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking at everything that was available to the jury   it may be that there was still so much other evidence that it could overcome whatever increase you received on the defense.

MOODY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. I briefed it because I was concerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't think it is fairly presented. The only other point that I wanted to make is that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will basically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a near wholesale application of Chapman on collateral review. As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many times Petitioners come to court and they have a case where there was no finding of constitutional error in State court and therefore no Chapman application, but they're going to assert that in Federal court. And so if in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then you really have reduced application of Brecht.
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51375 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.

I think that what   it's sort of like what we said earlier in the argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary ruling is a constitutional violation. I would say most of them are not. And this Court has not drawn a bright line of exactly where that is. So in many cases, this is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best. And so, therefore, the State court would not be going to a Chapman standard because it would not be finding error. And with that, I'm prepared to submit.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51379 # FALSE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The distinction between collateral review and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review for harmlessness in collateral review become the same standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it. That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this Court. He got Chapman review. They cited Chapman. They didn't cite it here. That's the only difference. Mr. Brecht came to this Court and said they unreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it again on habeas, and this Court said that there is a deep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral review and direct review and that distinction turns upon the fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a long record where difficult calls were made. It is to correct fundamental miscarriages of justice, grievous wrongs that have caused custody in violation of constitutional

MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If I can adopt Justice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this Court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of burden of persuasion.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51382 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But you do agree if it were in equipoise the State would have the burden?
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51383 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The tie would go to the prisoner, yes. Were it in equipoise, because the State would have the burden the State would lose. I don't think that's what happened in this case. I think what Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court and what the judge will say in, what the court said in O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially contributed to the jury's verdict? And that is essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very bottom when it said "The court doesn't find that there's an insufficient showing"   that's the same way of saying I haven't been persuaded   that the error contributed to the verdict. So I don't think that this case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it the burden of persuasion or the proper level of conviction on the part of the court. This court was not persuaded and that is all that matters. When the court is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner loses. The second question you asked was whether we have a position on application of Brecht, and we do. We've laid it out in our brief. We think that in no sense does this record support the notion, support the argument, that there was a substantial and injurious effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was excluded, talking about third party culpability. And that requires not just looking at what, in isolation, what evidence was in there about Mr. Hurtz. There was I think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him either say he did it or he was there or he was involved. But it requires looking at the whole record. And there were   the defense here was not a Hurtz versus Fry. This was a case where the defense did an excellent job. It was a well defended case, and threw up a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it bought on. In the third trial you had what you didn't had in the prior trials. You had ballistics evidence that linked his gun to the crime. You have his own admission, his own testimony, that he left the house that night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out in the truck that was seen at   a truck of the same type, that was seen at the crime scene.

It's hard for me to understand when that rises to the level of unconstitutionality. But if we assume that it did, you have the two courts that applied the Brecht standard here.

But what I will not concede   I will concede it's long, but I will not concede that the mere fact of length of deliberations says anything about if this one particular error in applying a balancing test substantially affected the verdict. I think the length of deliberations is so incredibly speculative.

Again, this is Federal habeas corpus before this Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court has in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were involved, was so   that simply disallowed the twelfth out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the verdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years after the crime. And yes, the jury   it was close in the sense that they worked a long hard time. But at the end of the day, they were unanimous. There's nothing close about unanimous. And I think it would be the wrong message to say that a jury that works as hard as this one did, did the readbacks, culled through this record

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51210 # FALSE # MR. HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The constitutional error that occurred in Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can result in a conviction of an innocent person. Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of that error or evaluated the effect of that error under the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard. Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple. In the California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional trial error that occurred in this case. Had that court complied with this Court's precedent, that court would have first identified the constitutional error that occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the effect of that error under the Chapman test. The failure of that court to do so, the unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings. It scarcely seems reasonable

And the fact of the matter is if he had filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that, it would have effectively been asking at that stage for a type of error correction. It scarcely seems logical that the scope of the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the constitutional violation that he suffered, that that should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable decision-making of the State appellate court in the

Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on   or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. Now, you know, why would there   what does he care whether   whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation? Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?

HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Scalia, that's the point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief here. And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit truncated, by the State appellate court. But it was not a Chapman analysis. And that failure of the State appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is contrary to this Court's precedent. It ignores Chapman, it also would be an attack on

Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation. Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?

HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't know that necessarily there has to be one standard of review for the other   for one or the other, Your Honor.

The State appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter of State law in this case. The court also concluded that there was no constitutional error. Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97 of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case. However, in making that alternative holding, the State appellate court, the California court, was applying what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent of the Kotteakos type standard.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51226 # TRUE # MR. HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, first of all, this case, since it has now been determined in the Federal courts that there was an underlying constitutional violation, does not present that question. We do   and I understand the position that you are raising, Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the logic there. I don't think the Court has to resolve that here. Some of the lower Federal courts have determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht standard has been completely supplanted. Some courts have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus is Esparza to lead to that conclusion. And that may very well be the case. However, I don't think the Court needs to ultimately address that proposition in this case.
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51227 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # As I read the Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review.

HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, collateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht, can result in a more deferential standard of harmless error inquiry.

However, a central theme of the Brecht decision was that there have been Chapman analysis conducted by the State appellate judiciary  
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51229 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, I guess that's where maybe we   is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard.

What I wonder, though, is why does the   how does this case present the issue you want to argue? I'm   Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that. As I understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right. And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing. There could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person. That means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals court finds no error. Now, we get over to the Federal court. And they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End of case. Now, where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and   I mean, when I   it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so complicated. How does this case raise it?

The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression on me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a different context, it's the same problem. He said, I originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could conscientiously say, although I consider the findings clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes from an agency. But when I think about it, I don't think there's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that this is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll reverse. I mean, I find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing is possible.
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51246 # TRUE # MR. HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I agree with you, Your Honor. It's angels on the pin of a needle, I guess is the phrase here, and this case may be a case where the difference between Chapman and Brecht could be of consequence. If you'd look at the district court's treatment of this case, at the district court level the court stated: "Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating actionable error," and that court is applying the Brecht standard. The district court states: "I cannot rule out prejudice in this case." So seemingly had that court applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in the district court. Likewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice even under the Brecht standard, and then we have the panel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the prejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples' testimony been admitted that would have substantially bolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence. That statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is harmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying the Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in Mr. Fry's

And to Justice Stevens' question, as you pointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard which this court adopted in Brecht is an exacting standard. And in applying that standard, if you'd look at this case, the Court's decisions, Sullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the jury. Here we have a jury in the third trial that deliberated for 23 court days after 29 court days

My answer to that is no, because Mr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman. And this Court could in this case simply decide this case on that very narrow question, like many court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply, Brecht or Chapman, when there has been no Chapman analysis in the State court or when there has been an objectively unreasonable Chapman analysis in the State court. Most courts confronted with that issue say, we don't need to decide the question here because either the error was plainly harmless under both of those standards or plainly not harmless under both of these standards. And I simply recounted the history of the litigation below in the Federal courts to point out that this could be a case where that make a difference. It seems like

It's not speaking to this case. Your first question presented is, if constitutional error in a State trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman or in Brecht? That's the first question. Very generalized. Second question: Does it matter which harmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I thought it meant, you know, is there any difference between the two standards? Don't you think that's fair reading of it.

And look at this case. If the error in this case can be deemed harmless under any standard, then what cannot? What is prejudice when you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury where nine days into the deliberations at least five of them voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty. They told the judge that they were at an impasse. This jury struggled mightily with this evidence.

In such a case, we think it's conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judge's   the jury's decision?

But that's my basic question in this case and it's a serious question. Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, and if I really try I can bring myself to understand this question. Regardless of what I think, could another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have thought the opposite? I can do that mentally. You try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm sorry. I admit it. Now, if that's the state of mind that I can get myself into   and I believe that's true of many judges   how do I write words that are realistic in this area?

And I don't quarrel at all with the way that the court described   said that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless error inquiry in the O'Neal case, that it doesn't fit to look at it in terms of the allocation of burden. I don't think that this case ultimately turns on that, except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted by the district court judge did state that he was looking to Mr. Fry to make the sufficient showing

And this Court may very well deem that to be necessary. But I think also that this Court fashioning a decision which is faithful to the requirement that   or the principle that Kotteakos is an exacting standard, would also be an important constitutional principle. In a case like this, where there has been no Chapman review and where the Chapman court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error standard in order to safeguard convictions, safeguard against erroneous convictions where there is a close question of guilt or innocence, that hasn't happened in this case and it would be appropriate for this Court to fashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure that that happens.

The same concern, Justice Ginsburg, holds over in certain limited 2255 cases. If I may save the balance of my time.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51288 # FALSE # MR. MOODY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal habeas is limited in scope and purpose. It is not a continuation of the appellate process. Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State sovereignty. In Brecht, this court held that the stringent Chapman standard was inappropriate for use on collateral review. Instead, in order to strike a proper balance between State and Federal interests, the actual prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect on the verdict should be used in collateral cases. Petitioner is asking for an exception to this rule. He claims that if he did not receive Chapman review in State court, he should receive it on Federal habeas. That was not the rule in Brecht and it should not be adopted by this Court here. The Brecht decision did not state an exception based on the State standard used. The key in Brecht was that appropriate balance between the Federal Government and the State. This Court has never treated cases where there was not a state Chapman finding differently from other cases. It applies Brecht throughout. In the Penry case and in the O'Neal case there was no Chapman finding in state court, yet this Court applied Brecht and made no comment about that.

This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG in the briefs. He states them very well. The first is let's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded. Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of   an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence. So that's their finding on the merits. Then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. How could both those things be true? How could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? That's one thing they say. But the exclusion was harmless. I just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51300 # TRUE # MR. MOODY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that the explanation is as follows. When you're analyzing the denial of a defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first look to see how it fit into the defense. And that is what they were doing. You're not looking at the entire case. You're looking only at the defense. And so in the sense that something is better than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven may improve the defense case. And yet nonetheless, when you move to the next question, which is, was there a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking at everything that was available to the jury   it may be that there was still so much other evidence that it could overcome whatever increase you received on the defense.

Even applying Brecht clear. And you know what I'm getting at. I mean, five weeks of deliberation. The question after, whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51374 # TRUE # MR. MOODY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. I briefed it because I was concerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't think it is fairly presented. The only other point that I wanted to make is that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will basically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a near wholesale application of Chapman on collateral review. As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many times Petitioners come to court and they have a case where there was no finding of constitutional error in State court and therefore no Chapman application, but they're going to assert that in Federal court. And so if in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then you really have reduced application of Brecht.
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51375 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.

I think that what   it's sort of like what we said earlier in the argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary ruling is a constitutional violation. I would say most of them are not. And this Court has not drawn a bright line of exactly where that is. So in many cases, this is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best. And so, therefore, the State court would not be going to a Chapman standard because it would not be finding error. And with that, I'm prepared to submit.

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51379 # FALSE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The distinction between collateral review and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review for harmlessness in collateral review become the same standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it. That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this Court. He got Chapman review. They cited Chapman. They didn't cite it here. That's the only difference. Mr. Brecht came to this Court and said they unreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it again on habeas, and this Court said that there is a deep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral review and direct review and that distinction turns upon the fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a long record where difficult calls were made. It is to correct fundamental miscarriages of justice, grievous wrongs that have caused custody in violation of constitutional

arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51381 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If I can adopt Justice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this Court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of burden of persuasion. We accept O'Neal's holding what then there is equipoise, which did not what happened in this case, the tie goes to  
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51382 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But you do agree if it were in equipoise the State would have the burden?
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51383 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The tie would go to the prisoner, yes. Were it in equipoise, because the State would have the burden the State would lose. I don't think that's what happened in this case. I think what Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court and what the judge will say in, what the court said in O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially contributed to the jury's verdict? And that is essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very bottom when it said "The court doesn't find that there's an insufficient showing"   that's the same way of saying I haven't been persuaded   that the error contributed to the verdict. So I don't think that this case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it the burden of persuasion or the proper level of conviction on the part of the court. This court was not persuaded and that is all that matters. When the court is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner loses. The second question you asked was whether we have a position on application of Brecht, and we do. We've laid it out in our brief. We think that in no sense does this record support the notion, support the argument, that there was a substantial and injurious effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was excluded, talking about third party culpability. And that requires not just looking at what, in isolation, what evidence was in there about Mr. Hurtz. There was I think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him either say he did it or he was there or he was involved. But it requires looking at the whole record. And there were   the defense here was not a Hurtz versus Fry. This was a case where the defense did an excellent job. It was a well defended case, and threw up a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it bought on. In the third trial you had what you didn't had in the prior trials. You had ballistics evidence that linked his gun to the crime. You have his own admission, his own testimony, that he left the house that night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out in the truck that was seen at   a truck of the same type, that was seen at the crime scene.

It's hard for me to understand when that rises to the level of unconstitutionality. But if we assume that it did, you have the two courts that applied the Brecht standard here.

Again, this is Federal habeas corpus before this Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court has in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were involved, was so   that simply disallowed the twelfth out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the verdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years after the crime. And yes, the jury   it was close in the sense that they worked a long hard time. But at the end of the day, they were unanimous. There's nothing close about unanimous.

Two cases. A, Hurtz did not testify at all. B, he did. Is the foundation ruling any different in the two cases insofar as Maples' testimony or is it the same? I.e., is there a lesser showing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?
arguments in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler # 06-5247 # 51418 # TRUE # MR. HALTOM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that possibly the foundation with Hurtz there could be increased. The jury sought Mr. Hurtz.

The jury actually saw him. They heard a truck driver describing, a neutral truck driver, describing the actual killer, who in no way fit the description of Mr. Fry. Unfortunately, the record doesn't indicate what Mr. Hurtz looked like, but the jury saw it. And if the jury saw that that truck driver was describing a man that looked like Mr. Hurtz, then that

However, Ms. Maples' testimony was not, and counsel did not argue that heavily focused on Mr. Hurtz' guilt. She certainly did argue it, but the reason that she didn't is because, as the Court of Appeals, the California Court of Appeals, said, the other seven witnesses who said Mr. Hurtz said he had killed the Bells were all described as having been flimsy witness who gave contradictory unbelievable testimony.

PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1995 Congress acted decisively to curb abusive private securities litigation. It took the extraordinary step of rejecting categorically the traditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that are filed under the securities laws. Instead it declared that, and this is at page 2 of our petition, "The complaint shall state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind." The fundamental error in the court of appeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the statute the strong inference language that Congress clearly intended to be not only in those statutes, but obviously applied rigorously.

arguments in case 06-484, Tellabs, Inc. versus Makor Issues & Rights # 06-484 # 50983 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think the answer to the question is that it does not have to be the same. I think Congress actually has greater authority in dealing with pleadings that is distinct from the Seventh Amendment right, but the Court doesn't need to go that far in this particular case because I think the inferences that we are asking the Court to draw from the record in this case would avoid any

arguments in case 06-484, Tellabs, Inc. versus Makor Issues & Rights # 06-484 # 50987 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it's important as a standard of allegation, because what we're talking about here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers, and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the plaintiffs. So I do think it's removed. I mean, this Court has really never addressed the issue of the extent to which the Seventh Amendment extends to pleadings. And I don't think this is the case in which to take up that issue because I think it is quite clear that what at least we're asking for as the appropriate interpretation of the Reform Act is that you need to apply   that you simply follow Matushita and Monsanto, and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that innocent explanations can be set aside. And if you take that particular approach, which clearly is consistent with the Seventh Amendment, then it seems to me you   the Seventh that you followed under the Constitution, is eliminated.

But you're stating two different claims. The claim that must be stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be proved, and I don't know of any other instance where that is so.

And the words come out of, as I understand it, a Second Circuit decision. So I would think the most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied. But your definition of strong inference is quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.
arguments in case 06-484, Tellabs, Inc. versus Makor Issues & Rights # 06-484 # 50991 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I'm not sure that's 100 percent true. I think the real problem with the Second Circuit is there's no monolithic Second Circuit rule that's out there. The Second Circuit applied a number of cases under its particularity standards under 9(b) prior to the time Congress adopted the strong inference standard. Some of them   I think we would be very comfortable with the analysis in Shields versus Citytrust Bank, for instance. The way Judge Jacobs analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way we're trying to analyze the complaint in this case. So if you

I don't have to make that argument here because it's clear to me that the same standards of Matushita and Monsanto that say you have to exclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary judgment stage as we're trying to apply at the pleading stage, so there is no disconnect. But if I were actually forced into that position, I think I would take that view, although I probably would argue first that the standard of Huddleston ought to be reconsidered, rather than rejecting clearly what Congress had in mind in 1995 when it acted to curb the abuses of private securities litigation.

You're arguing for, in effect, an   an ultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct. And aren't you asking for more than just what Matsushita did at   at that later stage?

PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think there may be a slight semantic difference there, but the truth is at end of the day all we're asking for the Court to do is to evaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the negative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities, interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you traditionally do, take into account whether there is an allegation of motive, and say at the end of the day whether or not that reaches a   rises to the level of a strong inference.

PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, if I'm going to err on either side, I obviously prefer that the Court carries out Congress's intent. We thing you needn't go any further than Matsushita did in order to reverse the court of appeals in this particular case. Obviously there is probably some potential distance between the two, where you could certainly interpret the strong inference standard more in the line the way the United States interprets it, as creating a high likelihood of scienter. And we don't   we're certainly not objecting to that. We're just saying to the Court that you needn't go that far in order to decide this case, although obviously we would welcome a ruling along those lines if the Court's inclined to go that far.

It's the same problem you get with the 5500, where the court of appeals specifically said it is quite plausible that Mr. Notebaert never saw those reports. Now how you can make that concession and nevertheless say there is a strong inference that he acted to deceive, strikes me as absolutely implausible.

As a cornerstone of its effort in the Reform Act to address the problem of abusive actions, Congress adopted uniform and more stringent pleading requirements including the strong inference requirement at issue in this case. The court of appeals erred by holding that a plaintiff can satisfy that requirement simply by alleging facts which an inference of state of mind could be drawn. The court of appeals thereby misinterpreted the Reform Act. And

SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # First of all to be clear, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't believe that the Court needs to address that question in this case, because we don't believe that that sort of disparity would present any Seventh Amendment concerns. However, if the Court does believe that any disparity in the degree of probability required does present Seventh Amendment concerns, we believe that it is more consistent with Congress's intent to apply the strong inference requirement at the proof stage as well as the pleading stage rather than to water down the strong inference requirement that Congress adopted at the pleading stage. And we believe that that requirement does impose a very high burden. In our view, it requires a plaintiff to allege facts that give rise to a high likelihood that the conclusion that the defendant acted with the necessary date of mind follows from those allegations.

It has been the understanding that when there is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the complaint and you construe the allegations in that complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Is that rule not applied under the interpretation you are giving us of strong inference?
arguments in case 06-484, Tellabs, Inc. versus Makor Issues & Rights # 06-484 # 51055 # TRUE # MR. SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that it is, Justice Ginsburg, to this limited extent. In an ordinary civil case, the case is governed of course by Rule 8. And in some sense the rule that the allegations in the complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff is really derived from Rule 8 and its requirement that a plaintiff need only provide a shortened claim statement of the relevant underlying facts in order to survive a motion to dismiss. What Congress did in the Reform Act was to require first of all some degree of particularity in allegation; but Congress went further than that; and to the extent that Congress spoke in terms of the inferences that can be drawn from those allegations, we do believe that Congress abrogated the background rule that the allegations must be read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, or as some courts have put it, that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the complaint should be drawn in the plaintiff's favor. That clearly is a change on the preexisting law; and it is a change with regard to the law that circuits were applying before the enactment of the Reform Act.

SHANMUGAM # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I guess, Justice Souter, that I would wonder what it would mean to say that you read the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. If what it means is that a plaintiff can simply accumulate reasonable subsidiary inferences in order to create the strong inference of state of mind that is ultimately required, then I think I would disagree that that rule remains in effect. Precisely because our view is that in applying the strong inference standard, a court should consider other possible explanations for the defendant's conduct that are not foreclosed by the allegations

No. Again, I come back to the notion that what the Seventh Circuit did is look at the 5500, look at the 6500, look at the earnings projections which proved false, looked at back-dating, channel stuffing.

Congress did not change the proof in private actions. Congress did not change all of the background procedure like the background procedure in Jones and   it is just not there yet. Congress did change a couple of Federal rules explicitly. So I, I cannot comprehend how, if the case reached the jury, you would have to charge above predominance.

And in the first instance, it seems to me quite clear that the Seventh Circuit did not apply the strong inference standard. If   you can compare the language from the First Circuit circuit that specifically says it has to be reasonable and strong, strong has completely fallen out here. I don't see any way to read it the other way. I think in response to Justice Breyer's question, which is how do, how should you write the opinion, I think the meaningful way to write the opinion is to be respectful of Justice Scalia's desire to provide guidance. So I do think you should say, you have to, as Justice Alito said, review the entirety of the document and   and infer both positively and negatively as you go forward. We know that has to be true. Almost every court that's dealt with these issues

There's no question that that's   that that's what Congress had to have meant under these circumstances. And the best example of that is the CEO who sells securities during the time period of the class action. There are dozens of cases in which that happens. Does it create an inference of scienter? It might, because it's quite possible that he sold and   he lied about the stock in order to keep the price up to sell. It is also possible that he sells only about 1 percent of the stock

So I was just saying you can't start sweeping everything in. But   and it is true, the court distinguished between those two individuals; but the bottom line remains the same.

arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50766 # FALSE # MR. OLSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The per se illegality rule for resale price maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated, misguided and anticompetitive. It should be replaced with the same rule of reason standard that applies to other forms of vertically imposed marketing restrictions. The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a restraint is unreasonable. Per se rules should be rare and imposed only where the court is virtually certain based upon considerable economic experience that a practice is nearly invariably anticompetitive. Vertical minimum retail   resale price maintenance are plainly not invariably anticompetitive. In fact, a broad consensus of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that vertical restraints promote interbrand competition, which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely, if ever, anticompetitive.
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50767 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # There was an argument made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves, in which case some might have held back.
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50768 # TRUE # MR. OLSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the economists who have looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case. It certainly could not be the case in this industry in connection with this participant in the marketplace. There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton products are sold through. There are thousands and thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of products. What the Court has said repeatedly is that programs such as this may promote interbrand competition, perhaps

arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50778 # TRUE # MR. OLSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that if the manufacturer makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of course relationships between the dealers and the manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in doing this, because they may find for the same reason that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of products. The record is clear in this case that this was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly competitive marketplace, and it was successful.

OLSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it might be a situation, the economists have written about this, say that it would be very rare, and would require retailers with a strong powerful market power to impose a situation where the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a horizontal cartel. That certainly was not involved in this case, and that would probably be found to violate the rule of reason. In addition, it would probably be unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this Court. That was not an issue in this case. The economists say that that would very seldom happen.

We have   you talked about   just for fun I got out of the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called resale price maintenance where he has five economists   now maybe you're not going to count them as economists. Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief as single argument that isn't in the book. There's one interesting thing about the book. It was written in 1966. So I guess my question is what's changed? Now I know two things have changed. One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain, and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices went down. That's changed. And the second thing that's changed is there's far more concentration, I gather, today in the retail side of the market than there are used to be, a factor which makes resale price maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take place at the request of the dealers. Now, I see those two changes. My question to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even on Google, and   what's changed? What's new?

And other things that have happened since then, are this Court's decision in the Sylvania case, which   which involved an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the ruling   the reason for a per se rule. This Court's decision in State Oil versus Khan, and the other cases that this Court is very well aware of where per se rules have systematically been dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the marketplace.

I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has said over and over again. If you   the purpose of the antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition, because competition between competing manufacturers give the consumers more choice. Some people may want the cheapest product. Some people may want the product that's more available to them. They may wish the return policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that the dealer provides. And in this marketplace particularly, that system of providing competition is consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced success in the marketplace.

I understand perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing differ things. Of course, resale price maintenance does raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive. Of course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that might help consumers. Now, in addition, you need clear rules. Now those three sets of things require a balance. And we have a hundred years of history where this Court and Congress and others have balanced those three sets of considerations, and they've come out one way. Now, the Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come out the other way. There are good arguments on both sides. Why should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the absence of any   any   congressional indication that that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a difficult area of people reaching a slightly different weight on some these three sets of things?

arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50837 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Certainly not, Your Honor. Because that, that is almost always anticompetitive in our experience and in the experience of the courts. But the same is not true in the resale price maintenance context. Dr. Miles has foreclosed the courts from conducting the kind of analysis that would actually look into this question. But the empirical data that are available would suggest that anticompetitive explanations for resale price maintenance do not have very much explanatory power. When you actually look at the cases that have been litigated, they involve manufacturers without market power, unconcentrated markets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases of any cartelization going on. So the anticompetitive explanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do not appear to explain most of the retail price maintenance that has been litigated. It's true that retail price maintenance can but does not always result in price increases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out, price is not the only thing that consumers care about. And there is widespread consensus in the economic literature and in this Court's recent cases that price-based vertical restraints, just like non-price based vertical restraints, while they generally reduce intrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand competition. In Monsanto and Business Electronics, this Court made clear that price vertical restraints, like minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in fact usually, have the same or similar effects to the non-price vertical restraints to which this Court now applies rule of reason analysis. So the reason in

arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50856 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But doesn't that answer your argument that there isn't reason to believe that there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes, because now it's going to be easy?
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50857 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, in 1945 during the height of the fair trade era the FTC did a study which concluded only about 5 percent of the economy was affected by fair trade. And the fair trade regime, remember, is a different and more extreme regime. There it was per se legality, not rule of reason. So it's just   there's just no basis for these assertions that somehow the economy is going to be massively changed. But it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance. It will enhance its ability to compete and it will provide consumers more of what they want, and that is a good thing and the antitrust laws should not automatically foreclose that merely because in a small percentage of cases it is conceivable that there can be anticompetitive effects.

It will be a horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to give the retailer as much   more money than the retailer is now making. He's going to try to keep their margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell as many of his products as possible consistent with his desire to sell his product by attaching to it more service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever. You know, horizontal conspiracy, the incentives are entirely different. When you're dealing with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is still to keep the price as low as possible consistent with the additional good that he wants to give consumers to attract those consumers to his product.

Retail price maintenance also has the problem we discussed earlier of perpetuating incumbent forms of distribution at the expense of the innovative and more efficient distribution means.

And again, I would suggest that perhaps if the Court doesn't reach that, it should remand to the Fifth Circuit for them to consider whether that is a possibility. Resale price maintenance can distort consumer choice. The retailers   so the person comes into the store   the retailers can exercise pressure to influence the selection of higher margin products over ones that may better fit the consumer needs. That is an evil of resale price maintenance, whether or not it does promote efficiencies. And if resale price maintenance does act as it is theorized, to increase retailer services, some consumers will be worse off, they'll be paying for services they don't want.

They sign a contract to provide that service. If they don't want to provide that service, they don't sign the contract, these don't get the goods. It's as simple as that. If the question is providing a larger margin to the dealer, the most efficient way is for the manufacturer simply to lower their wholesale price, and the margin the dealer receives is higher. Again, if there are other efficiencies, they might be achieved by exclusive territories as permitted by Sylvania or by the Colgate doctrine. I would suggest the experience of the 30 years following the elimination of the fair trade laws have shown the wisdom of the Dr. Miles decision which places faith in the free market system. This Court should continue to honor its precedents and respect the will of Congress by adhering to the Dr. Miles rule.

arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50935 # FALSE # MS. UNDERWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a manufacturer agrees with its retailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point of the agreement is to prevent price competition among retailers, to prevent discounts. For almost 100 years the Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act to prohibit such price fixing agreements. Any change in that fundamental understanding of the statute should be made by Congress and not by this Court. The per se rule against resale price maintenance is different in at least three ways from other antitrust rules that this Court has overturned. First, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled law for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by this Court.
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50936 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, it's also been settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more inefficiently.

UNDERWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. That tension that you   that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a result of the fact that the antitrust rule   law does not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior. It prohibits agreements that are anti   that restrain competition. And so it will often be the case that it is possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that line because of a different value, a value in preserving the independent action of individuals. It is, however  
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50938 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I'm not sure it's often the case. Give me some other examples where you can achieve the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50939 # TRUE # MS. UNDERWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, as you have observed, virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing function and become one entity instead of two entities. Then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates the whole function, is   can fix prices, fix his, what are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of the antitrust laws. There are other reasons why a manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid the prohibitions of the antitrust law. It is also   so, this is old and well settled. Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it was established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years after it was established, this has a much more settled pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up around it. Second, it was endorsed and relied on by Congress, not enacted by Congress but endorsed and relied on by Congress, when Congress repealed the fair trade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this Court is now asked to interpret.

arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50943 # TRUE # MS. UNDERWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. The legislative history described in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's brief shows that actually they were returning the law to the per se rule against resale price maintenance because they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should be prohibited. This is   it is also true that  
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50944 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But of course, they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear. They didn't do that here.
arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50945 # TRUE # MS. UNDERWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's true, they did not do that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has established in the antitrust area, this rule has received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn the rule should be at its peek as compared with those other rules. And third, price is different. This Court has said that price competition is the central nervous system of the economy. Other restraints, to be sure, might indirectly affect price, but not with the same absolute force. Territorial restraints don't absolutely prevent price competition because customers can travel or order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under territorial restraints there are often multiple retailers in a particular territory who can compete. Maximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at all unless, as the Court noted in Khan, it's really Minimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which case the Court in Khan said it's illegal. Manufacturers can of course pay retailers for the services that enhance the product that are being advanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price maintenance. But the question for this Court is whether the manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing agreement to make that payment to buy those services, and that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide in a rule of reason trial. That's a question of statutory interpretation for this Court. It's a question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer can use to buy those retailer services. It's also true that the claim that price-fixing works to induce those services is both debatable and untested. The retailers have no obligations to provide services under the retail price maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other cases.

OLSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The Respondent and its amici seem to recognize that what this Court said in State Oil versus Khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand competition on matters of service and availability and other things in addition to price. The Respondent and their amici seem to have acknowledged these pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a Colgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a blunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with which you had a relationship for years, it prohibits even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small problems.

arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated # 06-480 # 50974 # TRUE # MR. OLSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. What we're suggesting is that the agreement is something, the details can be worked out. The manufacturer can   and the Ping brief explains this. The manufacturer can go to the retailer and say: Look, maybe you didn't get it right, your sales person said the wrong thing; let's fix it, because we want to be dealing together. The antitrust laws   in other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or they suggest forward integration, so you just acquire all your retailers. The benefits of these type of arrangements provide the consumers with choices. It stimulates interbrand competition. It promotes intrabrand competition on things other than price. It provides consumers with more choices. It ultimately gives more freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its products, to enter the marketplace. These are things that the Court has said, and provides a more varied market price. The court has repeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of reason. Per se rules should be crossed out or not adopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is invariably anticompetitive. This practice, as acknowledged, is procompetitive. It provides many opportunities, and it is irrational for vertical restrictions to exist in this world in the non-price area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a rigid per se rule that cannot be changed. And as this Court has repeatedly held, Congress intended by the use of restraint of trade and the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the benefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do something that's rational in the marketplace, to give consumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that is a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare makes no sense at all. For all those reasons, the rule of reason in this area, as in the other areas, should replace the per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the end of the day. Thank you.

argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50515 # FALSE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT #  # We'll hear argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver. Ms. Spillars.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50517 # FALSE # MS. SPILLARS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While this Court has laid out a framework for reviewing prosecutors' closing arguments, the fairness standard established in Donnelly and Darden is by its nature a very general standard. Under this Court's interpretation of AEDPA, the State court should therefore be provided more leeway in reaching outcomes. Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit afforded no deference to the Missouri Supreme Court's decision. Instead, its improperly substituted its own evaluation for the comments, looking at each of them in isolation and without considering the totality of the proceedings. That decision was wrong not only because the court of appeals failed to properly afford deference to the State court, but because when viewed within the entire proceedings the prosecutor's closing arguments did not deprive the Respondent of a fair trial. Applying AEDPA correctly, the Missouri Supreme Court decision was well within reason given, one, the nonspecific standard of fundamental fairness and the fact that this Court has never applied that standard to a penalty phase closing argument; and, two, because, considering the record in the entire proceedings of this case, the Respondent was not deprived of fundamental fairness.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50518 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, we didn't   haven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument, but we've certainly applied the general standard to the penalty phase.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50519 # TRUE # MS. SPILLARS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct, Your Honor. And it's certainly is not our argument that it would not apply to the penalty phase. However, there simply may be other considerations, because the fundamental fairness standard essentially answers the question, did the jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they base it improperly on the prosecutor's comments.

SPILLARS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # To help answer the question, though, in that context, Donnelly and Darden set down some general considerations that, while not exclusive, help provide the post and beams of the fundamental fairness standard. So even assuming that all of the statements were improper, those considerations when applied to this case show that the trial was not rendered unfair because of the prosecutor's argument. First, none of the comments misstated the evidence nor did they misstate the law.

argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50530 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I mean, they'd be improper because they   they were based on an emotional appeal that's improper?
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50531 # TRUE # MS. SPILLARS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It could be improper in the sense that it was a misstatement of evidence. I don't know that impropriety would include necessarily emotional appeal. I mean, the Constitution does not require a trial devoid of emotion. However, impropriety under Donnelly and Darden was the first tier of the multi-tier kind of Fundamental fairness test. So even assuming that that first tier, that the statements were improper, they still did not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness. Secondly, none of the individual comments implicated the defendant's rights under the Fifth or Sixth Amendment, nor were they of the very specific kind of comments that this Court has found to violate the Eighth Amendment under Caldwell.

Why is it improper for, for the prosecution to argue that, given the facts of this case, given the aggravating factors and the lack of mitigating factors, the brutality of the crime, the only sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of the jury is the death penalty? That's an improper argument? Doesn't that amount to saying you have a duty to come back with the death penalty? Why can't the prosecution argue that?
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50543 # TRUE # MS. SPILLARS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It's certainly not improper to make statements based on inferences from the evidence.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50544 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, do you think the Patton argument has anything to do with the evidence? I mean, the Patton argument   correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the argument that referred to General Patton was an argument that, number one, talked about his addressing the troops before battle. And he was telling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes their duty to kill. And he said: Go out there and do your duty, which I assume any reasonable listener would say, go out there and kill. If a prosecutor, as in this case, tells that story and uses that analogy, it seems to me that the argument is not an argument based on evidence, but an argument based upon the situation, the situation of the jurors vis a vis a capital defendant. And I would suppose that the reasonable inference from the argument is that they have a duty to go out there to kill, to impose the death penalty. That does not sound to me like an argument based upon the evidence specific to this defendant and specific to this case. Now, am I wrong?

It certainly was not a statement on the evidence in sense of was it a discussion of the facts in the case.

argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50546 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I don't understand your concession. Surely, the prosecutor was not telling this jury that in all capital cases you have to come in with a death verdict. Surely, although he didn't explicitly mention the evidence, the underlying premise of his argument was sometimes when you have a case this bad, you have to do your duty. Nobody likes to kill, but just as soldiers sometimes have to do that if that's their duty, so also jurors, if you really believe that the evidence is so one-sided in favor of the penalty that the State is asking for, it's your duty to bring the death verdict. I don't see anything wrong with that.

When I look at the whole picture   I've actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared. And what he did, he went through this and looked at a case called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor. And the prosecutor was told in that case just what he shouldn't do. And now if we look what he did in this case and look what he did in that case and look at the law, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks like he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to do. You're not supposed to give an argument that vouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is what you should do. So in Newlon he says: I'm talking to you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top law enforcement officer. And here he says: I'm the top law enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we have the death penalty and not. Worse than Newlon, I would say. Then what you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers. I mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell them you're like a soldier doing duty. At least that's what all these prosecutors   a case called Byron versus the United States. So in Newlon what he says is: I want to impress on you, this is a war and it's justifiable to kill in war. Here he says: As in the movie "Patton" and in the movie George Patton is talking to his troops because they're going out in battle like the soldiers. And then he says: And when you're a soldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a pile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's face; you'll know what to do; and last July this defendant's face was a pile of goo. Okay, there we are. I mean, that sounds pretty emotional. It sounds like a soldier does his duty and you're doing it. And then another thing you're not supposed to do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their duty to the community. And this is just filled with instances where you hardly even know that there's a person called Weaver because he says: What you have to do here is send a message to the drug lords, send a message

It says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes you've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk death because it's right. His point is that at some point, at some times, you have to impose death because it's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier. Now, where is the reference to you have this duty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?

The decision   when he tried this case, it was approximately five weeks after the district court in Newlon had come down with the decision. And there are statements that he made in Newlon and Shurn that were not in this case. For example, in Newlon he said this is the worst case ever and in Shurn he said the same thing.

There was also no mechanism in this case for the jury to apply any of the improper remarks to their deliberations because they were properly instructed. Instructions which we presume that they followed. In this case, the court read the instructions to the jury before closing arguments, and a copy was also given to the jury to deliberate with. Four of those instructions, numbers 21, 28, 26, and 27, told the jury in various forms that it was their duty, and theirs alone, to render a verdict. The jury was also told in instructions 23, 24, and 26 that it was   that their decision must be within the confines of the evidence. And thirdly, within the specific process laid out for finding ways   mitigating and aggravating circumstances. And finally, the last instruction that the jury heard before closing arguments was that closing arguments were not evidence. It is counterintuitive to assume that the jury disregarded those instructions as a whole and instead improperly relied on the prosecutor's closing argument when they declined to find the one aggravating circumstance that the prosecutor spoke most about. At appendix 285 is the part of the closing argument where the prosecutor discussed the aggravating circumstances. He argued to the jury that all four applied, but spent most time speaking about number one, which was that he had killed for money. However, the jury did not find aggravator number 1. So the very aggravator that the prosecutor argued most about to the jury, they did not find. It's more reasonable to conclude that the jury made its decision based on the strength of the evidence and the strong evidence in support of the death penalty. Having rejected the misidentification defense, the jury necessarily found that the respondent was the passenger who had returned to the woods to shoot the victim several more times.

BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: As the former prosecutor's brief makes clear, George "Buzz" Westfall's penalty phase closing argument in Mr. Weaver's case contained a number of improper and mutually reinforcing statements which exploited the authority of his office, analogized the jury's duties to that of soldiers in war time, injected extraneous matters into the proceedings, and appealed to the jurors' passions and prejudice.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50636 # TRUE # JUSTICE ALITO # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I think they overstated the significance of Viereck. Isn't Viereck   does Viereck stand, do you think, for a per se rule that a prosecutor in a closing argument may never mention the word soldier? Isn't that a much more limited   much more limited holding? This was a prosecution during World War II of individuals for failing to register as agents of Nazi Germany, and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase   and it wasn't a capital case obviously, in the guilt phase of closing argument, that just as our soldiers who are fighting the Japanese on the Bataan Peninsula are doing their duty for the country, you have a duty to return a guilty verdict against these individuals. Now, isn't that very different from saying that in a capital   at the capital phase of the trial, you have a duty to consider something that's very unpleasant, and it's unpleasant in the same way that what soldiers have to do in war time is different? Isn't that very different?
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50637 # TRUE # MR. BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think the historical context is different, but this was set up in this case by informing the jurors that we were involved in a war, in a war on drugs in society.

Not only in the broader context and the repeated   the prosecutor repeatedly leveraging the power of his office behind this, but this came right on the heels of him saying, I'm the top law enforcement officer in this county.

But that doesn't mean it's irrelevant for the due process totality of circumstances analysis. And then he proceeds from there directly in to the Patton analogy, and I think if you read that analogy in context, he is telling them you're soldiers in a war, you have a duty to kill, I'm like Patton, I'm telling you it's your duty to kill, go kill.

Yes, there are the Jenner cases that establish the general principles, but the question is how clearly those were contravened before you can say it violated clearly established law.

The first is that any State court decision finding this argument in its totality based on what happened and based on the weight of the evidence in this case that said that didn't render the proceedings fundamentally unfair would be an unreasonable application of Darden and Donnelly. But in addition to that, the Missouri Supreme Court in this case said the decision was unreasonable because it failed to consider significant portions of Mr. Weaver's challenge to this argument. It did the analysis under a State law abuse of discretion standard, and it refused to consider or failed to consider several components of his claim.

This case goes far beyond William Weaver. This touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the world. That's the message you have to send. It just doesn't pertain to William Weaver. It pertains to all of us, the community. The message   there are street, et cetera. Okay. Now. That struck me, as you argue this is rather extreme. Its seems to be removing the attention of the jury from William Weaver and saying you have a duty to send this man for other reasons. Now   to execute him. But where do I find in the U.S. reports the case or statement that then says this is the kind of argument the prosecutor cannot make?
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50690 # TRUE # MR. BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Okay. Let me   I want to back up, and I want to take on the premise of the question. Which may be a mistake, but I think in determining, the first part of the Donnelly/Darden standard is you look at what the prosecutor argued and whether it was improper. I don't believe you have to have a United States Supreme Court case directly on point for everything the prosecutor said on that. There are decisions from this Court on a number of things he said. There are also other touchstones, for example, the standards on criminal justice which regulate what prosecutors can say. Then the way I understand this clearly established Federal law to work, is you take what the prosecutor said, you examine that in light of what happened, what defense counsel did, what the trial judge did, and the weight of the overall evidence. And if you believe that the prosecutor's arguments rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair, then there's a violation of the due process clause. I don't think I have   you have to show that there's some Supreme Court case directly on point going to each particular comment.

argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50692 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Even   even the Supreme Court cases going to the other points, they didn't   did any of them involve a separate penalty phase? They were all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital case, weren't they?
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50693 # TRUE # MR. BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well  
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50694 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So that, so that when the prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging the jury to find a person guilty. He was not just urging them what penalty is better or worse. He was saying for these reasons you should find the individual guilty. That's quite different it seems to me from the situation in which guilt has already been established. The trial's done. This person is guilty, and the only thing they're arguing about is what the penalty ought to be. I'm not sure that you can analogize, you know, from the one situation to the other in determining what kind of argument is proper. Because in the former situation when the   if the prosecutor says this is not just about this defendant, it's about the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the person guilty. I mean   and that's crazy. You don't find the person guilty in order to stop drug trafficking. But you do impose a heavier penalty in order to do that. So I just don't, don't see the analogy from the Supreme Court cases you have.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50695 # TRUE # MR. BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think that, I don't see any reason why a principle which this Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed to leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office behind a particular outcome, would apply any less at the penalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase of a capital trial.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50696 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That's different. Look   it could   could   would defense counsel be able to argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an ordinary trial where there's no separate phase, "ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large family that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch. You shouldn't find him guilt. Is there no mercy in your heart?" Would he be allowed to argue that? Of course not. Can he argue it in a guilt phase? Of course he can. And it seems to me in determining what arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided by what arguments the defense can make. The defense can surely come in and say ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called upon to kill somebody. Do you realize what a   what a difficult, overwhelming thing that is? And then you say the prosecution can't come in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do your duty, you have to kill. This is the law here. If you find the facts this way, that's your duty. I   I   I think you're, you're taking hard cases very much out of context by applying cases that relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure that we've set up in capital cases which is called the guilt   uh, the penalty phase.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50697 # TRUE # MR. BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I disagree with that, and to this extent. Can a lawyer in a capital case argue at the sentencing phase of the capital trial you should not sentence this person to death because they've had a hard life? Yes. Of course you can. And why can you do that? Because according to this Court's cases, that goes directly to the individual's moral culpability and whether they deserve the death penalty. The problem with many of the arguments which were made in this case is they are fundamentally inconsistent with the individual's moral blameworthiness and they can the jury to impose the death penalty in order to stop larger issues, to stop crime, to protect society.

And this sentencing phase isn't about just   just isn't about William Weaver. It is about sending a message to the others. And if you execute him, even if you think he shouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should be, but, you see, others will think that this is a message. So do it just to give a message. Even if you think he never did it. No matter what you think of him, you think he's the best person in the world. Still execute him just to send a message. Now would that violate the Constitution?

BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think, you know, at some point, right, you can say well, you don't have a case on point because no one has said anything so outrageous. If a prosecutor went up and said look, ladies and gentlemen, the judge is going to tell you about aggravating and mitigating circumstances; forget all that baloney, go in there, you know, put all that out of your brain, and give him death. I don't think there would be any question  
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50716 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The question has been switched here, Counsel. The question before us is not whether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty of Supreme Court precedent, even though none on these particular facts, to convince me that he shouldn't have said it. That's not the question before us. The question before us is whether it violates fundamental unfairness, whether it's wrong to such an extent that it invalidates the whole prosecution and   and sentence. That's quite a different question. I can acknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't do it. But that doesn't lead me to the, automatically to the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence shows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that the, that the verdict has to be set aside.
argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50717 # TRUE # MR. BLUME # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, let me tackle that head-on. There were a number of improper comments made in this case. Most, many of them   a number of them were objected to and the objection was overruled. Some of them were not objected to. The only instructions they got were two curative instructions on two points and a general evidence, not arguments, instruction. So nothing was really done in the context to ameliorate the presence of these comments. And despite what the Petitioner says, this was not a strong case for death. The evidence of guilt was circumstantial and hotly contested. Even the prosecutor in his penalty phase acknowledged, look, he might be innocent, but kill him anyway. The State presented no additional evidence in aggravation of punishment. Mr. Weaver had no prior record other than a misdemeanor conviction. There was substantial mitigating evidence presented regarding his character, his good deeds, and other things he had done in the community and his adaptability to confinement. This was not a strong case for death. So you take these comments, which were   they're trying to contrast   this argument is worse than Newlon in most respects. It was made five weeks after he was told that this argument rendered another trial fundamentally unfair.

But to say that   and they found   and I'm not suggesting that that's not part of the totality of the proceedings. But there's one significant point there that also I think needs to be taken into account.

I'm suggesting that whether juries impose death often depends in part as well on the moral blameworthiness or how they perceived the victim. This was not like witness, an innocent witness. This was somebody who was involved in that. And that normally makes it more difficult for the prosecution to obtain a death sentence.

argument today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver # 06-313 # 50758 # FALSE # MS. SPILLARS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Your Honor. I would like to address two points. First, it is not clearly established that deterrence arguments in closing arguments are improper, and for good reason, particularly because of the strength of this   the evidence in this case and the fact that the Respondent had killed a Federal witness execution-style. To that extent, as I understand the Respondent's argument, the deterrence rises or falls on however the prosecutor has prefaced his deterrence argument, if he says certain words to mitigate the deterrence argument. However, trials don't operate in terms of specific words that must be pre-spoken before an argument can be valid. Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's question previously, I would advise that prosecutors should not use some arguments, not necessarily the deterrence argument, but not that in every instance they must not use those arguments. This Court's supervisory role in those kinds of cases allows this Court to turn should's into must's for Federal prosecutors, but that is not the case here. Second   thirdly, the Viereck case is in a historical context which we don't have here, and the Missouri Supreme Court did consider the penalty phase arguments. At page 237 of the appendix the court specifically said: "We have reviewed the penalty phase arguments." And then at page 235, the Missouri Supreme Court distinguishes Newlon and says that they do not rise to the level of the statements made in Newlon. So to that extent the Missouri State court was not an unreasonable application of this Court's precedents and deference should afforded to that State court decision. For that reason we would ask that this case be reversed. Thank you.

The   the hypothetical is, what if there is a sign or a statement in the school calling for a change in, you know, the prohibition against marijuana use? As a call for change in the law, I would suppose it was political speech. But as I understood the argument you were making, it would still be regarded as an exception, as it were, to Tinker, because it was disruptive. And it was disruptive in the sense that it disagreed with official school policy, which was to enforce the law or support the law as it was. Is that your position on what disruption means under Tinker?

That, in fact, is what is happening here. There is an effort of the   to prevent a message that is inconsistent with a fundamental message of the schools, which is the use of illegal drugs is simply verboten, and we believe that is permitted under Tinker

The Court can certainly decide this on very narrow grounds, that there are certain substances, illegal drugs, we would include alcohol and tobacco, that's part of the school's policy, because those are illegal substances which are very injurious to health. And this Court has noted that in Bernonia and in Earls, time and again, it is that these are very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy sanctioned by Congress, and also noted by courts across the country, that illegal drugs are so dangerous that schools are entitled to have a message going

I mean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum for political debate simply because the students want to put that on their agenda? Presumably the teacher's agenda is a little bit different and includes things like teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem, and just because political speech is on the student's agenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker so broadly as to include protection of those, that speech.

STARR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This Court has not read Tinker quite so broadly in both Frazier and in Kuhlmeier, and there are a couple of aspects of Tinker that I think are worthy of note.

But there might be a more difficult showing of disruption or inconsistency with the educational mission. That is what this Court articulated in Frazier and again in Kuhlmeier that the school is able under our policies of federalism and value of federalism and democratic theory to fashion its educational mission subject to constitutional safeguards. And that mission of preventing the schools from being infected with pro-drug messages continues wherever there is school jurisdiction, and that would include on a Saturday field trip or other kind of activity and I think that

If it's a school trip to an art museum, unfurling a 15 foot banner in front of the pictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object of the trip. Unfurling a banner in a classroom is going to be disruptive to the teaching of Shakespeare or whatever is supposed to be going on in there. What we have here is the unfurling of a banner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing snowballs waiting for some   somebody to run by with a TV camera nearby. And there is a real question as to whether, it seems to me, as to whether it is in a kind of practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything. And if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer favor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to favor the right to suppress it?

Let me, let me follow, actually ask you the same question on   on that. Because in response to Justice Scalia's question you said certainly that the school has got the right to have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling for violations of the law. Accepting that as a premise, don't we need, before the school may suppress the speech, don't we need at least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with that policy? And if that is so, is Bong Hits 4 Jesus inconsistent with it? It sounds like just a kid's provocative statement to me.

But I believe   I think it's important to recognize that this Court's precedents recognize   recognize several different justifications for restricting student speech. In Tinker itself which dealt with political speech, the Court was careful to point out that even then, if the speech could be shown to present a threat of a material disruption to the class work, and I think this would answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, if the teacher wants to teach Shakespeare, the teacher doesn't have to turn over the class to political speech.

argument first in case 06-278, Morse vs. Frederick # 06-278 # 50289 # TRUE # MR. KNEEDLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. No. And   and, and just to finish, in Tinker even with a viewpoint concern, the Court said if you could show material disruption, and   and the Court made that clear in Tinker, by, by its comparison to several lower court decisions where wearing buttons had been prohibited because they had caused disruption. And the third category in Tinker itself was where there would be an intrusion upon the rights of other students to be secure and be let alone. That's Tinker dealing with political speech. But in Frazier and Hazelwood the Court identified additional categories of speech that could be governed by the school, and this is in footnote 4 of Hazelwood. The Court made clear that the ability to regulate those categories of speech goes beyond the question of whether there would be disruption or whether there would be  
argument first in case 06-278, Morse vs. Frederick # 06-278 # 50290 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So   so you think that the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete button that says "legalize marijuana," although it might be covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it could be inconsistent with the school's mission and prohibited on that basis?

Given the fact that this is a First Amendment case, isn't a court forced into the position if it's going to be consistent with what else we have said, even at the final appellate level, of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the statement itself in determining whether it may be suppressed or punished? And if we do that, is it such a reasonable construction that this is an   an incitement to illegal drug use? I mean it's a statement which makes, makes the drug law look a little ridiculous, I think, but I'm not sure that that is very distinguishable from a statement saying "you ought to change the drug law."

Again, that's why I don't think there's any one single rule that governs all cases. This, this I think falls under the Frazier standard, where the Court said that, that schools have a duty to inculcate matters of civility and to prepare students for citizenship, and not violating the law is an important part of that and teachers' act in loco parentis. They act as guardians and they should be able to do, as this Court says in Earls, what a reasonable guardian would do. That would mean don't allow people to encourage lawbreaking.

This is Deborah Morse's interrogatory answer and there she sets forth the facts, and that bleeds into the law. To promote drugs   and this is our fundamental suggestion and submission. To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the basic educational mission of the school, and for this Court to suggest to the contrary would really be quite inconsistent with much of its drug jurisprudence, Bernonia and Earls. The opinion of the Court in Earls 2002 is especially powerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their dangers. More broadly, the Court does not need to go more broadly, but the Court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission. But we know that there are in fact constitutional limits. Those limits are captured in Tinker. A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.

Now, if that's a problem, what's the solution to that problem?
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49882 # TRUE # MR. GARRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Scalia, to bring an APA action to Federal court challenging the final decisions of the IBLA.

Every time there is another trespass he has to go all the way through the administrative procedure and then when the, when the administrative court says, well, it was okay, then he has to go through the regular Federal courts.

Just as a hypothetical, let's say they don't   the Government doesn't get its reciprocal easement that it wants, and so it says look, we normally don't strictly enforce these cattle trespass things, but we are going to go by the book with this guy until he gives us the right-of-way. Every time his cattle cross over the line we are going to hit him with a trespass citation. They don't do it for anybody else but, they're going to do it for him because they want to get the reciprocal right-of-way. Is that appropriate or inappropriate?
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49959 # TRUE # MR. GARRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, first I don't think it gives him a cause of action under Bivens or the Just Compensation Clause. Second

There is a certain amount of give and take that we think is inherent in these reciprocal arrangements and we think that the Just Compensation Clause tolerates.

That's why any unauthorized action by the Government is a trespass, which is, which is dealt with under State law. The Just Compensation

Why didn't he know about this possibility? Why didn't he know that his predecessor in title had granted?

argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49963 # TRUE # MR. GARRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think he was on notice.

argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49964 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That's a given in the record. The record is that he was not on notice. So whether one says, gee that's unlikely if he wasn't  
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49965 # TRUE # MR. GARRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But in any event, the point is that the BLM recognized that it had to negotiate a new reciprocal arrangement with Respondent and it sought to do so.

argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49969 # TRUE # MR. GARRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I, I don't think so, Your Honor. I think what is distinct about the Bivens claim here is first Bivens and Just Compensation Clause claims are fundamentally incompatible. And that in Bivens, its damages are nothing. Here the constitutional right actually explicitly provides a remedy, just compensation. Secondly, just compensation claims are claims against the Government.
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49970 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well that's because we assume it's focused just on his property and that the property was ultimately the thing that was in issue. But if you have all these other retaliatory actions, and wrongful actions taken by the Government tangential to this dispute, I take it Davis versus Passman, broadly read, says we can use Bivens if there is no other way to get a remedy against the Government.
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49971 # TRUE # MR. GARRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well   two points. First, Davis versus Passman was decided in a day in which this Court was much more likely to infer new causes of action from the Constitution or from statutes. The Court in its recent cases, most recently Malesko, has said that it's sworn off that habit, and it's refused to recognize any new Bivens action in 25 years since those cases were decided. Secondly, the Respondent here has ample remedies and avenues that he could seek. If he believes that there has been unauthorized trespass he can seek damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 49992 # TRUE # MR. GARRE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Two things, Justice Souter. First the argument was not raised below; we don't think it's properly before the Court. Second, the question under qualified immunity, and this Court made this clear in the Wyatt case and again in the Knight case, it doesn't look to the particular offense. It looks to the nature of the responsibility that the Government officials are performing. And here the nature of the responsibilities are enforcing grazing permits, enforcing access to public lands, activities that BLM officials have discretion and have had discretion for more than a century to enforce. And we think that falls squarely within the rubric of qualified immunity.

First, the large portion of the courts of appeals that have addressed this have concluded that qualified immunity principles do extend to RICO. And second, again, the focus of the inquiry is on the nature of the responsibilities. It's not on the particular offense alleged. It's not on whether there's a violation of that offense. It's the nature of the responsibilities, and here these responsibilities, enforcing permits enforcing access and use of public land, and protecting against abuse of those lands, are things that BLM officials and other government officers have exercised their discretion to do for more than

It's important to recognize the overarching context of how the Federal Government manages the public lands. There are   there are numerous reciprocal arrangements that could be affected by this. Any time a landowner refuses to enter into a reciprocal arrangement, he can then turn around in any government action that is taken against that landowner, all he has to do is add on an element of wrongful subjective intent, and he can bring a constitutional tort claim, or even a RICO claim like the respondent here, and subject officers to the threat of personal liability. And we think that this would have a significant skewing effect on legitimate government decision making. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

If the Court recognizes what I take it has not happened in the past, that there is an action for private people to bring against the government, Bivens, under the Fifth Amendment, all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations, the coal pillars in Holmes case, everything south of that will be suddenly in Federal court as people claim that what's going on with this regulation is there are individuals in the government who have gone too far, and they are just trying to get my property and the use of it, without paying a fair price. Now by the way, sometimes people in government do go too far, so many of those claims might have some justification. But suddenly I see the possibility of this kind of action becoming a major roadblock, an obstacle sometimes used unjustifiably, and not necessarily, not necessary, this kind of thing, to impose a roadblock to totally legitimate government regulatory action.

Moore when the remedy in that case for a prosecution that was brought to retaliate against someone for the exercise of her First Amendment right was a Bivens action against the postal inspectors who made this all up. Now the Court there addressed the possibility that this would unleash a flood of lawsuits, and it said that over the past quarter century, there had been only 12 Bivens or 1983 actions against this kind of retaliation. I suppose that is because not that many postal inspectors or BLM guys think they can get away with deliberately retaliating against people for exercising their rights.

So I don't think   I don't think you can make the argument that it would have had no effect on the improper behavior.
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 50088 # TRUE # MR. TRIBE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think the most important point that I'm trying to make, Justice Souter and Mr. Chief Justice, that when someone says, I do not want to give you my property, you have to take it from me and give me just compensation, the position of the Government here is that there is no constitutional limit on the kind of retaliation they can engage in.
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 50089 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, if the position of the Government were more fairly represented they would say, we don't want everyone to be able to claim that everything we're doing under color of law is retaliation, because then we'll hear that against IRS agents, we'll hear it against OSHA agents. So long as you   and their position is you have a remedy for everything you're complaining about, and you invoked some of them and you lost, you didn't invoke others and so you didn't prevail. But don't create a whole new remedy just because you're dissatisfied with having to pursue each one individually.
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 50090 # TRUE # MR. TRIBE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Bivens as a constitutional tort is not a new remedy. The question really is whether there is any conceivable basis when they trash his lodge, when they do all of the other things, for treating this differently from another kind of constitutional violation. I mean, they argue that it's very important, even though we could have lots of people bringing unjustified suits, to have a Bivens remedy for retaliation against free speech. The reason that they give is that free speech is easily chilled. But with property rights the Just Compensation Clause is kind of its own antifreeze.
argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 50091 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. The reason would be probably that the, if you can make a comparison. The number of Government actions that affect criminal charges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of governmental actions that affect people's property. Virtually, I mean the number of Government actions affecting how people use their property, it's the whole series of law books. It fills the room. And suddenly to open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is what's frightening me, which is what I said already. So you don't have to answer.

Some of the   Hartman is the First Amendment, and it's the Bivens case.

It's not that they are not entitled to a reciprocal easement. That might have been a problem under Nollan and Dolan to figure out whether there was enough connection, but I think there would have been enough. The problem was that they were using the right-of-way, which was long gone, as an excuse to get an invaluable piece of property that they had no right to get. They were then trying to   they were basically saying, and they made it explicit, give us this easement for nothing or we'll bury you.

There are overzealous government agents. There always have been and I am sure that, assuming all of the misbehavior described here is correct, I'm sure it is not the first time this has happened. Government agents sometimes get overzealous. But why should there be this extraordinary remedy when the overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire to get a piece of land, whereas if they had just picked on this guy because they didn't like the way he combed his hair or for any other reason and had done the same things you wouldn't have your Bivens action, right?

That's different from a freestanding cause of action. And I share Justice Scalia's concern. It seems to me in thinking about this case there is   there could be something very wrong here, going after a person because of what he's done. Suppose the Government wants somebody to be a witness in a trial and he won't do it, and they go around hurting his business, they go around invading his property and so forth. That to me is outrageous and you might have an argument that there should be a Bivens cause of action for that. And Justice Scalia's question   I had the same question   is why do we think it to the property? The essence here, the essence of what's going on, is that they're being vindictive against this person. Now again, the cases you're citing, include Hartman, which is a free speech case which is different, really don't support you. I think this is an extension of Bivens.

argument in Case 06-219, Wilkie versus Robinson # 06-219 # 50151 # TRUE # MR. TRIBE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # He was not given an answer. So what can one say? The district court decided   lest you assume that because he wasn't given an answer he doesn't have a case, the district court said, as hard as it is to prove these things, he has substantial evidence that they were picking on him solely to get the property, not because they didn't like him, not for some other reason; they were trying to get property for which they were unwilling to pay. It's doubtful that they could have taken it by eminent domain because the laws limiting the ability of the BLM require proving necessity and there is nothing in the record suggesting that they needed this easement. There is plenty in the record suggesting that he couldn't access his own property as long as the roadway wasn't maintained in a passable condition, and one of the ways they retaliated against him was to refuse to maintain the roadway. The record is also clear that his business suffered greatly. So that if the result is that someone who is trying to insist that if you want my property, you have to take it by eminent domain and give me just compensation, can't get help in those other ways, this is crucial. What would have happened in Kaiser Aetna, if when the Government said we think we have an easement to the Laguna pond, instead of going to court, which they did and they lost, if they had said well we are going to ram our motor boats or invite people to ram their motor boats into your sailboat? We are going to ruin your business in the Kuapa pond until you give the public an easement. Only a Bivens cause of action which the Court has recognized in other areas, in other constitutional claims   due process, free speech, Eighth Amendment   only a Bivens cause of action is directly responsive to that.

The next point I wanted to make, Justice Kennedy, is we agreed this would be a dramatic new extension of Bivens, and we agree with Justice Breyer, the problems or types of litigations that this new constitutional tort would create are really just   the   capable of the imagination.

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49585 # FALSE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Flast against Cohen, this Court recognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer could satisfy the requirements of Article III in challenging a congressional exercise of its spending and taxing authority. This court in doing so rejected the suggestion of Justice Douglas that it allow all taxpayers to sue in all manner of claims, as well as the slightly more modest suggestion of Justices Stewart and Fortas that the Court allow taxpayer standing for all establishment clause challenges. This Court's subsequent cases such as Valley Forge have made clear just how narrow the rule of Flast is. In order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements of Article III, the taxpayer must challenge a congressional exercise of the taxing and spending authority, and assert that the act of spending itself is what gives rise to the establishment clause violation. The court of appeals in the decision below substantially expanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so, the court adopted a doctrine that I think can fairly be only understood as an exception to, not an application of normal principles of Article III standing. The court did so on the rationale that there is much that the executive branch can do to violate the establishment cause, but there is much that all three branches of Government could conceivably do to violate the establishment clause, and that has never been thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer standing to all Government action, nor has it been thought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III.

I don't think it's just a matter of this executive order that's challenged in this case and Congress could have enacted that into statute.

And what I would say is if you have a challenge where the problem is that it's the very act of money going to the third party conference organizers that's the problem, then it really is a spending case, and I think the taxpayer standing would logically lie. But if it's really, what the concern here is the primary conduct of what was done at the conferences, and not the fact that there's spending on the conferences at all, then I think it's more   it is a case there would not be taxpayer standing.

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49676 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think   as a matter of first course, the Court tries. And here   if I could put the precedents on the map, though, I do think they make a modicum of sense in the following way. You start with Flast. Flast says that you can bring a challenge to a congressional spending statute. Okay, fair enough. Valley Forge comes along and says that you, that you don't have taxpayer standing to challenge an executive branch action. Now that raises a very obvious  
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49677 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # The difference was that it was because it was under the property clause, and made a distinction between property and money.

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49679 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # We are talking about money, not property?
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49680 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But Justice Ginsburg, in fairness, the Court could not have been more clear in Valley Forge that there were two reasons that there weren't taxpayer standing there. One was there was a challenge to Executive Branch action. The second was that it was the property clause rather than the spending clause. Now, you could sort of take the view that the third of the cases, Kendrick, overrules the first aspect of the decision in Valley Forge. Now I think that's wrong. I think the way to understand Kendrick is as follows: You have a decision that says you can   you can challenge congressional spending, not Executive Branch action. That naturally poses the question what about an as-applied challenge to a spending statute? Surely, I mean, because spending is something only the Congress does, and disbursement is a ministerial act that only the Executive does, what do you do when there's an intervening ministerial act of disbursement? Does that mean that it's still an as-applied challenge to the spending statute? Or does  
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49681 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Was it just  
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49682 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That mean that it's Executive Branch action?
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49683 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Was it just a ministerial act or did the Executive have discretion involved, about who would receive the grant?
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49684 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Ginsburg, two things. One, in Bowen, there was   there is certainly always a degree of discretion. But it is worth noting that in Bowen as in Flast, the statute itself on its face made clear that money was to go to outside entities that were religious. In Bowen it did so in express terms by four times referring to religious organizations. In Flast it did so by saying money was going to go, or in-kind aid, rather, was to going to go to private schools. And that was at a time when this Court roughly contemporaneously, in Lemon v Kurtzman that 93 percent of the private schools were religious. The both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint, that money is being spent by Congress on religious entities, was not within the discretion of the Executive Branch. And again, the way I would understand Kendrick is simply reconciling Valley Forge and Flast and Cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to Executive Branch action, which would have overruled Valley Forge, but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can bring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute.
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49685 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But you can reconcile Valley Forge simply by saying when it's money from the Federal Treasury, whether it is a general appropriation or a specific appropriation, it is money from the Treasury, and that's what Flast is about. Because whether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive program, which you have said can violate the establishment clause as well as a congressional program. So why isn't that the line to draw based on Flast, that it's money from the Treasury that makes the difference?
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49686 # TRUE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Ginsburg, it is certainly not the line I would draw from reading these cases side by side and together.
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49687 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Or to, or to put it another way, to put Justice Ginsburg's point another way, every Executive action that involves the expenditure of congressionally authorized funds is an as-applied challenge to an expenditure statute. Because the only way the statute is applied is through executive action. And whenever the executive spends the funds improperly, you have an as-applied challenge to the congressional statute authorizing the funds, whether it's a general statute or a   or a single shot statute.

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49695 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So what's wrong with just saying that Flast stands for the proposition that when the Government spends money in violation of the establishment clause, a taxpayer   after all, the money comes from the taxpayer   can bring a lawsuit? And the reason that they do that is because the establishment clause is an important joint part of the religion clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a challenge. And sometimes it's that simple principle, and when we depart from that principle, say by giving property away instead of giving money away, you don't have the standing. So we have a pretty clear, simple rule. That rule applies whether it's Congress or the President acting under congressional authority, et cetera, which I think is close to what the other side

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49703 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That's what I was saying.

He said bestowal of Government largesse outside the Government. The second point I would make is I still don't understand where in just being upset you satisfy the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, and even though Flast is probably the outer limit of what's an Article III injury under normal principles, there is at least what Judge Leventhal in Public Citizen against Simon called conceptual directness between the injury to the taxpayer and the injury that comes when tax money is spent outside the Government to a religious entity. He differentiated that from what happens when you have general Executive Branch activity that's unlawful, where he said there's no similar arrow between the action and taxpayers as a class. It's a classic injury that's inflicted on everybody. It's a generalized grievance, which has never been said to satisfy Article III.

And we think there's no basis for drawing the arbitrary lines that the Government suggests. And maybe I can follow up on some of the points that my colleague made and that the Court made during the questioning. First of all, with respect to the argument that the money has to go outside the Government. There's certainly nothing in this Court's cases that say that and the lower courts and this Court at least in part have found taxpayer standing to challenge the salaries paid to chaplains that are employed by the Government, and of course those would be

The President needs protection at all times no matter where he goes. The President may be doing something that violates the establishment clause, but protection is the job, and it doesn't make any difference where the President is. And so your answer to the question, well, suppose he had a special protector who just took care of his religious activities? I would still say that it's, protection is the thing.

One is, is there a discrete and identifiable expenditure that only arises with respect to religious activities. The second question is, does that particular expenditure, is that particular expenditure an incidental one? Flast said incidental expenditures don't give rise to standing.

But we also agree that there are some limits that   the Court has said that every single dollar that's expended for a bad purpose doesn't give rise to a challenge. My example, if there's a prayer breakfast and all   the only money that's spent is on the bagels, we don't believe the bagels are the basis for a taxpayer challenge to the prayer breakfast.
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49782 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So in fact, you have   just help me with one point here. I mean, I see that deciding what's incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult. I guess many of these cases would end up being decided on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or maybe sometimes there is. But I'd started thinking of the question of standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when the Government spends money in favor of one religion and not another. After all, they led to the 30 Years War. We see that in other places in the world today. People feel strongly. And if, in fact, they have that terribly strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in the courts at all, and the Government can do what it wants without challenge. So in Flast, they carved out an exception, and the exception was where the taxing and spending clauses were involved, because Madison and others said this is aimed at "Government shall not tax and spend". So that was my theory. And all we're saying is where there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't incidental, there's standing. Now we're worried about the merits. Simple and clear. To which the response was, which has me a little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice Stewart's position, or roughly speaking. But the Court rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later cases, they reject it too. And therefore, whatever you might think of it, it isn't the law. And I'm not free to think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance with what the cases say. So what is your response? I'd like you to focus on that.

And what he said here is he was just explaining his reason why he believed that Flast was distinguishable from Frothingham, and notes specifically that taxpayers have a clear stake because of the threepence comment. Justice Fortas did say, did have a broader theory, although he   in addition, that the court did not adopt   but he also said, recognizing very similar language to Justice Stewart, what the Court's opinion held. So I think Justice Stewart's opinion is useful because he doesn't talk about Congress, he talks about expenditures.

The focus of the claim isn't that bagels were served. The focus of the claim is there was prayer and that it was a religious meeting. If there was   just to think of what such a claim might be. And so the expenditure that   that's been identified is the bagels, it really is pretty tangential compared to the focus of what someone's complaining about. And so we think that's a rational test for doing what Justice Kennedy was talking about.

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49847 # TRUE # MR. PINCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor, we do, because in Valley Forge, first of all, as Justice Ginsburg said, the Court relied on the fact that it was a property clause claim. There is a passage in Valley Forge that refers to executive action, but the Court in Kendrick when it talked about Valley Forge said, in characterizing that case, said executive action pursuant to the property clause. And we think those things are tied together and there's a reason why. In the appropriations context, there always is congressional action with respect to the very money that's at issue because there has to be a congressional appropriation. That's not true in the property context. Congress doesn't have to say, pass a statute to say, here are the 58 property sites that we want the executive to get rid of.

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49849 # TRUE # MR. PINCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think that the core of what was the concern was   was the taking of the money and the using it for religious purposes. And I think what the

argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49853 # TRUE # MR. PINCUS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think that the Court decided that it made a difference, and I think in terms of cabining, in terms of the worry that perhaps Flast is going to be overbroad and the need to have Congress involved, which I think is key   there was no congressional involvement at all in designating those properties and there is in the appropriations context, and I think that's a key difference. But I think what's important here, and the Court's colloquy in the first part of the argument showed me this   but the Government's position, the idea that it's only grants to third parties   - the Government could hire a corps of chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the populace at large and that couldn't be challenged, because all it is is executive pay; and the Idea that there's some difference between a Bowen v. Kendrick situation, where the executive had tremendous discretion in terms of where it was going to give the money, and the situation here, which is the exercise of Precisely the same executive discretion, makes no sense. The injury is the same. The conduct that's   that's the core of the violation is the same. It's an Executive Branch decision to use funds in a way that's impermissible under the establishment clause, and we've been drawing the lines that the Government has been trying to draw just makes no sense, and to leave out, to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge swaths of conduct that is really at the very core of what Madison was concerned about. So our submission is that that really makes no sense. There's no basis in history, for example, for the Government's claim that Executive Branch decisions are somehow different and insulated with respect to spending. It's the spending of the same threepence, and if history indicates anything it's that concerns about establishment were focused just as much on the King as on the Parliament in terms of the history that the framers understood. And for the idea that the executive would be given free rein to exercise discretion with respect to spending and there would be no concern about the types of injuries that gave rise to Flast we think is just not right. If the Court has no further questions, thank you.
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49854 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Pincus. General Clement, you have three minutes remaining.
argument in case 06-157, Hein versus Freedom From Religion Foundation # 06-157 # 49856 # FALSE # GENERAL CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, I think it's important to emphasize that if this Court recognizes that there is not taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there won't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured plaintiffs that can bring claims. Doremus and Schemp prove that point. But even more broadly, any time the establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced Are going to have standing to bring the suit. The second point to make clear is it's just not an accurate description of this Court's cases to say that the spending of appropriated funds by the executive is enough to give rise to taxpayer standing. The property distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run. Nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing. The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a threepence. But that was not found enough. Now, I think in trying to understand the Court's cases you really have to focus on this word "incidental." And I think that the colloquy in the second half of the argument shows that you can't look at incidental as being minimal. It doesn't mean that. It doesn't mean minimal. It doesn't mean incremental. It is trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of funds when   as to something where the expenditure of funds is central or vital to the establishment clause violation. In the context of money going to third party religious entities, nobody would say that the spending is incidental. It's the whole violation. In the context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems. The problem is the primary conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury. The funding that goes into that is incidental. I think that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases. It's important to emphasize what's at issue here. It's not a general challenge to the Faith-Based Office. It's not a challenge to the name of the office. It is a challenge to the particular offices and the assertion that the Executive Branch officials at the conferences spent too much time talking about faith-based groups and not enough talking about community-based groups. If that isn't intrusive on the Executive Branch, I don't know what is. The last point I would leave you with is that if something has to go in this area, if you have to choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an easy choice. You don't abandon the basic requirements of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the political branches of Government. I think the Seventh Circuit, with all due respect, lost sight of that. Its decision should be reversed. Thank you.

WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is properly before this Court, which should reverse under the plain language and purpose of the Organic Act of Guam. As to jurisdiction, at the time Congress amended the Organic Act to replace the certiorari jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit with direct review in this Court, the Ninth Circuit had already granted the writ of certiorari that had been timely filed and the case had been briefed, argued and submitted. The amendment said nothing about its application to pending appeals, and someone had to decide whether and how it applied to this case. The Ninth Circuit was the proper body to do that, at least in the first instance, and until it did, this case was before that Court within the meaning of Gibbs versus Wynn.

But in any event, we know from the Ninth Circuit that it did not consider it otherwise, because if the Court will refer to I believe it's page 50a or 51a of the joint appendix, after the Court decided Santos, it sua sponte issued an order in this case   it is on page 51a   resubmitting this case effective February 1 to the Ninth Circuit's active consideration. And shortly thereafter, it filed the order in this case from that   in our view, triggered the 2101(c) 90-day period.

WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I wouldn't have the most, the strongest argument that I have in this case. I think   now, the Court's cases are not clear here but it does seem to me that in the instance as here, where it isn't just that a party has made some application or filed a cert petition with a court, but the court has actually reached out and asserted jurisdiction, surely anything other than an amendment withdrawing   that an active withdrawing   withdrawing jurisdiction that requires anything other than merely a ministerial act, where there can be no possible confusion about what Congress intended to do, certainly anything short of that, it lies with the Court to ascertain it. And here

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49390 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I actually would not embrace that test.

And so I'm not sure that I would even embrace a ministerial test concept in the context in which a case is properly pending in front of a court which has affirmatively asserted jurisdiction over it.

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49392 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. Yes, Your Honor. And I think you should   well, I suppose you could start anywhere. But let's, maybe it would be as well to start on 49a of the joint appendix. In December 15   remember, the Guam Organic Act was amended I believe October 30, 19   or 2004, and it was silent as to its effect on cases that had already been filed and were pending in the Ninth Circuit. Sua sponte, the Court   well, actually it was not sua sponte. Almost two months after Congress enacted the Organic Act, the respondent in this case, Governor Camacho filed a motion on December 8 with the Court renewing a previous motion for the Court to expedite its resolution in this case. And Governor Camacho's affidavit in support of that motion is included in the joint appendix. In response to the motion, not telling the Court hey, by the way, it's been nice doing business with you but we have no further truck with your court because Congress passed the statute and you are ipso facto by operation of law no longer in business, the Ninth Circuit issued the order on page 49a that says no opinion in this case can issue until the case of Santos is decided clarifying our continuing certiorari jurisdiction over decisions from the Guam Supreme Court. Then turn to page 50a of the joint appendix. A week later, on December 22, the Court sua sponte issues an order withdrawing and deferring a ruling in this case pending the decision in Santos. Santos is then decided in January. And on February 1, the Court issues an order in this pending case saying okay, it's resubmitted to the panel. And shortly thereafter, the panel issued the order dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction, and from that date we filed a timely petition for certiorari. Now the contention of the respondent in this case that the attorney general should immediately upon enactment of the Organic Act amendment have also filed a petition with this Court would do one of two things. It either would have put this Court in the position of determining the effect of the amendment at the very same time that the Ninth Circuit was doing so, which is a state of affairs that this Court has repeatedly rejected, most notably in Andrews versus Virginia Railway, or it would have amounted to nothing more than what this Court has called, quote, "the filing of a redundant slip of paper."

And in that instance, the Organic Act was in effect. He filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court. There were two cases that were pending in the Ninth Circuit and over which the Ninth Circuit had granted the writ, this case and Santos. In Santos, but not in this case, the Court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs with respect to the Court's continued jurisdiction, and the attorney general did so in this case, and it's discussed in our reply brief.

This Court has said uniformly outside the special context of three-judge courts that it will not require the mere filing of a redundant piece of paper, to quote the Colville Indian Reservation case, and it has declined to extend this well, why don't you just file a notice of appeal.

But that is actually what this Court was referring to in the Colville Indian Reservation case and other cases in calling it redundant in the sense that it was identical or effectively identical to a piece of paper that had invoked the jurisdiction of another court at the same time. In the three-judge court context, Justice Ginsburg, although this Court's jurisdiction to hear direct appeals in three-judge courts has been greatly reduced since the 1950s and sixties and early seventies, there are certain instances that this Court has realized where it is unclear whether an appeal lies to a regional court of appeals or to this Court and it is unavoidable there that you would file a notice of appeal in both instances; but this is not a situation in which there was any uncertainty about where the petition for a writ of certiorari from the Guam Supreme Court's decision had to be filed. The Organic Act said the Ninth Circuit had certiorari jurisdiction. The Ninth Circuit granted the petition in this case and had assumed authority over it, and so

The Guam Supreme Court considered this as a court of first instance that original petition was filed in the Guam Supreme Court. And the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals at the time that the attorney general filed the petition for a writ of certiorari was the only place the attorney general of Guam could go to get review of this construction by a territorial court sitting as a trial court in the first instance of an act of Congress.

This is kind of an intramural dispute between two Guamanian officials about what Guam's position should be with respect to the Organic Act and I'm wondering why that's a justiciable controversy under Article III. The cases you cited in your petition all involved on its   only facially intra   interbranch disputes within the Federal Government; but the agencies in those cases always   were representing a real party in interest. United States versus ICC, the ICC was actually the railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled. Why shouldn't we just let Guam figure out its position on its own and then when a private party with standing challenges something then we'll have a case or controversy.

But here's the situation here, and this is why I think it's an a fortiori case. The attorney general and the governor of Guam are each separately elected. They each have non-discretionary obligations under Guam law in addition to their obligation to interpret and enforce the Constitution and laws of the United States. The attorney general cannot be removed by, by the governor, by Guam law, unlike the case in many of these Federal executive branch intramural disputes; and she is required by Guam law in any instance in which the governor and the legislature attempt to borrow money subject to the full faith and credit of the territory to certify that such borrowing is lawful. And in this instance, therefore, she is, as the unremovable elected chief law enforcement of the territory, she is required both to properly apply the Federal law that, the Organic Act that constitutes Guam's constitution and Guam territorial law which requires her affirmatively to certify the legality of the proposed buy-in.

Now, the answer to that question will turn in the first instance   and she's not going to be reelected before then. She can't be removed by the governor before then. Her position is that if she ascertains that in the form in which it's enacted that proposed borrowing implicates, you know, constitutes debt within the meaning of section 11, she will not sign that legislation. And that, it seems to me, during the campaign   of course, none of this is in the record   her position was that she would continue to pursue this litigation in the Supreme Court, which is why she's here.

The simple answer is that   is the following. There are   looking first at the States, there are States that use the term "the valuation." There are States that use "the assessed valuation," "aggregate assessed valuation," and there are a few States that use "tax valuation." It is uniformly the case in the States and elsewhere that the word "assessed" in this context is understood to refer to the valuation against which the property tax is based, whether that happens to be a place where it is full value or a fractional value; but it is also the case that at the time that the Guam Supreme   that the Guam Organic Act was enacted fractional valuation was a commonplace for purposes of assessing property tax.

And in the territories the Congress has used essentially two formulations: In the Springer Act it was "assessed value of taxable property." In Alaska, it was "aggregate taxable value." In Guam it's "aggregate tax valuation." In Hawaii, it was "assessed value;" in the Northern Marianas, "aggregate assessed valuation." The Philippines, which you mentioned, is a particularly instructive example because in 1902 and 1905 it was "assessed valuation," but then in 1916 and 1922, it was altered to be "aggregate tax valuation." And then the Virgin   Puerto Rico is "aggregate tax valuation" and the virgin Islands, which we've discussed, is "aggregate assessed valuation." Now, the legislative histories of these provisions, including the Guam provision, are lengthy, obscure and frankly have been very difficult to obtain because in many instances the hearings are unreported. And we have been receiving the legislative history, particularly the unpublished legislative histories, of these provisions up to and including Saturday because in the 11 days over the Christmas holiday in which we did our reply brief we simply could not get hearing, transcripts of hearings that were conducted in 1949 in that Agana, Guam.

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49442 # TRUE # MR.

And that's true not only as a matter of plain language, but for three other reasons. First of all, as I indicated, it puts Guam in harmony with the regime that has existed in every other U.S. territory in which the value of property against which the debt limitation rate is assessed is the same as the value of property against which the tax rate is assessed. And secondly, or thirdly, that fully accords with the statutory and legislative history both with respect to the territories and the states that reflects that it has always been understood that tax valuation and assessed valuation are equivalent in this context, and understanding that furthers Congress's consistent goal of restraining borrowing by territories. And finally, interpreting tax to mean full renders the word tax all but meaningless. I grant you, Justice Kennedy, that it is possible to come up with a meaning. It is not a meaning that the Guam Supreme Court adopted but it is a possible meaning; but the Guam Supreme Court interprets   actually said in its opinion, tax has to mean something. It interpreted tax not to modify valuation, the word that follows it, but to modify the word "property," and to read it as taxable property, which is with all respect plainly wrong.

With respect to Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico happens to be a situation which so far as we have been able to ascertain, the law actually requires that for purposes of determining valuation for application of the tax rate, the assessed rate is required to be the actual value, as is the case in the Virgin Islands. So that distinction wouldn't exist. On the other hand, in the Philippines, it is clear from 1902 on that a system of fractional valuation was in place. Now, getting   figuring out what actually happened in the Philippines way back when, when it was a territory of the United States, has been challenging and its may very well be that there is information; but simply, simply obtaining for example, the   the three unpublished hearings with respect to the Virgin Islands legislation in 1949 has been actually surprisingly   surprisingly challenging.

There are three principal reasons supporting both of these positions.

In the Donovan Ricky Richland case, the Court made clear you would not vacate it when it was simply a failure to obey the rules. The Court refused to vacate and remand in that case, as we point out in our brief. This is a case such as Justice Scalia was positing where there is an actual issue of, colorable question of jurisdiction. The proper course would to be to challenge, and here Petitioner did not even try to litigate the question, did not file any brief after Santos came down, never tried to distinguish this case from Santos. He merely waited and did not timely pursue the writ of the Guam Supreme Court, the judgment that was final at that point in time.

BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The timely petition to the Ninth Circuit and the grant of certiorari would have suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court judgment. Once Congress in its authority to demarcate the jurisdictions of the lower Federal courts had passed that the statute, it was no   for no court to question that, was divested jurisdiction at that time. The Guam Supreme Court judgment was again final and it had 90 days to petition. I should say there are other cases. Eisenberg makes clear that time was not suspended when the court below does not have jurisdiction. The Market Street Railways case makes clear when as a matter of law the lower court no longer can act on the case, the time is no longer suspended. And the Jesse Oil case makes clear that the party can not rely on a false exercise of jurisdiction by the lower court.

And that is the authority to determine its own jurisdiction. I presume that jurisdiction is determined on a case by case basis when a case has already been accepted by the Court, and as Justice Ginsburg said is sub judice. So if there was, if there was jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction in Santos, I don't see why there wasn't likewise jurisdiction to determine it here.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49475 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There was jurisdiction, Your Honor. Our position is the same in both of those cases.

All the other side is saying is that up to that point, the court was determining its own jurisdiction. And therefore it is only when it determined that its jurisdiction no longer existed, that the filing period began to run. So it seems to me that the crucial question is if it could determine its own jurisdiction in Santos which you concede, why can't it determine its own jurisdiction here?

If it came to this Court, and the Court found there was jurisdiction, so be it. We think it would have been a wrong ruling. And if it came to this Court and this Court reversed, that is the scenario we discussed, where in the three-judge district court when that turns out, the court says we don't have jurisdiction, you needed to come up through the other route, we will dismiss, vacate and send back and come up. Now I have to urge on the Court there's a purpose for that. In those cases the party is actively believing and pursuing the view that jurisdiction exists. In this case that was not the scenario.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49499 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But those cases really are not on point. Because there was a vast confusion in the days when there was a three-judge court, do I file a jurisdictional statement, do I file a cert petition? Sometimes this Court said we'll treat the jurisdictional statement as a cert petition. But those existed from the beginning. Here there's a case lodged in the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals had every basis of jurisdiction. This was no big shakes about it. It wasn't, did they file the right paper? And then Congress does something. And the Court would follow suit. It just seems to me very strange to say the court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction, but if it decides it doesn't, then the date of that order is not the critical date, but you go back to the date that Congress passed the law.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49500 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I think that this Court addressed this scenario, and one of two things could have happened. As you pointed out during Petitioner's argument, it would have been an easy thing to file a protective cert position. This Court is well familiar, has recognized the appropriate of protective filings   certainly in the Federal habeas situation where there are mixed petitions and we go back in thought, protective filing within the 90-day period would have been appropriate. And I urge, particularly because Petitioner filed a brief within that period in the Santos case, recognizing that Brunner required that there was a divestiture of Ninth Circuit jurisdiction as of the day of the statute enactment. Even if there had not been that protective filing, if Petitioner had a colorable jurisdiction argument and litigated it, this Court has made clear that once that has been determined adversely, there can be a vacation and remand back to the Guam Supreme Court so that judgment can be brought up. I would like to turn to the merits if I could, Your Honor. We believe that the well-reasoned opinion of the Guam Supreme Court should be affirmed for three reasons. First, the interpretation takes full account of the text of the statute. As Justice Kennedy was mentioning before, the purpose of this is to have a debt limitation that is based on the property in Guam and the tax valuation of that property in Guam. The tax valuation is the valuation of the property that is subject to tax. This is not an original interpretation of this provision. In the Superior Court opinion from 1989 that we attached to our brief in opposition, the Guam Supreme Court came to the same conclusion and interpretation of this language. We think it is an eminently reasonable and correct interpretation, particularly in light of the absence of the word as set.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49501 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But don't you know that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this statute? I mean your position would be exactly the same if it just said 10 percent of the value of the property in Guam.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49502 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor. That would include the tax-exempt property. That would be a much larger number.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49503 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That's where I'm having trouble on your side. I can't get very far with a history of other places. Apparently I can't get there. Tax doesn't seem to help me very much. So I thought, well, one thing is clear. What they're trying to do here is they take out of the box, if you look at it, take all of the list of property that they don't tax. I guess a school, maybe some tax exempt business or something.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49504 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now their reason for doing that must be that those people who they've exempted entirely by statute are not going to be much help in paying Guam. Well, if that's true, isn't precisely the same thing true of the two-thirds of the property that they don't take into account when they set their taxes?

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49507 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because that property in Guam is still securing this debt to a certain degree. It is property that must be valued for tax purposes.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49508 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. It doesn't secure it one bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take it into account when you set your taxes. Just as is true of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind. Now Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its statute, but so could it change its statute in respect to a school, a university, or whatever the other things are that are off those tax rolls. You know that, you know, your answer was circular. That assumes that the whole property is, but it isn't.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49509 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, as a matter of textual interpretation as to the tax valuation of property in Guam, you look at the property in Guam and then you have to take the tax valuation. You're taking the property that is subject to tax. We believe that this is the intent of Congress also for two reasons, Justice Breyer, that addressed your issues before about one suggestion that Guam could change this. The purpose of Congress here was to set a meaningful debt limit. That is what real value appraisal value does. It is an economic determination of currency fact.
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49510 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, why why does it do any more than the 35 percent value? That sets a definite limit.

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49516 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, whether it was their intent or not, is it not the case that Guam could say all property will be valued at 150 percent of its fair market value and we will then impose a 1 percent real estate tax instead of the 2 percent, or instead of the 1.5 percent we had before?
argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49517 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, they certainly could do that as a matter of fact. We don't believe that should alter the debt limitation Congress enacted, and that's precisely why we believe that the Guam Supreme Court opinion gives a meaningful interpretation of the purpose of Congress and gives a real debt limitation that exactly should be affirmed as exactly the purpose that Congress intended. And that's why the assessed value can be so easily manipulated, and is not a reasonable interpretation. I also would like to address Justice Breyer's question about the

That is well established under this Court.

And we are not suggesting that the Court affirm an erroneous interpretation at all. This is a more than reasonable interpretation of a theory, well reasoned opinion by the Guam Supreme Court. The Guam Supreme Court has support, it's 17-year old superior court opinion that had reached the same conclusion. That was the only law out there that Guamanians had looked to for the interpretation of those provisions of the Organic Act. It predated the 1993 appraisal. And it took that opinion and did not simply adopt it, but went through and did a very detailed analysis of the test of the statute of the Organic Act, the fact that it did not include the word assessed, which was used 10 months later by Congress in the Virgin Islands.

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49561 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Absolutely, Your Honor. Because of Petitioner's delay for more than a year and a half in a court that did not have jurisdiction, these bonds still have not been able to issue. And Petitioner responded no. As a practical matter, the bond market will not support issuance of these bonds until attempts to undermine their validity have been brought to an end. And so the Guam government has been doing different means of financing in a positive manner. The economy of Guam has returned because of many of the devastating world events have taken, have passed in time, and the economy is recovering. The U.S. military is returning with a very large presence there. But they are still, my understanding, approximately two years behind in getting back tax returns.

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49569 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is exactly the kind of policy decision that the local governing authority makes about taxes. Actually the Petitioner has a footnote explaining the origin of fractional tax valuation. Indeed, it seems to be consistent with some of the history also that we've seen that there would be informal adjustments of valuations to take into account perhaps poverty, or to take into account less meritorious justifications. And the   because of the perception or, I believe petitioner calls it the political psychology perhaps, of having such a high rate, that is a policy decision that different taxing authorities make. It should not mean that Guam surrenders two-thirds of its debt limitation. Congress did not use the word assessed and it's a very difficult argument to adopt that by failing to use assessed, they limited it to an assessed value that surrendered two-thirds of the Guam territorial debt limitation contrary to all

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49571 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor, and in the Santa Fe case versus Friday, with all due respect, Petitioner is incorrect that that addressed territorial laws. That was a provision in the New Mexico Organic Act that fed up the jurisdiction of district courts that Congress created in New Mexico. There was a provision in that Organic Act provision of New Mexico that said the jurisdiction of those courts was as limited as law. That passage was interepreted in this Court in Friday looking at another Federal statute and some territorial laws. I would direct the Court to the briefs in the case, that opinion itself was quite brief, and when you look at the explications of the party, it simply reinforces that the Court there was construing an organic act, a Federal statue, and local territorial statutes, and there directly said that they should defer to the local understanding of the courts unless it is clearly wrong. So we urge that that, too, should be

argument in case 06-116, Limtiaco versus Camacho # 06-116 # 49578 # FALSE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I want to direct the Court   in response to two questions that were asked of Ms. Brinkmann, I want to direct the court to two pages of the Guam Supreme Court's opinion, and I'm going to summarize them for you now, but for purposes of what's the difference between in terms of bond holders, the fact that certain property isn't taxed at all and certain property is only taxed at 35 percent, what's important to note here, and that is reflected at page 26a of the petition appendix, the tax roll on Guam includes a valuation of all nontaxable property. The Guam Supreme Court then has to go back and say, well, of this approximately 183 million is exempt. So in Guam, the tax assessor and the Guam courts are treating property that is wholly exempt from taxation the same way that it treats the two-thirds of fair market value that is exempt from application of the tax rate. Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's questions about why are we focusing   why wouldn't bond holders focus on assessed valuation rather than the rest and what difference does all of this make, page 18a of the joint appendix, which is footnote 8 of the Guam Supreme Court's opinion, which comes in the   the portion of the opinion where the court says, look, "tax" has to mean something; we think it means taxable property, not tax valuation. The Guam Supreme Court in its opinion in footnote 8, quoting from some language from a dissenting opinion in the Hawaii Supreme Court, says as follows, and I'm quoting from footnote 8: "It has been argued that the use of a percentage of assessed value as a measure of the State debt limit is without significance," now skipping the rest of the sentence. "The people that buy the bonds are interested in the ratio of your debt to your assessed value because, while all of the tax revenues of the State or the counties naturally are available for the payment of the debt, it's been customary for bond holders to look to the real property tax as their collateral." That is the authority on which the Guam Supreme Court relied and it applies to this case and it explain why the word "assessed" and the word "taxable" have been construed synonymously and interchangeably in the legislative history of these territorial statutes and why assessed value is understood to be usually fractional value for reasons of political psychology that Ms. Brinkmann addressed, but even where it's full value, it is only pursuant to a determination that for assessment purposes full value should be used.
