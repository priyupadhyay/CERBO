not be at the phone level and they re no not be at the frame level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler and\nand so the main thing is just being able\nwell i guess the two\num one that chuck is starting out with something that we don t have to start over that we don t have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other of\nright\nand being able to at least get enough information out on where we condition the location of on information that s in the kind of file that you put up there\nand that would that would do it\ni mean for me\nyeah\ni think that there are quick and dirty\nand then there are long term big infrastructure\nand so we want to try to pick something that us do a little bit of both\nin the between\nright\nand especially that the representation t have to be thrown away\num\nright\neven if your change\nand so it to me that\ni mean i have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want\nbut if we use the atlas external file representation um it like it s rich enough that you could do quick just as i said in\nyeah\nand then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve we can use the whole atlas inter infrastructure\ni mean that good to me\nwhich all that built in\ni i don t\nso\nif if you would l look at that and let us know what you think\nsure\ni mean i think we re sort of guinea\ni i want to get the prosody work done\nbut i don t want to waste time you know getting the\noh maybe\nyeah\num\nwell i t wait for the because anything you pick we be able to translate to another form\nwell\nma\n", "68": "well maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you you be dealing with\nbecause um you know might have one opinion but you might have another\nyeah\nso\nyeah definitely\ni think the more look at this the better\nespecially if there s e um you know if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right\noh hi\nhi jane\n", "69": "the right representation\nthen i you know i hope it won t\nwe don t actually need the whole full blown thing to be ready\ncan you\noh well\nso\num\nso maybe if you can look at it and sort of see what\nsure\nyeah\num\ni think we re we re we re actually just\nwe re about done\nyeah\nwrapping up\n", "70": "but\num\nyeah\nsorry it s a short meeting\nbut um\nwell i don t know\nis there anything else\nlike\ni mean that me a lot\nwell i think the other thing we might want to look at is to\nbut\ni mean th the reason i like is i m already familiar with it\nwe have here\nand so if we pick something else there s the learning curve problem\nbut i mean it is just something we at\nand so\nis there an is there an\nyeah\n", "71": "there s an for it\nand\nthere used to be a problem that they get too large\na bunch of\nand so basically the the t\nwell that s be a problem no matter what\nyou have the two limit on the size\nand we definitely hit that with broadcast news\nmaybe you could extend the to support like splitting up you know conceptually one file into smaller on disk\nso that you can essentially you know have arbitrarily long f\nyep\nmost of the can handle that\nso that\nyeah\nwe t do it at the level\nwe did it at the t tool level\nthat that most many of them can s you can specify several\nand they just be done sequentially\n", "72": "so\nso i guess\nyeah\nif if you and don can if you can show him the stuff and see\nsure\nso this would be like for the\ni mean if you do man or apropos you see a lot\ntrue\ni used the i think\ni at it at least briefly i think when we were doing s something\nwhat does the stand for anyway\ni have no idea\noh in there\ni t de i t develop it\nyou know it was i think it was\nso it s all part of the library\nit all the for it\nno were around way before\noh were they\nwere were around when w with um rap\n", "73": "right\nit s like the history of\nyou worked with\nlike\n", "74": "no\ni worked with\nyeah\ni don t remember what the is though\nno\nbut there are ni they re\nthe library a bunch of in it to handle\nyeah\nso it works pretty well\n", "75": "and that t really i guess as important as the the main i don t know what you call it the the main sort of word level\nneither do i\nprobably for\n", "76": "it s a file\nyeah\nthat s my guess\nhuh\n", "77": "well that s really useful\ni mean this is exactly the kind of thing that i to settle\num\nso\nyeah i been meaning to look at the atlas stuff again anyway\ngreat\nso just keep\nyeah\ni guess it s also sort of a political\ni mean if if you feel like that s a community that would be good to tie into anyway then it s like it s worth doing\nyeah i think it it w\nj i think there s\nand w as i said i what i did with this stuff i based it on theirs\nit s just they t actually come up with an external format yet\nso now that they have come up with a format it t it pretty reasonable to use it\n", "78": "but let me look at it again\n", "79": "great\nas i said that\nwe actually can start\nthere s one level there s one more level of indirection\nand i m just blanking on exactly how it works\ni look at it again\ni mean we can start with um i guess this input from s\nwhich you had printed out the input\nhe all of the\nyou know with the in the tag and stuff like that\nyeah i seen it\nso that would be i directly\nyep\num\neasy easy to map\nyeah\nand so then it would just be a matter of getting making sure to handle the that are you know not at the word level and um t to import the\nwhere are those coming from\nwell right now i g jane would would\n", "80": "yeah\nare you talking about the overlap a\nyeah\nany kind of annotation that like t already there\nyou know anything you can envision\nyeah\nso what i was was um so we can have unlimited of green\nand so put a a green ribbon on for an overlap code\nand since we w we\ni i think it s important to remain flexible regarding the time for now\nand so it s nice to have\nhowever you know you want to have it time time in the discourse\nso\num\nif we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap then you have a time marking\nit won t it be independent of the time\nhowever these e evolve shrink or whatever\nincrease\nor\nalso you could have different time for different\nand it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique you know anchored clear\nand it would just end up on a separate ribbon\nso the overlap is be easy with respect to that\nright\nyou look puzzled\ni i just i don t quite understand what these are\n", "81": "what the themselves\n", "82": "well th overlap\nor the\ni m not sure what that\nwell i mean is that\nwell we don t have to go into the\nit probably t matter\nwe don t have to go into the\nno i d\ni mean it t\ni mean that not for the topic of this meeting\nbut let me just\nno\nw the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon\nyou know\nand and and let s say that this is a time bin\nthere s a word here\nthis is the first word of an segment of any length\nwith any other word i segment of any length\nand um\nthen you can indicate that this here was perhaps a a\nor you can say that it was um a usurping of the turn\nor you can you know any any number of\nbut the fact is you have it time tagged in a way that s independent of the particular time bin that the word up in\nif it s a large unit or a small unit or\n", "83": "we sh change the of the\nright\nit s still unique and and with the format\nflexible all that\num\nit would be nice\num\neh this is sort of r regarding it s related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion\nbut when it comes to um you often find yourself in the situation where you have different of the same say word sequence\nyeah\n", "84": "yeah\nand sometimes the word even differ slightly because they were s at one place but not the other\nso once this data out there some people might start this for i don t know dialogue or um you know or what the heck\nyou know\nthere s a that people might annotate this for\nand the only thing that is really sort of common among all the the various of this data is the word sequence\nyep\nor approximately\nor the time\nor the times\nbut see if you d annotate dialogue you don t necessarily want to or you don t really want to be dealing with time\ni guess\nyou d it s much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence right\n", "85": "i mean most people t as sophisticated as as we are here with you know time and stuff\nso\nso the the the point is\nshould should we mention some on the people who are n\nright\nso\num\nthe p my point is that you re end up with word that are differently\nand you want some tool that is able to sort of merge these different back into a single version\n", "86": "um and we had this problem very massively at when we worked a while back on well on dialogue as well as you know\num what was it\n", "87": "well all the switchboard in it\nutterance\nyeah\nthere s automatic punctuation and stuff like that\nbecause we had one set of that were based on one version of the with a particular segmentation\nand then we had another version that was based on a different s slightly version of the with a different segmentation\nso we had these two different which were you know you could tell they were from the same source but they t identical\nso it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different\nyep\ni i don t see any way that file are help us with that\nno\nit s it s all a question of semantic\nno\nbut once you have a file format i can imagine writing not personally but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool um that between various\n", "88": "yeah\nand sort of like th you know you have this thing in where you have\n", "89": "or\nthere s the that actually to reconcile different two f based on the same original\nyeah\nis it\nyep\n", "90": "something like that\num but operating on these that are really what s behind this this annotation format\nyep\nso\nyou could definitely do that with the\nthere s actually a library you can use to do like that that so you have different\nso somewhere in the you would like to have like a merge or some some function that two two\nyeah i think it s be very hard\nany sort of structured anything when you try to merge is really really hard\nright\nbecause you ha i\nthe hard part t the file format\nthe hard part is what you mean by merge\nis\nexactly\nbut the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the is the the speaker ons and\nand that s very difficult\nso if you have a good\num\nbut this is exactly what i mean is that that the problem i\nyeah\nyou just have to know wha what to tie it to\nyeah\nexactly\nthe problem is saying what are the semantics\nand\nwhat do you mean by merge\nright right\nright\nso\nso so just to let you know what we where we it by doing by doing\nboth were based on\nso bo we have two of the same you know sprinkled with with different for\nand then you did\nand we did\nyeah\nexactly\nthat s just what i thought\nand that s how\nthat s just how i would have done it\nyeah\nbut you know it had lots of\nand would end up in the wrong order and so forth\n", "91": "so\nyep\num if you had a more\n", "92": "it it was a\nbecause it was basically reducing everything to to to textual alignment\na textual\num\nso\nbut\nd t that something where whoever if if the people who are making say in the this all when the were different ye um if they tie it to something like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they\nyou know what i mean\nthen or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time that would help\nbut the problem is exactly as said that you get you know y you don t have that information or it s lost in the merge somehow\nyep\nso\nwell can i ask one question\nit it to me that um we will have o an official version of the corpus which will be only one one version in of the where the are concerned\nwe d still have the the issue maybe if were done independently of the\nand you re get that\nbut but\nbecause if the data out people will do all of to it\nand s you know several from now you might want to look into um the prosody of\nand someone at the university of who where the\nright\nso you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data\nbut unfortunately they also hand it\n", "93": "then\nbut they also\nexactly\nand so that s exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data say that you know that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and people to try to do that\nyeah\nyep\nright\nwell then the\nwhat s what s wrong with doing times\ni agree\ni\nthat was what i was wondering\nyeah time is the\ntime is unique\nwell\nyou were saying that you t think we should\ntime is passing\ntime time times are ephemeral\nwas saying\nyeah\nwhat if they haven t with them times\nyeah\nhe he s a language modeling person though\num\nso so imagine\ni think his his example is a good one\nimagine that this person who the corpus of the t include time\n", "94": "yeah\nhe included to\nach\nwell then\nhe said that at this word is when when it\nyeah\nor she\nbut then t you just indirectly figure out the time tied to the word\nor she\nbut still they\nexactly\nsure\nyeah\nbut what if what if they change the\nnot\nwell\nbut you d have some point\nhe t have all the\nbut can they change the without the time of the word\nsure\nbut they could have it a little\nthe the point is that that they may have it off a word transcript that t the same as our word transcript\nso how do you merge it back in\ni understand what you re saying\n", "95": "", "96": "and i i guess the answer is um it s be different every time\nit s j it s just be\nyeah\nyeah\nyou only know the of the\ni it s exactly what i said before\nwhich is that what do you mean by merge\nso in this case where you have the and you don t have the times well what do you mean by merge\nright\nif you tell me what you mean i can write a program to do it\nright\nyou can merge at the level of the representation that the other person and that s it\nright\nand that s about all you can do\nand beyond that all you know is is relative\nand sometimes even that is wrong\nso so in so in this one you would have to do a best match between the
