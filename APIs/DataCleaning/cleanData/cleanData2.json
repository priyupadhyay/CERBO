{"argument No. 03-1488, Ulysses Tory v. Johnnie L. Cochran ": " Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this Court emphasized once again that statutory interpretation is a holistic process based on common sense, that the reading of the statute should look at all the words to avoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the text does not dictate it and the statutory history suggests otherwise.\n That was a case I dissented in, wasn't it?\n Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia, I think even you will find our case more appealing.\n Yes, but   but it is true you have a strong textual  \n We have an excellent textual argument.\n I was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.\n We do. A holistic reading of the text shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code  \n What does a holistic reading mean? Can you stay within the  \n Absolutely.\n   text and still be holistic?\n I'm not going to look outside the text at all. A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, which is on   in the petitioners' brief at pages 1 through 2  \n What does the word holistic mean? (Laughter.)\n I think it means read all the words in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word artificially. For example, when you look at a phrase like on account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in North LaSalle, account means a lot of different things, but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this statute.\n So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?\n I think it'd be partial, but I'm not sure.\n Well, let   let me ask  \n Sure.\n   ask you this. The   the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the   the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.\n Yes, and I think payments are triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of retirement payments. For individuals  \n Well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty.\n Right, and that's not  \n And   and that isn't then on the basis of age. Am I right? Is that   that was the problem the court had below.\n Yes, that's the problem the court had below. I think it's an illusory problem for the following reason. It's clear that the right to receive full enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until one of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the estate, death. And that's the right that we're talking about here, and that's why  \n Well, when you say full enjoyment, you   you think when   when I'm taxed on something, I   I don't have full enjoyment of it? The only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell   the only thing triggered by age   is your obtaining of a tax benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you can withdraw it without   without paying the 10 percent tax.\n That's correct, but the 10 percent tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a deterrent and a penalty.\n Well, I'm sure it does, but   but it's   it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n Well, Justice Scalia, the way that I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a penalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because the holistic sense, the full reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled, or ill people, once they get to the point where those triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur. Those are the same triggering events  \n Ms. Karlan, the   as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are   there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One thing that I don't know and may be of some significance, did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it over?\n Northrop Grumman's policy is to require individuals who leave the company's employment to roll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried to get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they were unable to do because of their health, they could have rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely exemptible.\n Another employer's plan.\n That's correct.\n But they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?\n No. This employer did not permit individuals to keep the money in the plan. They were told they had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.\n That was a term of the plan that it   you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?\n Apparently so.\n Are there any other plans that are   are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n All right. Well, then  \n Let me give you a couple  \n   then you might persuade me.\n Let me give you a couple of examples  \n Okay.\n   that I think will be quite familiar. A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money before you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and you pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so. The Federal Government's thrift savings plan for Federal employees allows you to take a loan out of the plan and to pay the interest back into your own account before you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving you free use of the money. If you don't pay the loan back, it's then treated as a   as a distribution, and you pay the 10 percent tax penalty on it. So that if you read this statute to   not to include IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this statute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern forms of defined contribution pension plans or savings plans.\n Yes. That was what I was going   aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock bonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n I thought they were all in the same boat. So what the effect of this rule is   of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to qualify  \n Yes, that's correct. You would render section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.\n Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit. Excuse me.\n Yes. I   I can see why you might have thought it was the Ninth Circuit. (Laughter.)\n It   it might be wrong anyway. (Laughter.)\n Yes, yes.\n What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?\n Well, in the Cilek case from the Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under the penalty process.\n And the   the payment here   it says   the statute uses the word payment. So suppose you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?\n It would be because it's the right to the future payments and not just the present payments, Justice Breyer.\n So   so   but I'm trying   what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take   just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a   a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.\n That's correct, Justice Breyer. But in order to protect the ability to take money out after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a half, there won't be any money there for him to take out. And that's why the exemption extends not just to present payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the debtor. And I can't emphasize  \n Ms. Karlan, let me ask something about that very point because the statute says that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor it's allowable.\n Yes, Justice O'Connor.\n Are you aware of cases where the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all that money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that. We'll just let you deduct X amount.\n Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the yellow brief on pages 19 through   to 20, I think is where we   where we talk about  \n Can we take this concrete case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something over $42,000.\n Yes.\n What was the claim here as to   was part or all of that   it would be some $54,000.\n The claim was all that all of that was necessary. If I could give an example that I think Justice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally require turnover of the entire IRA because people have time to earn the money back again. When the debtor has other retirement savings, for example, in a case from Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a 401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire IRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of at   will also require turnover of at least part of the IRA. In this case  \n What   what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that? It seems to me  \n Well, if the client is ill now, they get to keep it  \n No, no. They   they say my client is able-bodied now, but we   we need something because   I don't know   there's a history of family illness or something.\n There isn't a reported case that talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason of exempting the money.\n It's   I'm trying to figure out how   how   what the theory is. Is   you say I have a right to receive payments because of age. And you say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is   is   stops the   the younger person getting the money. So does the case then turn on that? I mean, suppose   suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work. What's the right analysis?\n I would say at the 1 percent and 80 percent of the people are taking the money out, it wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore. But if I can give another statistic that might be helpful in thinking about this. 18 percent of the participants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age of 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.\n What percent?\n 18 percent in one of the surveys. And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt under the bankruptcy  \n Well, they're taking out loans against it. They're   they're not withdrawing the money.\n Well, but the loans because   for example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially as close to taking out the money as you can get.\n I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first. How   how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language? If the   if your clients can take the money   just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why is it on account of age?\n It   it's not the   if you look at the statute   and let me just work my way through it with you. It's the right to a payment under a stock bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account of illness. And the question is what does on account of modify there. I think the most natural and sensible reading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a plan that is because of disability, and the like.\n So you say that payment doesn't   on account of doesn't modify payment.\n I don't   I don't think you need to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading here, especially given that the statute  \n Well, I   I think the logical reading is that it   it modifies payment.\n Well, I   I'm not sure that it does, but even if it did, Your Honor  \n Holistic for me. What   what does it   what does it modify? I mean, if you had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?\n Well, this is again   I know you dissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously crafted statute.\n No. I thought I was being holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth. (Laughter.)\n Okay. Okay.\n But  \n Well  \n   but what does on account of modify?\n I think what on account of modifies here is the kind of plan out of which the payment is coming.\n Where   where is that noun?\n There are a variety of plans, stock bonus, pension  \n The right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension  \n Yes.\n   profit sharing, annuity, or similar plan or   or contract. It's a plan on account of illness, an annuity?\n Plans  \n Why   why isn't it a right on account of?\n It's the right on account of.\n Well, I think you can read it either way and you'll get to exactly the same result. So let me read it the way that you've been reading it, which is if you want to protect the ability of people who have IRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to protect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for them to exercise their right to withdraw on account of age.\n Yes, but   but there still is a right to take payments at any time.\n Justice   Justice Kennedy, we don't believe  \n So   so then you're   you're  \n   that that's actually a right.\n Under that, you're giving the   the language that follows it no meaning.\n No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's entitled to exemption.\n But as purely English   as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is that right? The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age. That's the   a plan. That's the right. Now, your argument, I take it, was   is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age. So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.\n That's correct.\n It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty. And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered? And the language doesn't answer it. So  \n But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.\n Yes.\n No.\n No, because the savings account doesn't have   I mean, the savings account doesn't have the   the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got to read the right as meaning a right without penalty, because if you don't read it that way, then every one of these other retirement instruments is likewise going to fail? Isn't that your   your strong point?\n That's your strong point.\n That's correct. That's   that's our strong point and we're sticking with it. (Laughter.)\n Right. Right   it's not a right if you have to pay a penalty for it.\n That's correct. It's not a right, as we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk because if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.\n Right.\n And I think no matter how  \n That's a good argument. I like that.\n Thank you. (Laughter.)\n No matter how you read the statute, it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not cover many of the other  \n Why didn't Congress just put in IRA's along with the other things?\n They did, Justice Ginsburg. They did in the last line of the statute.\n Yes, but that's sort of an oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put it together with the other string of plans?\n Well, my best guess as to why they didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they stuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.\n What  \n What your   what your opponents say is that the   the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until   until you reach a certain age. And if they're structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to mention 408 in the   in the exceptions. What's wrong with that argument?\n Well, what's wrong with that, Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early withdrawal. So under their theory, there has   there is not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in the United States  \n Well  \n   that had that inability to take the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a half.\n Do   do we know that? I mean, couldn't someone   I   I don't think this is a very plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want the IRA to be, in   in effect, like an irrevocable trust in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create an IRA that would be as restricted as   as the circuit suggested it might be?\n I don't necessarily think so for the following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products. They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people buy. People don't usually negotiate the terms. If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's the second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax code. You then lose the ability to deduct the contributions going in. You then lose the ability to defer the payments on the income as it accrues in the account. Now, to answer the last part of your question, one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5 to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors. Why do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's are a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.\n And some don't. And the   and the State systems vary.\n That's correct, but only four States offer no protection to IRA's from creditors as opposed to  \n As opposed to how many who do?\n 46 States offer some kind of protection. 23 States protect them without limit in bankruptcy and out. 6 of them protect them inside of bankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as the amount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor's support.\n Well, that's what   with the purpose that we're talking about now  \n That's correct.\n   if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.\n No. No. 23 of them would protect all IRA's. 6 would protect all IRA's if the money in them is necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6 more would protect all the money in an IRA as long as it was deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all IRA's up to a dollar amount. In Nevada, the dollar amount is $500,000. 8 States use, as their State exemption law, an IRA that   a statute that has exactly the same language as the Federal statute. 6 of those State statutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to protect IRA's.\n But here there was no choice of picking up on the State?\n There's a   there's a weird anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means that you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person in Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his   in his IRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than electing the State exemptions.\n And one train that we didn't finish before. You were explaining that in this case the entire $55,000   that entire sum would be needed   would be necessary for the support of the debtors.\n That's correct. The bankruptcy court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't come within the meaning of section 522.\n But you   that was your claim, and I  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n How did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?\n Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an annuity that, I would guess   you know, I   I hate to do math in my head like this. I'd guess it would throw off a couple of hundred dollars a month in additional income. And so if you ask will the Rouseys need that money for their support, I think the answer is yes because their only other support  \n Well. Oh, yes.\n   is Social Security and a $2,000 a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and against which their Social Security will be offset. So when they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about to be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan reduces their benefits. So if the Rouseys are to have an old age in which they can afford to live in any kind of reasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.\n May I go back and just nail down one lose end in   in an answer that you   you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only no statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that you can make your IRA terms more restrictive without jeopardizing your qualification.\n I was unable to find one, Your Honor.\n Okay.\n I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Why didn't the Government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an amicus brief here from the Government, do we?\n I   no, we do not have one, and I don't  \n The Government has no position on the matter.\n Well, I   I don't think they've taken a position here. I will say that in Patterson against Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in their brief, I believe, as pension plans under section 408.\n There   they never go bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against any exemption from the   (Laughter.)\n Well   well, that's correct. The United States trustee may have wanted them to   I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Ms. McKiever.\n Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment is not exempt unless two requirements are met. First, the right to receive the payment must be on account of illness, disability, death, age or length of service, and the right must come from a specified similar plan or contract. Because neither of those elements is satisfied in this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.\n Is it   is it the case that other plans that are clearly covered by the text of this statute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?\n Yes and no, and let me explain that. Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain factors. Those are enumerated based   based upon each individual plan. However, they do not permit withdrawals for any reason at any time for any purpose.\n Not a single one of them.\n Not a single one of them. Now, of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none of the plans that I have ever seen, as the specified plans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.\n And you'd say that if one of them did, it would also not be covered.\n That's correct. It   it is thought  \n What   what  \n I take it   in   in answering Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that none of the   we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as   as restricted as the language in this   this statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a   in a very literal way.\n There are  \n In other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as   as you say the   the 401   the   the IRA is.\n That   that is correct. The   there probably are plans out there   once again, there are so many plans. And those are created by financial institutions, by employers, by different entities. So therefore there are thousands of variations of those.\n Now, why? Okay. Once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you. So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of holistic. So   so the   the point that I would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as pensions   I do. I think of it that way. I don't know much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?\n This is different because this is the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at any time for any purpose. It is also  \n I know that, but   but   and you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.\n That's correct.\n But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.\n Because the right to   to receive the payment, the right to access the money at any time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it does not meet the language of the statute. The statute very specifically  \n No, no. I   you've missed my point and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my following up. I shouldn't have.\n I'm sorry. Yes.\n My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.\n Because there is no causal connection between any of the factors that are enumerated in the statute and the right to receive the money. And that is  \n I  \n May I ask this question? Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an absolute prohibition, would you agree   on getting the money before you're 59 and a half, would then that qualify?\n Absolutely, yes, it would.\n Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?\n Clearly, there's a point at which it would qualify as a prohibition more than just  \n And what is it that makes it a prohibition? Is it   is it because the purpose is to deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically unacceptable? What   what is the reason for drawing the line somewhere above 10 percent?\n The reason for drawing the line is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated in   in the Huebner case, it   it said that it's a minimal penalty. However, there is still the unfettered access that's available.\n But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?\n I would assume as a disincentive to   to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition, such as the   the parking  \n But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.\n It would not be a prohibition, but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10 percent.\n So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.\n Clearly that   it's a very difficult line to draw. I   I can't make that call at this moment, but  \n It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right. But the fact that for a   an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are   you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.\n But the   the hallmark difference here is that it   it is the only type of account that you can access paying the penalty for any reason  \n I assume  \n   regardless of the specified reason.\n   that   that your answer to Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose of the statute is to make sure that people have money for their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any reason whatever, there is no security that that money will be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the reasons to sickness and   and a certain other number of emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for the retirement are much higher.\n Well, that   that's  \n Isn't that the answer?\n But if that's the answer, excellent. So now we have   (Laughter.)\n   let's say  \n Thank you, Justice Scalia.\n Let's try   let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money. Now, would   that you would say would fall within this.\n Yes.\n Fine, yes.\n Yes.\n Okay. Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old age   why isn't that just as good as the million percent tax in a world that is imperfect?\n Because clearly the   the access of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement, just as   as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the   the debtors to   to access freely for any purpose, clearly not showing that   that it would be for retirement purposes.\n But attachment of the  \n All right, but it's acquired. Say   say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60   it's not that bad   (Laughter.)\n 93.\n If   if that is going to be your criterion, the   the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why   why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future? Because the   the question then is going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to old age to   to allow for a continued exemption and how free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA category. You told us a few moments ago   and I'm sure you   you were right   that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up. So if   if we say that the   the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans. Aren't we?\n Not necessarily. The   the line that we're really looking to is that there has to be a direct causation factor between one of the five specified factors such as on   on account of factors, age, disability, death, length of service, and the right to receive the payment.\n Well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that. I mean, you   we would just have endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what doesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to draw here.\n Well  \n And every plan that I know of allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.\n And that's typically  \n In fact, that's what happened to these people. So I just don't see how your argument is going to  \n Well, the   the ability to access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do with the length of service, the years in service because they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full percentage. They're not fully vested until that time. Also, with the   when there are multiple factors existing in the right to receive the payments, each multiple factor can be a cause of the   of the ability to reach the money. When there are no meaningful factors imposed, though  \n Isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support? I mean, that   that seems to me a fall-back position that's provided for in the statute.\n I understand that   that may appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as   taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if it is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts, whether they are truly retirement accounts or   or if they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify under this statute. If   if you want to open it up and   and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under 522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on what can be potentially exempt under that statute.\n No. Well, obviously, it's   it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.\n That's correct.\n And it includes IRA's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n The section 408 reference is   does not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is a further condition to place on the   the exemption. First of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum requirements for an IRA to qualify as a   as a tax-favored plan. That  \n Ms.   Ms. Karlan says she doesn't know of any   of any IRA that did place a   a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the exemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that   that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?\n Absolutely. Those are customizable plans. Any person can go into  \n They can, but do   do you know that there's   there's one out there? I don't know  \n I   I do know of several out there.\n You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you? (Laughter.)\n I did not create one for this case. No, I did not. But they   they definitely exist. In fact, in the Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected that she would only receive periodic payments based upon her age, and that was found to be exempt by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel because that qualified. The payments were based upon her age, and it was then a similar plan because she could not access the funds at any time but only for the specified reason such as age.\n Was that   was that an IRA that she had? It was an IRA?\n My understanding is, yes, it was under section 408(b) was   that's my understanding based upon that case.\n Let me   let me ask you. Maybe this is irrelevant, but were   were these restrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is no, why would anyone so restrict his   his IRA?\n I   I do not know if that one specifically was, but no. These have not been set up through  \n But why   why would anyone do that? They're   they're qualified without these restrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his   his rights to   to withdraw?\n Clearly to protect the money potentially for retirement and   and just as  \n In other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?\n That's  \n I   I want to make it tough so that I   I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the motivation?\n Well, that would potentially be a motivation because clearly the money is there readily accessible at any time to   to buy anything that the debtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 30 or 40 years old can liquidate their   their IRA account, whereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't have that kind of access  \n Should we put any weight on the title, on the name? I mean, I   I can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress trying to fool people? (Laughter.)\n Was the Federal Trade Commission? Should they investigate? What   I mean, the   the   I think of it as an account that's basically aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at retirement, which has usually to do with age.\n Well, the   the name is clearly not determinative. Also, Congress in the   in the  \n I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any   I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any indication, when people passed this, that they didn't think they would be? Any   any reference in the terrible words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?\n Yes. First of all, Congress did historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status overall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account is set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e)   522(d)(10)(e) requirements that   that are much more stringent in the requirements of the traditional IRA.\n Well, are they? Because there was one statement   I think it was in Ms. Karlan's brief   that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as long as you're willing to pay the penalty.\n That's a misnomer that that's a   a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow as a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to payment. They have the right to borrow the funds. However   for example, in the New York Police Department pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their pension plan funds. However, they   as long as they're employed there, they have to continue to repay that.\n What   what if they don't repay it? What's the sanction?\n There is a 10 percent penalty. However, as the bankruptcy  \n But what   where   where would the   where would the principal repayment come from? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the balance was from the   the person's account.\n That would be correct.\n I mean, we call it   the   the loan feature then boils down to a   a withdrawal subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the plan.\n Plus 10 percent you say.\n That's correct. However  \n So it's just   just like an IRA.\n But   but this is in the bankruptcy context, which makes it completely different. The bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a picture in time. At the time that the debtor files the bankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the debtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor has at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-year look-back period. But because it's a picture in time, it's what the   the debtor can reach is what the   the bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that   that the debtor owns. This is very different than the pension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have   have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there, would be present at the retirement. But because they could have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the ability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially reach. There are other exemptions, of course, set forth in   in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry, but the assets that are not exempt are readily available to repay creditors, for   for the benefit of the creditors. Therefore, that   that makes it significantly  \n Subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?\n That's correct. That's correct.\n The   the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view.\n That's correct. Yes, they do. They do. Additionally, the petitioners' IRA's are   by allowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the other plans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much more like a savings account. It's not any form of deferred compensation. They can't look to that to fill a salary void after they retire because the money may not be there. Unlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, they could have liquidated those funds prior to their reaching any age or any illness that   that may befall them.\n But there   there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.\n That's correct. That is correct. That is correct. But the   the key here  \n Let me just get   get straight what   what the   what the universe of plans we have in front of us here. Do you assert that there are no other plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?\n That's correct. None of the specified plans listed, the   the ones enumerated.\n Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.\n That's correct.\n None of them is like that.\n None of them is like that. They all have specific factors. There has to be a causal connection between the ability to access the money. Additionally, it's very important that   that an account or plan that qualifies under the statute   it has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. And there's no question that there are definitely IRA's that   that could and do qualify for this exemption. It is, instead, that  \n Do   do you disagree with Ms. Karlan that this is   this is a standardized product so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the standard product.\n That's not   that's not correct. There are many customizable products that are   are out there. In fact, for example, when employers set up different kinds of plans for their employees, they go and they can choose from many different options. For example, they can choose if they even have a   a loan provision built into a   a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the IRA. They   they can be customized because section 408 only sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify for tax-favored status. That   that is an Internal Revenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit additional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it allows the   the individual or the employer because some   there are two different types of IRA's that can be set up by an employer   to go and customize those so that they could potentially meet the statutory requirements.\n These   these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason   what happens if you withdraw for any reason?\n That  \n What is the sanction against   I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for   for a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What   what is the sanction?\n My understanding is that   is that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed by those plans, that that is prohibited. And that   that is similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds in the   she could no longer reach the corpus of the account. The   the lump sum of money was there for her retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the money is not protected at any time. There's no prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds from the account other than the payment of the penalty. But whether an account or plan qualifies under the statute, it   it   you look at the language of the plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument renders the terms of the statute superfluous because, first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans, and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is not based upon any factor other than the   the account holder wanting to withdraw the funds.\n The right to receive 100 percent is   is dependent on a factor, isn't it?\n Yes, it is.\n Yes. At least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.\n That's correct. Unless you have   or another factor such as for education or for a home loan, something like that. There are several different reasons that you can   you can reach the money and not pay a penalty. However, the penalty is not   is not the deciding factor. It's their ability to access the funds at any time that   that makes that a right of payment. It's not a right of payment without a penalty. It's just that the right to payment exists at all times.\n You don't dispute that   that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.\n That   that   that is   appears to be correct. I don't have those exact statistics, but yes, that   that appears to be correct, that they have   that they may not exercise that at   in great numbers. First of all, going back to the causation factor about the   the ability of the debtors to withdraw the funds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 203 North LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean because of, and that   that is a key point here because if the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is not because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case, this Court found that that reading, the because of reading, absolutely applies to this section of the   the Bankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a direct causal connection is required between the right to receive the payment in the on account of requirements. In   in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever between the right to receive the payments and   and any of the factors enumerated in the statute.\n The words, on account of, in this   this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things. You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things. You may get the same amount whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms of the plan are.\n That's correct. There are, of course, always some other factors, such as you have to first deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But once those barriers are passed, then   then the right to receive the payment has to be at least   one of the causes must be one of these factors. And it has to be enumerated in the plan. It cannot be for any reason, but must be an enumerated reason in the plan. And the   with the penalty, only the avoidance of a penalty is based upon the   the age of the debtor or the   or any of the factors. It's   section 522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status or to the right to receive the payment without penalty. It's only the right to receive the payment overall.\n Does your argument draw a ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument prevails, then these other plans would be affected as well.\n Only to the extent that   that they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute. If   if they are available for payment at any time for any reason, then   then they would not qualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're payable for   for one of the factors and that there's a direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and   and the factors, then   then they would qualify for the exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It is just the types that   currently that the petitioners would have or that people would have that would allow the access at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for exemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist, that can exist. It's just that people have set these up from standard plans allowing them access. Whether they access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory requirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can and do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that the petitioners' don't. The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to claim this exemption. The   the debtors knew or   or potentially should have known that   that their IRA's were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time that they filed because of the way that   that these had been construed for a long period of time. So that they could have set up accounts that did qualify for such exemption, but   but they did not restrict their access in that way. Thank you.\n Thank you, Ms. McKiever. Ms. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're not required to use it all.\n I'm going to retire early. (Laughter.)\n The   the first point is that there are two rights under IRA's: the right after age 59 and a half or upon death or disability or illness to withdraw the money without any kind of penalty; and there's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiary right, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to a penalty earlier. The existence of that second entirely subsidiary, almost never used right   and the statistic on this is in the green brief at page 23   means that the real essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age. The second point. As this Court said last year  \n You don't really have a right to receive it on account of age. You have a right to receive it without a penalty on account of age.\n Well, at the age of  \n It isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age. It's the right to receive the money without paying a tax.\n Well, that's a right that's very important because let me give you just a mathematical example of the difference.\n It is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says. The statute says  \n The statute gives that right.\n   the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.\n And you do have that right. You also have another right. But the existence of that second right doesn't negate the first right. The statute doesn't here, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you   a plan is eligible only if you have solely the right to receive on this  \n No, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service. And   and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't   doesn't qualify. I mean, I would think that that's  \n That might be your first thought, but then  \n Or   or at least   at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.\n Oh, but I think even if that were your first thought, you would then get to the implication that many of the Justices have been pressing today, which is the implication of that for all plans is tremendous because all plans give   well, I shouldn't say all plans, but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you early access to your money, and that's valuable to you. That's why in section  \n Is it true that none of them give unfettered access? They're all qualified in some fashion. Do you agree with that?\n Well, the qualification of hardship has been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to buy a house and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You want to sent your kid to school and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You have huge, you know, consumer loans and you could consolidate that? That's a hardship. So it's not as if IRA's operate differently from everything else in the system. That's why  \n Well, yes. You   you don't have to make up a hardship. You just say I want the money. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.\n I think that's  \n I don't even have to lie about the hardship. I mean   (Laughter.)\n I need the money. I don't have the money. That's a hardship. If you   if all you have to say is the magic word hardship, I think that's why we would say IRA's are similar plans or contracts because this Court has made it clear similar is not the same thing as identical. So if similar reasons allow you to withdraw, that's enough. And that's why in section  \n In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?\n As I read the New York City  \n Without any qualification for disability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me the money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan that works like that?\n I don't know, but the New York City Police Department plan appears to work like that. You can take the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.\n Has any judge ever taken the view that   adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that while you can't put the whole IRA   exempt the whole IRA, but you can exempt 10 percent of it?\n Not to my knowledge.\n At least you ought to get that much, it seems to me, under his   his analysis.\n We'd be happier with 10 percent than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that way. The second point is a point that comes out of this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a line that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, which IRA's do. And this may have led to some of the confusion, I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement account. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an individual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you put money into while the money accumulates before you're ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that are customizable. And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at all or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that they would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for a customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible. That's why we think the most sensible reading of the statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them is necessary for the support of the debtor. Thank you.\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is the safety of police officers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in an inherently unsafe situation.\n May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips? Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?\n Well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit because  \n But it wasn't   it wasn't in the questions  \n This Court  \n   on which we granted cert?\n This Court in Procunier treated the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the underlying merits of the case and   and, in fact, skipped over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address the qualified immunity issue. And presumably  \n How   how  \n   the Court could do the same thing here.\n How do we do it? It goes right to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close question as to whether the police did or did not exceed the reasonable bounds   reasonable bounds. Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury verdict against you, and   and then I think, well, yes, but I begin to come   become disturbed if I think of qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So   so having read through the thing, I   I preliminarily start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive force, I mean, given   you know, I'm using that in quotes.\n Right.\n The jury said it was. Who am I to say it wasn't  \n Well, I mean, this   this  \n   in that situation? But qualified immunity. So now, what do I do?\n Well, in the first instance, it's reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here. This Court has already  \n We   don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or  \n With respect to the historical facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you have   that   that's subject to clearly erroneous review. On the issue of whether or not the conduct at issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at least a mixed issue of fact  \n Well, a lot of it may depend on the  \n   and law that this Court has decided as de novo.\n   on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and   and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.\n It   it seems to me that   Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in Michigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law. To be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be   and obviously the officers' position in this case   is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and   and candidly of the other individuals who were being   being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.\n Have you responded to my initial question? Have you said all you want to say about qualified immunity?\n No, Justice O'Connor. My   my basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a   a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and   and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances. So if I   if I cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously I   I hope I can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there   that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.\n Well, what is the   what is the function of a jury in this case? What does the jury verdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we know from the jury verdict. Other   I think what you're saying is that these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a demurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n I   I'm not saying that that would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and   and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the  \n We don't know the fact   what facts were found because all we have is in the jury verdict that this was excessive force. Period. That's all.\n But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg. So the   the facts that you know are the facts as they're described  \n But it's like was  \n   by the respondent's brief.\n   the defendant negligent. Is that more or less a conclusion of law? We don't know in what respect from the jury verdict. And here, were these police officers acting   did they use excessive force.\n Well, we know precisely what they did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the   of the search. We know that. There's no   there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.\n Wasn't there a fact issue as to whether she was handcuffed for   even for a short period after the search had been completed?\n I don't think there is a factual question like that because I don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case. There   there was never an argument made to the jury that this   that this extended beyond the   the period of the end of the search. The argument that was made to the jury was that the search should have   should have been limited to the room where the suspect was   was a resident or that the police should have made a decision somewhere in the   before the end of the 2-hour search that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they were arguing that   that it even went a little further in terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth Amendment violation in its own right.\n But if   but if it made a difference as a matter of law, what   what should we assume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that they found the facts in the way that the   a plaintiff argues them or that you think they are?\n I think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you   and   and the jury determined that there   that it was unreasonable, then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact   that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to whether that's de minimis under the circumstances. But   but I agree. I mean, obviously there is a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean, this Court has already decided that in the Fourth Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.\n Now, in doing it as a matter of law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in this case, if   if I remember correctly, one of the officers testified that had they followed normal protocol, once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the building, the   the main building  \n Well, the   all of the grounds actually.\n Is that the whole compound?\n Yes.\n That   that they would have   they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he wasn't sure why they didn't. We   do we   do we consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as   as to what is or is not excessive?\n I think if this Court could determine that, as a matter of course, the   the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis. That   I think what's important to keep in mind in this context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about four individuals who are being detained under these circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for the police officers under the   under   when trying to decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing. So, you know, is it possible that police procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes that he can take away   you can remove the handcuffs? That may be, although I don't think there's much in the record here to   to reflect that. But what the police said here   and I think it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified that if something had gone wrong, if either a police officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a   in the context of executing the search warrant, the first question that would have been asked is what was the least that could have been done to prevent those injuries from occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite rightly   and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace under the unquestioned command theory of   of law   is that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of a reasonable search, we will make our way through the search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order to minimize the detention and we will eliminate   and I mean, literally eliminate   the entirety of the risk either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.\n Okay. I take it you obviously don't want us to   to come down with a kind of a finicky version of   of excessive force as the touchstone, and I take it you don't want us to come down with simply a blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do anything in   in restraining occupants so long as it is not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a   a statement that would be the kernel of the holding that you want?\n I'm   I'm quite comfortable with the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you   you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in order to  \n But in the facts there, there were no handcuffs. He   he was just detained. So  \n I understand that, and   but my   my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation.\n So   I mean, I don't   would   would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for   for purposes of applying Summers?\n Yes, but it's important to put that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to the   not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant. It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we know that there has either been a crime that's likely to be taking place in the premises. It only   it only extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's only when the search is for contraband, not just for any evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and anybody else who happens to be on site.\n Well, it doesn't   why is contraband magical? Wouldn't   wouldn't your point be when   when the reason they're investigating gives cause to believe that there may be physical danger  \n Justice Scalia  \n   from letting people wander around?\n   absolutely.\n Which is the case with contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons as well.\n I think the important point here is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These are guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more dangerous than any other circumstance the police are likely to confront.\n But would you be happy then with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm Summers and   but Summers said special circumstances or possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case. And the only verdict part that I think we're concerned with here   it was not about four people. It was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena, the jury found that there was a violation of her   of her Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have found   you said   I don't know if you misspoke. You said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it, I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs, both after the time they had secured the place and also after the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.\n Well, it   it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained  \n But, Mr.   Mr.   but may I point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue to the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to release an individual detained in connection with a lawful search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever is sooner.\n Right. That   I understand that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record and it was never argued to the jury that this search   that   that her detention lasted beyond the period of the search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police officers specifically said in his closing argument, there is no issue but that she was released at the time of the   that when   as soon as the search was   was ended, the   the warrant was executed.\n I wonder why the judge gave this instruction then.\n Because   because what he's   well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.\n And why   why there was   there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one. But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page 255 of the joint appendix  \n Yes.\n One question concerns whether the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable? Those two questions   my first is a procedural question. Did counsel for the defendants object to the jury getting   those two questions being submitted to the jury?\n No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't. And   and  \n Well, it seems to me that the judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is whether there was a   a detention, was force greater than was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the duration was longer than reasonable under the circumstances.\n Right. Justice Ginsburg, you have to put that in context. The argument of the plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have ended at either of two points: after they had completely cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at some point after that when they had asked her questions and determined that she had no particular involvement with Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found, was that that was the reasonable break point. Our argument is that's not consistent with the notion of unquestioned command and   and is wrong as a matter of law. And there is no evidence   no evidence. There was no testimony that she was kept for a period beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very important to understand that.\n And you're saying that the   the mere fact that it   it went to the jury, even went to the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we have to listen to what the jury said. Is that   is that  \n Right. If it's wrong as a matter of law, that's   then that's absolutely right. But there was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The only thing he said was, he   he didn't remember. That was   the question was put to the police officer. Was she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it. There's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally made up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of the jury. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n You might save your time. Yes. Mr. Shanmugam.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: When executing a search warrant to investigate a violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate the orderly completion of the search. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the Fourth Amendment. Under the standard for excessive force claims first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers, the degree of force used here was not excessive. The same considerations that justified the detention of the occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use of handcuffs during the detention.\n Then this case should not have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said  \n We  \n   because you   you just said that this   the handcuffs   the circumstances   the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.\n Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. It is our view that as a matter of law, the officers would have been entitled to prevail on the constitutional issue with regard to excessive force. And it's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for summary judgment. They also orally moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence, and that motion was denied. Now, we also believe that the jury, quite frankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by Justice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the jury only received one very general instruction on Summers detentions.\n Well   well, has the   the objection to the instruction been preserved here?\n Perhaps an argument could be made that it's fairly included within the questions presented. There was an objection made at trial and an objection made before the Ninth Circuit as well, but our fundamental position is that the jury was simply given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue. This instruction  \n But on the   on the question whether they preserved the issue, I   I took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question. They did not object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an instruction as such.\n That's correct.\n But they   they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?\n I think that's true. It is true that they didn't object to the specific special verdict set of questions. I think they proposed slightly different language. But ultimately I think our primary submission is that as a matter of law on these facts, no constitutional violation occurred.\n When you   is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the   that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?\n We would concede, I think, Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where there are disputed issues of historical fact. We would submit that there are no relevant  \n Well, but is   is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than   than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?\n Well, there are certain  \n It's historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive. Is that any different from the question as   of was this seizure unreasonable? If you submit the one to the jury, you may as well submit the other.\n Justice Scalia, those facts may be disputed in a particular case. We would submit that they really weren't disputed here, but there may actually be a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used handcuffs and the  \n So when  \n   or no we didn't use handcuffs.\n   when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not.\n We believe that it is  \n It's not a matter of law.\n   a mixed question of fact and law, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially  \n Why   why any more so   why any   any more so than   than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?\n Well, we would submit that it is no different from the question whether officers had probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a question subject to de novo review, over your dissent, admittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their conduct.\n Are   are you saying that the only basis on   on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the   the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?\n We believe that that certainly is the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact  \n Well, I think you have to say that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you know, the handcuffs   the police had a right to do that, but she was held too long, she was   they   they yelled at her, she was taken into a   a place that was uncomfortable. If   if that's true, then we have to sustain the jury verdict.\n I think that the handcuffing was the key factor at trial, and I think that the best evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her excessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not part of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.\n No, no. But the instruction that was given   and one was read that's in the briefs   it seems to me a   a perfectly good instruction.\n I think that that's true, but I think that the instruction didn't really provide any guidance on excessive force specifically. It was really an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the detention more generally, rather than with regard to excessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v. Connor type instruction.\n Well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this   the denial of that instruction here.\n Well, there were objections to the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps an argument could be made   and perhaps Mr. Phillips will make the argument on rebuttal   that it is fairly included within the questions presented.\n I don't know how you can   you can say that the only thing that was before the jury was the handcuff when the   there was evidence that she was treated very roughly in   in the first instance, she was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for her life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the jury was asked to determine.\n Justice Ginsburg, it was the primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were other issues. I think that the other relevant use of force was the initial detention at gunpoint, but   and those   and I would add that those are the two factors on which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's verdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the initial use of force and with regard to the continued use of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support the officers' use of force in both instances.\n But   but may I just ask a sort of very basic question? One of the instructions reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it   if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you telling us that you think the answer to that question is a question of law that the judge should provide rather than the jury?\n Assuming that that instruction is correct   and that might very well be a valid instruction  \n Well, it was correct.\n It may very well be a correct instruction  \n All right.\n   with regard to a challenge to the manner of the detention itself. In that instance, then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I think even then the teaching of Ornelas  \n Then it's not a question of law. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact to the jury?\n It is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is  \n It's a mixed question?\n The jury's job is to   to resolve the underlying factual issues and then  \n Well, I understand the historical fact, but I'm   I'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by the jury or entirely by the judge?\n We believe that that actually is ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of whether or not probable  \n So this instruction should not have been given.\n That's correct  \n I thought your position was that it   it may be submitted to the jury, but that it may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's the way we are able to set standards for later cases.\n I think that's exactly right, and I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas. And it may very well be that a more specific instruction should have been given so as to make clear that the jury had specific issues of historical fact to resolve. But ultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in the sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely the reasons given in Ornelas. And if I could just say a couple words on the substantive issue of excessive force. We believe that in cases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely be allowed to use handcuffs. In this case, I would just add that there were several additional case-specific factors that justified the use of handcuffs. In addition to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two members of a violent gang were living at the house. In addition, the officers had previously visited the house on two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions. And our fundamental problem with the Ninth Circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers in the course of a detention should really stop and investigate whether or not each   each individual that they encounter poses a safety threat. And we believe that that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise. It would effectively divert officers from the primary task at hand and could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather than expediting the completion of the search. And for that reason, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's rule, its substantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.\n How long did it take them to find out whether the   these other dangerous people were there?\n To find out whether?\n Whether the people they were afraid of were   were on the premises?\n Well, you know, I don't know that they ever actually made a   a determination other than that Mr. Romero was not on the premises. I think they figured that out once they had actually identified each of the individuals, which was fairly early on in the detention.\n Thank you. Mr. Hoffman.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Let me start on the issue of   that Mr. Phillips said we made up. Actually we didn't make it up. The claim that Ms. Mena was detained past the time of the search was made throughout the case. If you look at footnote 3 in the Ninth Circuit opinion in 2000, the issue of the length of the detention was a factual issue that precluded summary judgment. Ms. Mena claimed that the detention lasted for 2 to 3 hours. The officers claimed that it lasted 90 minutes. But more than that, the   the jury   the   the special verdict asked the jury to find whether Ms. Mena had been kept for a longer time than reasonable, and in fact, in the closing argument, it was argued that Ms. Mena had been kept beyond the time that the search ended. And not only is there not any   not only is there evidence in the record, there is overwhelming evidence in the record that Ms. Mena was kept for a period of time, at least 30 minutes, give or take, and possibly as long as an hour. And this is not based on Ms. Mena's testimony.\n Do you find that the   that the   do you define the end of the search as before they started videotaping everything they had done?\n Well, they were videotaping during the course of the search. But if I can go through the facts which might clarify things. Officer Muehler, who was the officer in overall charge of the   of the search, testified at trial that the search ended at 8:40 a.m. Officer Brill said a little bit later than that. He tied   but there's a second video. There are two videos. The second video is from 8:50 to 8:57. At the time that the second   the second video started at 8:50, Officer Brill testified that the search was over. The   the evidence log   the last entry on the evidence log is 8:45 in terms of evidence being logged into the   into the case. Officer Brill testified that Ms. Mena was kept for at least 10 or 15 minutes after the end of the second video and her handcuffs were not released until she was brought back around from the   the separate converted garage back into the house and  \n Where   where is that testimony?\n The testimony   Officer Brill's testimony? Is actually   they cite joint appendix number   on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked   they continue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was released? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or 15 minutes after 8:57. In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually consistent with prior testimony by the videographer herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted. The   the point being   and if you take the distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was   was kept in handcuffs at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account. And one of the ironies of the case is that there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search ended. And so while this  \n But not from these premises.\n No. But in fact, this was a   the search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up at his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had   was   was to radio the start of both searches, and so there was  \n But the   the   I thought that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called   that the warrant covered weapons that were there.\n Yes.\n That they were looking for weapons.\n They were looking for a gun.\n They were not looking for a gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?\n Well, I think the  \n Did they have a warrant, a search warrant?\n I think the warrant covered   I think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and   and the   I believe the warrant  \n Well, this was a   this was a pretty extensive search warrant that they had.\n Yes.\n Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the  \n Well, it's the same warrant I believe, Your Honor, in terms of   we don't have   there's not a lot of information in the record about  \n Well, wasn't   I thought that this warrant referred to a particular address, a particular house, not   not any house where one might find Romero.\n No, no, no. It   it referred to the two houses, one on Cimmaron.\n Well, was the other house his mother's house?\n Yes. The location number one is his mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's   and Officer Muehler and this team was in charge of both of these searches pursuant to the same warrant. They had information that   the reason they did that is that they had information that   that he lived in this poorhouse, that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and that he also visited his   his mother from time to time.\n Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and   and the mother   nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this   they knew pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.\n Well, they knew right away.\n Yes. And that's, I guess, your   your point, that the place where the dangerous man was is not  \n I think that that explains one of the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here because they   they knew that at 8:45, at the time that Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the officers were out of the house and   and everything was done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana possession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted garage with her hands behind her back.\n You might be able to keep your verdict, I   I think. But I think the problem here is the Ninth Circuit   you go to the Ninth Circuit and you say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's definition for reasons that you say. And   and the Ninth Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a half pages written the reason that this was unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about her immigration status, which you   I don't think you even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's   that's the bulk of the   of   of   that's the bulk of the analysis. And   and these are the words that I think they're objecting to. And by any standard of reasonableness, Mena was   the   the officers should have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long before the   the   because she wasn't a threat. And that was long before the end of the search. And what their point is on that is, you know, if that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT teams because they can't operate that way. They   they can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual   if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there for the search for a couple of hours, then they release her. Now, that's their argument. So they're objecting not so much to   to the fact they have to pay $30,000   or they may object to that. But they're   they're objecting to the holding of the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again, though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way not to do it. But   but I want to know your view of what I see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong.\n Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd   I'd say that the   the Court could affirm the judgment in this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that we  \n Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.\n And in fact   and I   I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.\n Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications  \n Right.\n   of the Ninth Circuit's analysis  \n Right.\n   not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.\n I think   I think that there   I would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two parts really. On the questioning issue, I would just say that that   that was not an issue that was presented to the jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment violation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the Ninth Circuit. What we did   we did say in our   in our brief to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to   to Summers detention. We did say that.\n Well, we could say is their opinion   that's their opinion. It's beside the point, et cetera.\n Right. So, I mean, I   I think on questioning, you know, we   we haven't been pushing that issue.\n If   if two of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without   to make the judgment without taking those two factors into account?\n Well, I think what   first of all, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on. The jury found that she had been detained longer than was reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This is a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that. And we've argued in our brief that if the Court did something on questioning, it would really be issuing an advisory opinion in this   in this situation. And, you know, we've   we've argued the point and we're prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that question because it's obviously an important question. In our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that that's contested.\n Well  \n I don't  \n   well, it does seem to me that  \n Excuse me.\n It   it does seem   seem to me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on   on this key point of when she had to be released. The officers should have released her when it became clear she posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.\n Well  \n I think that is critical to its holding.\n Well  \n And that implies that they have a   a duty at the outset to determine whether   what her status is rather than to go around looking for guns and   and to secure the premises. That's   that's one of my concerns with that.\n Well, I would have a different position on that. First of all, I think that the judgment can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of this issue because it was a   a jury verdict and   and the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question 5 or 6.\n The   the first ground being? Just an unreasonably long  \n Detained beyond the   the length of the search. And so I think technically the judgment can be affirmed on that ground. But with respect to the handcuffing, the position that we would say is that, first of all, you   you would have to view the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. Now, it's been   there's been a lot of questioning about what that means and what the jury's role is. As we understand it, if Ornelas applies to this decision, which we assume the Court would do   and that is, that you would first have to take the light   all the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, including the possibility that the   the jury rejected as being incredible the statements that the officers made in terms of justification, if there was evidence in the record to show that there was contradicting evidence, which there is in this record. And so the facts that   that the other side has tried to argue are the facts on which you would make that constitutional decision are not the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. In the light most favorable to the verdict, there was   there was lots of planning. There was a tactical plan in writing that the jury got to see, which said that the   the plan here was to go in and make the SWAT entry, to see if there were non-suspects there. They would be patted down, identified, and released. The jury was entitled not to believe the other side's claim that they didn't say when they were going to be released and believed that the plan was to release them as soon as it was ascertained that they did not have the connection in   in the situation. And in fact, there's testimony from the officers that they knew that they weren't gang members and they knew that they weren't connected to the crime. And they were completely cooperative, and they didn't resist arrest and they didn't flee. And Iris Mena is 5 foot 1   5 foot 2 inches, and the jury had a videotape of exactly how they looked. The officers had a total plan. They   they exercised their command of the situation from the beginning. They cleared it. They made sure it was safe. They took people outside through the pouring rain, which actually they say there wasn't evidence about that.\n Medium   medium rain.\n Well, actually at   at joint appendix number 183, Officer Allegra, who was one of the entry team, said it was pouring. So   and in fact, the stipulation of facts said it was heavy. So Iris Mena was being   was being demure when she talked about that. You can even see the rain on the videotape. And so they took her outside. They took all of them outside. They put them in this little room, which is not connected to the house. They had one or two armed officers outside. There was no place for them to go. They couldn't interfere with the facilitation of the search because they were in this room. They couldn't flee because there's only one way out, a door. There were two armed guards there. And   and if all they had to do was sit these four people, who were not connected to any gang activity, as to which they had no suspicion ever developed that they had any connection to Mr. Romero, who had already been arrested at his mom's house  \n They can't have a flat rule that while you're conducting a search, you   you can restrain anybody that you find assuming the search is for a crime that   that involves violence.\n Well, I think that the  \n I don't want to have to make that call all the time, you know.\n Well, but   but officers do make that call all the time. They make it in the context of Terry stops. They make it in the context of lots of Fourth Amendment issues. In Summers   in Summers, the man was detained. In many of the post-Summers cases, including many cited by the other side and the Government, handcuffing is not viewed as routine. Handcuffing is viewed as something that substantially aggravates the nature of the seizure  \n If that's true, is it routine in   I mean, here what sort of pushes the other way on this is this is a dangerous gang. They have lots of weapons and they have previously gone to this house, which I gather   sometimes when I read it, I think it's like a warren of little rooms. On the other hand, maybe it isn't. I haven't seen the house. There are a lot of buildings around, and they think a lot of people here   we don't know who's what, and we make a mistake in this and we're dead. You know, I mean, so that's painting it the other way. But where you have guns and   and houses and gangs and so forth, now that's why they say that it's reasonable in those circumstances to say, when we find someone in the house, we handcuff them through the search. We might let them go earlier, but that's up to us and we don't want the courts second guessing us on that. Now, what's   what's painting it their way, and I'd like you to respond.\n I   I understand that. I guess the   the problem with that is that that means that no matter who they find   and in this case is a good example of it. They were worried that they might find the gang member who had a gun there, and that's what they were looking for. Okay. And so they used the SWAT team. That seems perfectly reasonable that they would use a SWAT team the way they did. And they went in and within literally 4 or 5 minutes, they had   this is a tiny, little house. They had cleared the house. They had figured out all the occupants. They put them in a room completely under their control where they couldn't get away from anything. They knew there were two 40-year-old people, a young hippie, and   and an 18-year-old girl that was 5 foot  \n Did they search that room?\n Yes. They searched that room. So the room was searched before they went there. They searched all the rooms. They searched Ms. Mena's room and found absolutely nothing there. And   and the testimony   and this goes to Justice Souter's question.\n Did they   did they search the individuals too to make sure  \n Yes.\n I assume they did.\n Oh, yes. They   they searched the individuals. They   they   you know, they completely made sure that   that when they put them in that back room, there was nothing in the room. There was nothing on the individuals. There was nothing that   that could cause them danger. And   and the jury, I think, was entitled to   to look at those facts and   and to hear the facts and to see the facts  \n How did the qualified immunity question get resolved here?\n Well, the  \n And what   what role did that play in all of this?\n Well, at the   at the district court level, the   the district court heard a rule 59. But one of the things about this case is it was tried right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got to decide qualified immunity. This was June 2001 actually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether the proper standard of qualified immunity had been applied. The district judge, looking at the facts, found that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the search. The district judge found that. And then in   in the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of these issues. And basically the   the qualified immunity   on the   on the over-detention claim, I think they've conceded that there just isn't any justification for   I mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes. I mean, that   this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is too long on a   on a Terry stop when there's actually reasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her. With respect to the handcuffing issue  \n Is it clear that it was 30?\n Well, I think in viewing the light most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to assume that   that the jury could have found an hour. But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got something that just could not possibly be considered de minimis under any kind of exception. And   and that's why they fought it on the facts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at any point in this. And with respect to handcuffing, I think our position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all, doesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has consistently tried to equate detention with restraint. And I think what   what Summers indicated was that this Court was willing to allow people to be detained during the course of a search for three specific reasons. And when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the justifications, this Court specifically said it was endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be very much different asking someone to sit around  \n Doesn't that just go to the point that it's not clearly established at least?\n Well, no. I   I don't think that is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in   in   Summers doesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks about having to justify force based on a   on a Fourth Amendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the Court, first of all, used the   the analysis that we have argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out in an unreasonable manner.\n Well, but that was ill individual, a single individual  \n Well  \n   unclothed, et cetera  \n No. I   I understand that the facts were more egregious, but the   the Court's analysis for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity standpoint   for a reasonable officer reading that opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One is that the proper analysis to determine whether handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is   is allowed has to be decided under the kinds of justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham analysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of cases that   that allow officers to do that. Lots of lower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out differently depending on the facts and circumstances confronted. The second thing, the   the point about the disabled person and the particular facts made that case particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those were additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit didn't say that the constitutional standard was particularly abusive or egregious. It   it applied traditional Fourth Amendment analysis. And finally and I think very important and not dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is that the Ninth Circuit in   in Franklin rejected a blanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in Portland. The Portland police department had a policy that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search is over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that kind of policy because Summers and   and Graham require it to be individualized justification for that   for an additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's allowed in Summers. And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing to what it   to   to the circumstances in Dunaway, to   to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of the   the issues here. If   if the  \n And what do we do if we think the Ninth Circuit was off base in   in whether Mena could be questioned about her immigration status?\n Well, I   I think that  \n That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.\n Well, it's certainly   it's certainly an alternative ground. It's not   it doesn't affect, I think, our verdict. And so I think what   I mean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as improvidently granted, could say to the court that it   that it should reverse that part of the ruling.\n It might be useful to say they were wrong in  \n Well, that   you   you could say that. I mean, I would   on the merits of the question, I   I would like to   if we were reaching that, I would argue that the Ninth Circuit   that   that there is   there should be a limit on questioning in a   in a Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of Terry analysis that the majority of the   the circuits apply.\n What   what will do if we thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word, disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That   that was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted garage with a bed.\n Well, I mean  \n I mean, I   I thought this woman was standing in   by some grease rack or something and she was  \n She wasn't standing by a grease rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door because the door had basically been obliterated on a very cold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and after   and had been taken through the   the pouring rain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a coat or shoes. And she was made to sit by there and she was very cold and uncomfortable. And she did complain that the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that they were uncomfortable and could they be removed. It's not a garage in   in the way that the vision of it, but also if you look at it, it's   and the   the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of this. You could see that the   the occupants were made to be in a very uncomfortable situation that was unnecessary. And that   that was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994. I think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994 search. You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-suspect as to whom the   the officers didn't have that   that kind of   of suspicion. And the Fifth Circuit found that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to the officers. So from our standpoint, on the issue of being detained past the time, I think it's just a clear case. I think the other side has conceded that if   if there's this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment has to be affirmed on that basis. On   on the handcuffing issue, we believe the same principle has to apply because the facts have to be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and when you view those facts, I   it   it is   no reasonable officer would believe you could do those things to Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the time. And I think that it would be   what the   what the United States and   and what petitioners' counsel is asking for is really for a radical change of law themselves. We're happy with Summers and Graham and the way that applies, and the   the jury instruction was based on   on Summers and Graham and on Franklin. The language is taken directly from those cases. And   and the   the jury in a case like this   qualified immunity obviously provides some protection for   for officers that when   when a reasonable officer wouldn't know these things. But jury verdicts also play a crucial role in a civil rights case. In this case, a jury of our community found that Iris Mena had been subjected to an abuse of   a specific abuse of authority in being held beyond the time of   of the search, even at a time when the prime target was   was free to go about his business with a citation, and was held in these painful handcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances where, in the totality of the circumstances, she was treated much more harshly than anything this Court, I think, contemplated in the Summers case. And I think that officers know how to   officers know how to handle the Fourth Amendment issues involved in this case. They don't need a special rule because that rule would end up meaning that when you go in and you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody is still going to be subjected to this kind of serious intrusion on their individual liberty. And so we would urge the Court not to go down this new path that the United States and the petitioners are asking and to affirm the judgment because it was based on clearly established principles that this Court and other courts around the country have   have established. Thank you very much.\n Thank you, Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Phillips, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. I want to start with essentially the question that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any individual detainee. Those are rulings that I submit to you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that basis alone. At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact, proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative ground that there were 15 minutes here. The Ninth Circuit expressly never   or didn't expressly but never said one word about a period of time after the search ended in this particular case, and that's not an accident because there is no testimony. The officer said he didn't remember and when asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent with your memory, well, of course, it would. He didn't remember anything. So there's nothing in that evidence, and there's no way   I have looked at that tape. I ask you to look at that tape. I guarantee you there's no way you can draw any inference as to at what point in this process she was released vis-a-vis the end of this particular   this particular search being executed.\n So   so do we have the tape here?\n I assume you have the tape. It's part of the record. It should be in the clerk's office. If you don't have it, I'd be more than happy to send you a copy. The  \n But there was no   there was no objection to that question going to the jury, was the duration unreasonable.\n Of course not, Justice Ginsburg, because the issue before the jury was whether or not the   we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a   a threat. That was  \n But the jury  \n   their theory of the case, and that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have that affirmative obligation.\n But the jury answered the   just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.\n Not of the search. Of her detention.\n Yes.\n Yes, of her detention. And that was based on the jury's determination that we had detained her beyond the period we had done the sweep.\n So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case? In other words, if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district judge that behaved   gave a proper charge, then the Ninth Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with what the district court and the jury decided.\n Well, the   the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should   we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the matter to go back at this point. And   and that is exactly what this Court does in   you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive damages cases. Juries make punitive damages determinations every day and every day courts of appeals and trial judges review those damages awards de novo because they   because the question is not just what are the historical facts   that you give deference to the jury on   but on the fundamental question of what is the rule of law that will govern the police officers in the execution of search warrants in circumstances like this. They need protection, Your Honor. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs with the potential for abuse. And with respect to Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully controlled confines of federally approved research programs.\n Well, Mr. Clement, the   I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.\n Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases. And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy did so, as well.\n Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market. You don't have that here. As I understand it, if California's law applies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use marijuana will be on any interstate market. And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states. So how do you distinguish Morrison? And how do you distinguish Lopez?\n Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana. And, of course, the Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under Schedule I into the national market.\n Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law? I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.\n Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate. And I think Congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.\n Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume   I'm not saying this is   that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had   say they made such findings. Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?\n I think you would say they were irrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because  \n But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?\n Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question   I think that in   obviously, in all of these commerce  \n Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.\n Well, in your hypothetical   and if I could turn to that   I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.\n But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other   in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v. Filburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?\n Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.\n Absolutely.\n And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.\n But that's quite a different rational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me you're not   you're not appealing to the fact that it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce cannot effectively be implemented without this law.\n Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a different regulatory regime. Here, Congress  \n But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory   you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject   substance from being sold or   in interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter   letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.\n Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market   illegal market, albeit   but market in marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So  \n But to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana.\n Well, first of all, Justice Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to  \n Then I'm assuming   my hypothetical is that California could pass a law that would prevent diversions from occurring.\n Well, in the same way that the Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.\n But just  \n I suppose some   one answer to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.\n Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy. And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though it was focused on what was going to be an   both in that case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the entire class of activities. And if I could  \n But, as Justice O'Connor brought out earlier, all those cases   Wickard, Perez   they all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here, we're told this is different, because nobody is buying anything, nobody is selling anything.\n Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce to activity that the Court described as economic, but not commercial. And I think the production and distribution and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.\n But you're   no, I was going to   your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply   simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it. You're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.\n That's exactly right, Justice Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz and Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in particular, only because it, too, involves a non-commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of  \n Well, I do take issue with that. As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a small farmer. A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market. It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market. He used some of it himself, but part of it was commercial. I think Wickard can be distinguished on the facts.\n Well, Justice O'Connor, it could be   I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was   it was only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm. And  \n The other portion is a matter of [inaudible] interstate commerce.\n Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside   to one side all of the grain that was going to go in interstate commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents. This case is only interesting, he said, because it involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm. And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be consumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the record of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue there. And it's important to recognize that the way the Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it applied to the wheat that was used by the family for consumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation. And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not, is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause  \n And is  \n   authority.\n   this a harder or easier case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?\n Well, Justice Kennedy  \n Does this make your case easier, in a sense, or  \n I think it does, Justice Kennedy, because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit something in interstate commerce entirely, and has exercised that power, so it treats something as effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then takes the complementary step, especially in light of the fungibility of the product, and says, \"We're just going to treat this as contraband simpliciter.\" I think that judgement by Congress has a very definite link to interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to regulate interstate commerce. And I do think there's a sense in which when Congress is regulating the price of something, there's certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small producers and for Congress to say, \"Well, we can still have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority of production.\" But with respect to something that's unlawful to have and is   and has very significant risks precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime. It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal in promoting health. And I think the clearest example of that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been available as a Schedule III substance, called  \n But there's  \n   Marinol.\n   but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked. This was the only one that would. And it   Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. But let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a federal prosecution?\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland Cannabis case   and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion   I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available. But I think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled Substances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue. I think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under California law, is that there's a mismatch between what California law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce. Because the California law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines. And so, if Respondents are right on their Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right because their conduct is lawful under state law or because their   that marijuana use is medical. If they're right, then I think their analysis would extend to recreational use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and would extend to every state in the nation, not just  \n Well, I think  \n   those states that made it lawful.\n Doesn't it depend on how you define the \"relevant class of activities\"? Is it the entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular very narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible to define the class narrowly to escape a   the broad argument that you make?\n Well, I don't think that is permissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard  \n So you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.\n Under the Commerce Clause, I   that's exactly right, that would be our position. It is constitutional on its face, and it   and because of that line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of the statute as a whole  \n But, in Morrison, did the Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify Commerce Cause   Clause legislation by using a long but- for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce? I mean, the Court certainly made that statement.\n Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, but  \n Which cuts against what you're saying.\n Well, with respect, I don't think so. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize   thought it very important to emphasize two things: one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second, the Court also made it clear that the regulation that there   there was not essential to the effectiveness of an overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both points, this case is on the constitutional side of the line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.\n The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use   growing for personal use, under prescription  \n I understand that   I understand that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is not also covered. You're talking about  \n Involved economic activity.\n I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic activity. Because what you're talking about here is the possession, the manufacture, the distribution of a valuable commodity for which there is a ready   unfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.\n If we rule for the Respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in California?\n I would be speculating, Justice Kennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think that what   and that, in a sense, is consistent with the government's position, which is to say, when the government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to prohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition actually would force the price up. And there is a sense in which this regulation, although not primarily designed as a price regulation   the Controlled Substance Act, I think, does have the effect of increasing the price for marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the   and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's all consistent with Congress' judgement here. And if I could return for a second to the point about Marinol, what's important there is that the process of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful component, does two things. One, the manufacturing process allows there to be a safe use for one of the components in marijuana. But it also provides an unambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce Clause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to get people to use more healthful substances, and not use things like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is undermined if Congress can't also address that which is more harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable of being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude marijuana is.\n In other words, the statute is   it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.\n Well, I think, in responding to that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government treats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a particular patient; but that's something that this Court, I think, has previously understood, that the federal regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or doctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.\n Right.\n I think that's the import of the Rutherford decision with Laetrile.\n Do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no acceptable medical use? Say they had a   say there was a judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. Would we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the congressional finding or the judicial finding if that happened?\n Well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind. I think the   the judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance without a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a situation in   and your hypothetical might respond to a different statute that raised a harder question, where Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for changing realities. But, here, Congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III. And I think it's wrong to assume that there's any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect of making it easier to prescribe and more available. But I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe medicine  \n Have there  \n   available to patients  \n   have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the FDA?\n There have been a number of those petitions that have been filed. There was one recently rejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999. There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-iteration effort to change the rescheduling that culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s. So there's definitely been these efforts. But on the current state of the   of the record, there just is not a justification for changing the schedule. And I think both of the briefs talked a little bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the medical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for the individual components in marijuana, that smoked   smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as medicine, because   and that's true, I think, for two reasons. One, there's something like 400 different chemical components in crude marijuana that one would smoke, and it's   it just, sort of, belies any logic that all 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude material that somebody could grow in their garden, and actually have people who do this for a living get involved in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial components, and then manufacturing and making that available. The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery device for medicine, I think, is also something that really doesn't have any future as medicine. What does have a future for medicine, of course, is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial component. That's been done with Marinol. It is true that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form that Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing research to try to figure out different ways to deliver that substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of a   and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that there's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it takes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of the substance and the time that it has an effect on the system.\n May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about   it was, sort of, a categoric point   you, in effect, said, \"If this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them.\" Wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them? That in deciding what class you are going to   or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question, \"What good reasons are there to define a subclass this way?\" In this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits   whether you accept the evidence is another thing   but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug. There's no such argument, I would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category. And, for that reason, isn't there a   isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?\n With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' judgement about defining a class of activities  \n That may   oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're   you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage. And I'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-Congress argument.\n Well, Justice Souter, I have no doubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would find it very difficult to police that line over the broad variety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby. With that, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.\n Mr. Barnett.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I have two points to make. First, the class of activities involved in this case are non-economic and wholly intrastate. Second, the federal prohibition of this class of activities it not essential   is not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. If you accept the government's contrary contentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v. Raich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity.\n Well, on your first point, can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that simple possession of that commodity is a form of participation in the market?\n It can be, or it might not be. If you possess an item that came from the market or is going to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of the marketplace. But if you're in possession of an item that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the market   it didn't come from the market and it's not going to the market  \n Well, but it's fungible.\n That   the fungibility issue is in this case, but the   but a   the fact that a good is fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not make the possession of that good an economic activity. Or  \n Well, you know, Congress has applied this theory in other contexts. One is the protection of endangered species. Congress has made it unlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, the mere possession of it, whether you got it through interstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is, \"We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, period.\" Now, are those   are those laws, likewise, unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce power?\n Not if they're an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, unless those activities are reached.\n Well, why is that different from this?\n Because this class of activities   because it's been isolated by the State of California, and is policed by the State of California, so that it's entirely separated from the market  \n Isolated and   I understand that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the medical use of all of the members of the communes.\n That class of activities is not before the Court. That is actually before  \n No, but it's before the Court when you   when you raise the policing of the problem by California, and saying it's not a   it's not a real problem, you brought it before the Court.\n But that class of activities could be   could be   if this Court limits its ruling to the class of activities that is before the Court, that class  \n Which is   which is what?\n Which is  \n An individual grower?\n An individual who is growing it for her   him- or herself, who has   or has a caregiver growing it for her  \n Gee, what basis  \n   for  \n   what basis is there to draw it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we   we could say people whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that would narrow the category, too. But why does   why does that make any sense?\n Justice Scalia, we believe it makes sense because we are talking about a classification of activities that has been identified by the State of California, and which is rational to distinguish from  \n Oh, but California hasn't identified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far as California law is concerned.\n Well, it's not entirely clear whether communes are okay, as far as the California laws are concerned.\n Why wouldn't it be?\n Because if, in fact, commercial activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking place  \n No, no, they're not buying and selling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and selling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with alleged medical needs.\n I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for   an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other   now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X. But if the state says something about the X, then Congress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me to accept, because I don't see   whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and I can't find any support at all for that in any case.\n The support would come from the exception to Lopez and Morrison that the government is urging that the Court adopt, that the Congress can reach non-economic activity that's intrastate, that's wholly intrastate, if doing so is essential to a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut if they can't reach it.\n Well, here, they say   look, I take it you're using this because I was going to ask you. You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect Boston. You know, we can   oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally. You know, I can multiply the examples  \n Well  \n   and you can, too. So you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?\n By saying that it's all going to depend on the regulatory scheme, what the  \n Yeah.\n   purpose of the  \n So now what you're saying is, in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this. That's a task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in my question. [Laughter.]\n But I see it very well. Here is what they say. They say that, \"By the way, a hundred-thousand people using medical marijuana in California will lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And, second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we won't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is medical.' Certificates will circulate on the black market. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does have an impact,\" they say. Now, what's your response?\n Well, you've raised at least two different practical issues. One is the fact   the number of people who are in the class, and the second is the ability to identify whether they properly belong in the class. As for the number of people, we are talking about a very small number of people. They say a hundred-thousand. They get their figures from the National Organization from Reform of Marijuana Laws. Our figures in our brief come from the government. The figures show it's a very small fraction of persons that would be involved. And their argument is basically   and the logic of your hypothetical is premised on   the more people that go into the illicit market, the better for federal drug policy, because that will drive the price up. You have to   what we're take   we're doing is, we're taking people out of the illicit drug market, which then, under your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction   and Justice Kennedy's suggestion   would lead to a reduction in the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite would be, they're   it's good for federal policy to have more people in the illicit drug market, because that's going to drive the price up.\n No, no, we don't want more people  \n Of course not.\n   in the illicit drug market. [Laughter.]\n Of course not.\n And we don't want low prices, either. [Laughter.]\n But the   but the   but the scheme of   but the class of activities that have been authorized by the State of California will take people out of  \n So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to   the way that   you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress. That's what we'd normally say.\n Well  \n And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.\n Well, within this exception   the threshold issue   I do want to make sure that I focus on this   the threshold issue, which is the issue that has occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity here is economic or non-economic. The government claims it's economic, we claim it's non-economic.\n Well, what it is, is, it's non-economic, and it affects the economic.\n Right. So the threshold issue that is   that   upon which Lopez and Morrison terms   turns is whether it's economic or non-economic.\n Well, I should have thought that regular household chores of   say, performed in an earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic   washing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing marijuana isn't?\n If you accept the government's definition of economic, then every   then washing dishes, today, would be economic, and that  \n No, but even  \n   would be within the   within the power of Congress to reach.\n But even if we accept your definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis upon which we ought to make a category decision. You say it's non-economic because one of these people is a   is a self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for nothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given, or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe that, out of   now I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, a hundred-thousand potential users   everybody is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the backyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're going to get it on the street. And once they get it, under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it and use it. But they're going to get it in the street. Why isn't that the sensible assumption?\n Well, they have an   they have a very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because getting it on the street is going to subject them to criminal prosecution, under both California and federal law, as well as the  \n Yeah, but the   it's also the case that approximately 10 percent of the American population is doing that every day, if I accept the figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting prosecuted.\n But we're talking   in that case, we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for recreation. We are talking about a class of people here who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate the law.\n And if I am a sick person, I'm going to say, \"Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, either.\" I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, it seems to me, to avoid the street market.\n The government, in their brief, asserts that the   that the possession statute that currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why they   which is their explanation for why they failed to enforce the possession statute that they say is so essential to the  \n If one  \n   regulatory scheme.\n   if one takes your view, that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state, somebody whose doctor says, \"This person needs marijuana to live,\" but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use Act   it's just as isolated   no purchase, no sale, grown at home, good friend grows it   and yet you say Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief properly.\n Yes, Your   yes, Your Honor, because there's the   that's the second step of the analysis. The first step of the analysis is the economic/non-economic. If you don't   if the Court stops there, then they could also apply in these other states. But then if the Court adopts  \n But if you   if you buy that   so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument, it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate medical use anywhere.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n All right. Now you're going to have some limiting  \n But a limiting principle is the one that I   was identified by the Court in Lopez in which the government is asserting that if it's an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached. And the difference between states in which there is a state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use, is completely different from a practical enforcement standpoint than a state in which there is no differentiation. Just think of the existence, for example, of identification cards, which the State of California is going to be issuing, like driver's license cards.\n Yeah, but it doesn't right now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your view.\n Well, because   but this is the sort of regulation   the sort of effectiveness of the regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact   I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting the State of California to be able to administer its regime. There is no regime in other states to trust, and, therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which the states are not attempting to pursue the health of their citizens   the goal of preserving the health of their citizens this way, that would fall under the exception which this Court suggested in Lopez  \n This is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things that interests me   I guess, on your framework, Lopez should have come out my way. [Laughter.]\n Well  \n It's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.\n Justice Breyer, that's the reason why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it doesn't reach your result. [Laughter.]\n If that exception were treated as broadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent in Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will swallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited to their facts.\n I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to   what I had to say in Lopez to   was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business. So I would have thought, given the   and I believe that, you know   but, I mean   but that was far further than this, which is just direct.\n But this case is completely unlike those cases. This case is completely isolated. In Lopez, that gun probably did come through interstate commerce, not that I believe it should have made any difference, but it probably did. Here, we're talking about substances that don't. So there's just no literal connection between this class of activities and this interstate market.\n Well, we didn't decide that, in Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce. If the statute in question had applied only to guns that had been transported in interstate commerce, the case might have come out differently.\n I   no doubt, Your   I   and I wasn't suggesting otherwise, Justice Scalia. I'm just suggesting that, here, we have   exactly, that if there had been that interstate connection in Lopez, the case might have come out different. There is no interstate connection whatsoever in this class of cases. None. The only way to make it an interstate connection is through some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in which somebody who's doing something over here is going to have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over there. There is no connection.\n Sounds like Wickard to me.\n Well, Wickard, Your Honor  \n I always used to laugh at Wickard, but that's   that's what Wickard said.\n Wickard  \n Had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce.\n Had that case been about eating wheat, that case would never have arisen.\n Well, that's what it was about, as far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure, there were a lot of   there was a lot more use of the wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but it seems to me the analysis of the case said, \"You take it   you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it yourself, you make it unnecessary for your   to buy it in interstate commerce.\"\n It's   the entire analysis   the entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the farms. And by \"home-consumed,\" it did not mean eating at the family   at the family table; it meant feeding to your livestock and then putting it   your livestock  \n Strange phrase, to mean \"feeding to livestock\"?\n But the  \n \"Home-consumed\" is feed it to your pig?\n But, yes, that's exactly what  \n I don't think so.\n   that's exactly what that general term   how that general term was used in this case.\n But what the Court said, I take it   and I have quoted a lot of the language there   it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in   quote, \"though it may not be regarded as commerce\"  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n   end quote, still can be regulated, quote, \"whatever its nature,\" so long as, quote, \"it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\" Now, that's the language, and I take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.\n With all respect  \n Which is not commerce. Sorry, not commerce.\n With all respect, what   that's   I was about to make that  \n Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce.\n Right. Right. What the Court was using here was the narrower   the traditional definition of \"commerce\" that Justice Thomas has been urging this Court to adopt. And they were saying that, \"We are not going to limit ourselves to that narrow definition of 'commerce.'\" It would include, for example, agriculture and production. That's all going to be reachable, even though it's not commerce, in the traditional sense. But what we would call it today, and I believe what the Court correctly called it, in Lopez, was \"economic activity.\" Production is economic activity. Manufacturing is economic activity. But   it's not commerce, but it's economic activity that can be reached. And that is the activity   that's not only the activity that Farmer Filburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the statute was aimed at. The statute  \n Well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic activity.\n What made it an economic activity in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial enterprise, that it was being used on the farm   not in interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise of the farm.\n Again, I don't think that's   that faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think the opinion covered   including the amount that he consumed himself, and his family consumed.\n The   look, I   for whatever it's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute exempted small commercial farms. People who had backyard gardens weren't even included within the regulatory regime. The regulatory regime was about regulating or stopping or restricting the supply of wheat that got into the market, or that could have  \n Did the opinion make a point of that?\n Pardon me?\n Did the opinion make a point of that?\n It   it was mentioned in the opinion. It was not   it was not a major point of this opinion. But  \n I don't think it was a point of the Court's analysis at all.\n This  \n Could I   could I  \n Could I ask this question. What is your view with respect to the impact of the activities concerned in this case on the interstate market for marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no impact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or decrease the interstate demand? So there are three alternatives. Which is the one we should follow?\n Can I pick \"trivial impact\"? [Laughter.]\n No, but if it   \"trivial impact,\" is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?\n The only effect it could have on the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users from the illicit drug market. And to the extent that they are now in the illicit drug market   and we don't know whether they are or not  \n Well, that would reduce demand and increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way around.\n Well, it would reduce demand and reduce prices, I think. But  \n If you reduce demand, you reduce prices? Are you sure?\n Yes. [Laughter.]\n Oh, you're right. You're right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\n Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes   your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved   if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market. So the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved. You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. Let me ask you a question that would   that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how many people there are in California who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?\n I do not know the answer to that.\n Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?\n It could be, Your Honor, but that also illustrates  \n But if you   if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?\n But whatever   I don't know, because I don't know the number of people using chemotherapy. But whatever the number  \n How many people are there in California? What's the population?\n Thirty-four million.\n Thank you, Justice Kennedy.\n Lots   lots   [Laughter.]\n   lots and lots. They   a hundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy does not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact, if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is enforceable, or not. And the reason   there is reason to assume that   if we ruled your way, that that number would go up. So, if you accept that line of argument, then your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I missing something?\n Well, two things. First of all, whatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people who are sick, who are sick enough to use this. That is not an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example, recreational activity is, where lots of people could just decide to do it. We're talking about people who qualify, on a physician's recommendation, for this particular activity. That will limit the number. But the amount of the people   the effect on commerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn aggregation principle applies to the class of activities in this case, and it does not apply to the class of activities in this case if they are non-economic, as we assert that they are.\n Well   but that is circular reasoning, because the whole   your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are   the numbers are so few   the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-economic.\n Lopez and Morrison stand for the proposition that activities that simply have an effect on the market are not necessary   that does not make them economic. This Court rejected that proposition, that just because an activity has an effect   an economic effect makes the activity, itself, economic. It adopted a principle that's less than  \n Remote, remote, remote economic effect.\n It was inference upon inference upon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.\n But just   just have it   just   whether an activity is economic, you have to look to the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the production of things for sale and exchange, barter. This whole Court's jurisprudence since The New Deal has been premised on the ability to tell the difference between economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty, on the other.\n But your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their   in their supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic premise on which to base constitutional law.\n The premise of our   the premise of our economic claim is the nature of the activity involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of activity it is. The idea   for example, you   prostitution is an economic activity. Marital relations is not an economic activity. We could be talking about virtually the same act. And there is a market overhang for   from private sexual relations to prostitution, but we don't say that because there is a market for prostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in that market is economic. We look at the activities, and we  \n I'd like to ask you one question about the activity  \n Yes.\n   which was brought up before, and I just   I've never understood this. I'm not an expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not. I really don't know. So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, \"FDA, take this off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety.\" The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right into court and say, \"That's an abuse of discretion.\" The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use. So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.\n Well  \n So that's   I just want to know why.\n Well, Your Honor, first of all, that whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of Congress is to reach this activity  \n That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?\n I would  \n If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it.\n   I would simply ask Your Honor to read the amicus brief by Rick Doblin, in which it describes the government's obstruction of scientific research that would establish the safety and efficacy of cannabis by denying supplies of cannabis   of medical   of cannabis for medical experimentation. And then I'd ask Your Honor to read the Institute for Medicine's report, that both the government and I   and we have relied upon in our briefs. There has been no impeachment of this report by the National Academy of Sciences on the medical effect. And what they say is that the   that what information we have is that cannabis does have a substantial medical effect. Smoked cannabis does carry with it harms associated with it, as the   as General Clement correctly pointed out. It does carry with it these ancillary harms. But when people are sick and people are suffering and people are dying, they may be willing to run the risk of these long-term harms in order to get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that cannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. I'd just ask Your Honor to look at that, which is in the record.\n Are prescriptions, under California law, limited only to those people with life-threatening illnesses?\n They are limited to a list of illnesses that are in the statute.\n Some of the illnesses  \n Some of which are life-threatening and some of which are not, Your Honor.\n In one   in one plaintiff's case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening  \n That's correct, Your Honor. She has   she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be controlled by conventional medicines. She's a law-abiding citizen. This goes back to the issue of what the   incentives there are that are created by this. This is a law-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the illicit-drugs market.\n May I just ask you one procedural question?\n Yes.\n And this is   this is a suit for an injunction. And it   basically an injunction against a criminal prosecution.\n And seizure  \n And  \n   of these plants.\n   and there's an old saying, in equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions. So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old saying meant that you have to make your defense in the criminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?\n Well, it is   it is an   we're seeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the statute against these two persons, which includes forfeiture, which has already happened in this case. We've already had Diane Monson's plants seized by the Drug Enforcement Authority. That is not something that we   that we   that has anything to do with criminal prosecution, and yet that puts at risk her supply of medicine, the supply of medicine she needs to get by, to relieve her suffering. I see my time is up. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Barnett. General Clement, you have four minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As I understand Respondents' position, it's effectively that their clients, and clients like them, in their use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically sealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it has no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on the government's overall regulatory regime. And I understand that to be true largely because of state law. And one of the many problems with that mode of analysis is that the state law is not designed only to carve out those transactions that have no effect on interstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory regime. Proposition 215 was not passed as an exercise in cooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make medical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it in interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the marijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether you bought it, whether you grew it yourself. There's a fundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I think, undermines their theory. Now, there's the question now about what kind of impact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme. Now, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from one of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's a hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical users, if their position prevails. Now, obviously, this is all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation, so the numbers may be a bit off. But they suggest that our own government numbers are somehow better, and they cite them on page 18 of the red brief. But the only numbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in the four counties for which there are data, there was   .5 percent of the people use marijuana. Now, if you extend that out statewide to the 34 million people in California, that gives you 170,000 people. So their numbers   using the government numbers actually give you more potentially affected people. I think in trying to figure out how many people would be affected, it's worth considering what medical conditions are covered. And this responds to Justice Kennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or people with terminal cancer? And it's not. And if you want to look at what is covered as a serious medical condition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of the red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it suggests that a serious medical condition   there's a catchall at the end that includes subsection 12   \"Any other chronic or persistent medical system that, if not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety or physical or mental health.\" Now, I think that is an exceedingly broad definition of a serious medical condition for which somebody could be   get a recommendation for marijuana for medical uses. Another point worth considering, in considering the impact on the federal regulatory regime or the effectiveness of California in preventing any diversion, is to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief. One is the People against Wright. There's somebody who's arrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana. They're packaged such that he has one small bag in his pocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his backpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then a pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck. And yet the Appellate Court in California said that he was entitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was for medical use. The fact that he had a scale, and the fact that it was packaged the way it was, could be explained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and that he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off. I think that shows that it's going to be very hard to enforce the regulatory regime. The other case in the reply brief worth mentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case where a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said that it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled Substances Act against a 250-person cooperative. And that just shows that this is not something that will be limited to one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial impact on the government's ability to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Thank you.\n Thank you, General Clement. The case is submitted.\n Good morning. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The injunction in this case violates the most basic principles of the First Amendment. It's a prior restraint. It's a content-based restriction on speech. It's vastly overbroad. It even restricts the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as Petitioner Ruth Craft. The injunction in this case is inconsistent with this country's unique and profound commitment that speech by public officials and public figures be open, robust, and uninhibited. One way in which the injunction is clearly unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit. For example, Ruth Craft is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party to the lawsuit. And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the lawsuit.\n How about you? You're in trouble too, aren't you? (Laughter.)\n Yes, I am, Your Honor. This injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I could be held in contempt of court.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts. I thought that you were not challenging   at least the question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging   the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?\n No, Your Honor. The question presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional. One of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment. All of the statements that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the First Amendment. There is not the requisite actual malice. And so it's our position that the injunction itself is unconstitutional.\n But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.\n Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. It's our position, though, that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of speech.\n But that isn't what you've said in the question presented. Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented? And that would leave the other parts there.\n Well, of course, you're limited to the question presented. Our position, though, is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is unconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by the First Amendment.\n Yes, but you understand Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would affect the first and third parts.\n Well, Your Honor, certainly we believe that the injunction is most clearly unconstitutional in its overbreadth. We believe also and separately the injunction is unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public officials and public figures. But it's also our position that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First Amendment.\n Well, but that doesn't  \n Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?\n No, Your Honor. We don't believe our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran. We believe that all of his speech is just opinion.\n Does he intend to continue making the same comments that he made before?\n His exact words were that perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr. Cochran owes him money.\n All right. Now, let me ask you this. Under your theory, if   if the defendant is judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if the statements are defamatory?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n What is it?\n There is, of course, a remedy. Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There is a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your Honor, there can't be a different rule  \n But if   if the defendant is judgment-proof, what good does that do?\n Your Honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are poor will have injunctions  \n Well   well, your   your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case.\n No, Your Honor, I disagree with that.\n I mean, you   you say he has the remedy of   of counter-speech. We're talking   that's really that doesn't answer the question. The question is, is there anything he can get from the courts other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.\n That's correct, Your Honor. From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a person may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd be collected for the person who gets assets in the future. Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it can't be  \n Well, it   it seems to me that that really avoids the problem   the problem. So suppose we disagree with you about that. Then it's true that there is no   there is no legal remedy that he can get.\n But then, Justice Kennedy, it can't be the rule that poor people have their speech enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in the future.\n Well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and   and people who have money cannot. I mean, that's   that's not a fair rule either.\n No, Your Honor, but that's why there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue a damage judgment. There are many instances in which damage judgments can't be collected.\n It's worthless against a   against a person who has no assets.\n But that's true everywhere in the legal system, Your Honor. And I would also argue here that none of Mr. Tory's statements were defamatory. I would point  \n Now that's another one that is in your brief. You say that these were statements of opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in your question. You   you don't   there were findings made that these statements were defamatory, and your question presented does not seem to me to encompass at all the question whether these statements were defamatory.\n I would disagree, Your Honor. The question presented is whether this injunction, that forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One reason why  \n Not   not this injunction. The question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation   in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation. I   I just don't think it's fairly included within the question.\n Your Honor, what I am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech  \n No, it doesn't. It says whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure violates the First Amendment.\n We would argue  \n There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation. There's nothing in there about that.\n Your Honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And our position is that all of the speech that was expressed in this case is opinion. And it's important  \n All right. Now, if that's so  \n Well   well, there really   there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I   I think we should just proceed on   on some other basis for this argument. We have other questions to discuss.\n Sure. But, Your Honor, I want to just respond to that. The exact statement there was   and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the joint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief. Can a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion. In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling somebody a traitor is opinion.\n All right. That   that   what you've quoted many   much of this I wouldn't repeat in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for   for desisting from that type of activity. All right. Now, those are the findings against you. So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in   with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind. And I want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?\n I would suggest three different ways in which you could write the opinion that distinguished the case. The first is that this injunction is vastly overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the First Amendment. A second way of distinguishing is that defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not permitted in defamation actions. That's quite different than a harassment action. And third, as I've argued, what makes this different is the basis for this injunction is speech protected by the First Amendment. With regard to the findings that you referred to, you mentioned two. The first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor, the only privacy claim in this case was false light invasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when it's based on the same fact. The second basis you pointed  \n Mr. Chemerinsky, this case comes up to us from a California appellate court. Surely they know California law better than we do.\n Yes, Your Honor, but they did not base their decision on the privacy claim because California law is clear that when it's false light invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation action, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School District.\n Well, we're not going to debate among ourselves over what California law is.\n No, Your Honor. All I'm saying is it's important to be clear about what the privacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer, there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions. Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not the privacy claim in this case which was just about false light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted is treated together with defamation.\n Suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house.\n Your Honor, under Frisby v. Schultz, that would be a different situation. Under Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said  \n All right. Well   well, then this   this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the sky is falling and so forth, I   I think we have to be more precise here. I think if it were in front of his house, it would be different. If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages, it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least   I don't know California law   says that you   would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel  \n Well, Your Honor  \n   that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a   of a business?\n Actually, Your Honor, the vast majority of cases have held that you cannot have an injunction for product defamation. And so I think while that's a different and more difficult question, most courts have said no even there. And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never be injunctions. But I am saying that this Court has said there's a very strong and heavy presumption against injunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year history of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld an injunction as a remedy in a defamation action. And, Your Honor  \n Well, if   if this under   the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this   this   your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy. Is there nothing that one can do to stop another from engaging in blackmail?\n Yes, Your Honor, there is. If this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could have filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your Honor, this wasn't extortion.\n What kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction? I mean, why   why do we do this?\n But Your Honor, that's because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are even worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this Court  \n But   but why   is that true in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not sure   I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in the first area, but let's   let's assume the timid person is not sure. So he wants   he wants to get an equitable ruling first, declaratory judgment. He   and he would take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than going to jail.\n But, Your Honor, I'd remind you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader than against limits on criminal penalties.\n I know, but I'm asking you why that   why that should be. If   if you asked a person not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse, having an injunction that you can argue about or going to jail, I   I think they would say that going to jail is worse.\n But, Your Honor, in terms of the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction has always been regarded as worse.\n Always? Do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if   et cetera. I mean, how   how far do you want to push that principle?\n Your Honor, I don't want to push the principle at all to harassment. I believe that injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment actions. I think it is quite important to note that the California harassment statute expressly excludes speech which is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis for harassment. The history of the First Amendment is different. To go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed out  \n Why can't we say that speech that is   is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different? And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not all speech, but only when speech is being used to   to extort money.\n Yes, Your Honor, there can be an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion. There was never the criminal complaint. There was never the civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for extortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section 518, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of property from another with his consent induced by a wrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful use of force or fear. Now, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking  \n Here I think there was   why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that   of that happening?\n Your Honor, this Court is required to do an independent review of the record under Bose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr. Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside. It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage Mr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its protective character simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, the district   I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money   a monetary settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And those sound like findings. It's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the   that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.\n But, Your Honor, since this is a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules under the First Amendment for defamation have to apply. Under the rules of the First Amendment for defamation, injunctions are not available to public officials or public figures.\n Well, so this finding   the court shouldn't have made these findings? It was irrelevant?\n Well, Your Honor, I believe that the  \n Was there an objection to the testimony that established this?\n Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory, who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very outset objected that he was being held liable for speech protected by the First Amendment.\n No, but it seems to me   and I think what bothers me is   is what bothers Justice Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten   that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems to me, is   is something that we   we are not here to touch. That's a question of California law. What we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here   that we have a question about the   the breadth of the case we took. But maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities. But I   I think we're not here to decide whether California could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you agree with that?\n No, Your Honor. I certainly agree with the first point. One issue before this Court is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and whose regulated. But as to the second point that you make, this is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public figure.\n Well, it can certainly   the   the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has   has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question. We may   I'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the   the State of   the courts of California should have reached extortion.\n I would disagree in this way, Your Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate court has to do an independent review of the record.\n With respect to the defamation, pure and simple. I agree with you. We   there is a heightened standard of review, but I don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the State courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.\n But, Your Honor, it was not treated here as an action for extortion or harassment  \n I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does not have a civil action for extortion. It provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that State at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?\n Your Honor, I would say the history of the First Amendment is different. A State can create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any defamation case, somebody might plead something about extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be the norm.\n May I ask this   may I ask this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's office?\n No, Your Honor, because the law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy in defamation cases.\n What's the best authority you have for that proposition?\n Near v. Minnesota would be the best authority where this Court said clearly that injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation case.\n Add to Justice Stevens'   add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.\n But, Your Honor, even   yes, Your Honor. But I don't think that changes the hypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.\n Would you add too that he's judgment-proof?\n Well, again, as I said to Justice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that we allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy people.\n You're saying   you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.\n Well, Your Honor, there are other causes of action that may allow that. If it could be  \n So I'm   my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?\n Not in a defamation action, Your Honor.\n That's  \n I  \n   that's not the question.\n But what is your authority for that proposition?\n Well, I would say that the authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has this Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.\n Have we ever set aside an injunction that did that?\n Well, not under those facts.\n Have we done it either way?\n No. That's correct, Your Honor.\n Have we ever   have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?\n I would say yes, extortion for Austin v. Keith. There was speech to pressure, and yet this Court said even though the speech was to pressure, it's still protected by the First Amendment. I'd like to save the rest of the time for rebuttal, if that's permissible.\n Very well, Mr. Chemerinsky.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court: For years, Mr. Tory has relentlessly targeted Johnnie Cochran with a pattern of defamatory speech in a public forum for purpose of causing Mr. Cochran to pay Mr. Tory money in tribute for ceasing from this unprotected activity. He admitted at trial he intended to engage in this conduct. He was doing it just so he could be paid money, and when asked if he would continue to do so, he stated he would.\n Well, do you   do you defend the injunction in its entirety?\n Yes  \n In other words, the   the   Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to   to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was   quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time. With respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?\n Yes. First of all, I don't believe it was directed to a lot of people. As this  \n Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of   of the named party. So, I   I assume that Mr. Cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.\n I believe this Court said in Madsen that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr. Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for other persons who are not before the court. No aider or abetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms. Craft has never been served with this injunction. Only Mr. Tory. So I don't believe  \n Well, let me ask you a law school question. In   given the injunction on its face, with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to speech in a public place?\n I defend the injunction, and respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is conduct that was being enjoined  \n I   I asked you  \n   from the use of unprotected speech.\n   to exclude the   the issue of conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the injunction that enjoins speech by these people, associates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of the injunction for all time, do you defend that injunction?\n Yes, we defend the injunction.\n Let's take specifically the words of the injunction. It's against orally uttering statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements about Cochran.\n Yes.\n You say that someone can be enjoined  \n Based upon the unique facts of this case, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined. I don't say that in the abstract.\n Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all. I   I mean, the   the injunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of being overly broad.\n But in Near, they set forth certain factors, and those factors included that it was not a private redress of private wrongs. The information was of legitimate public concern. Neither of those elements are present in this action.\n You don't know that.\n You don't  \n You don't know what future speech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know, Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San Francisco. That would be a   a question of public concern.\n But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern of continuing, repetitive conduct.\n Well, what   what you're saying is that an   an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no authority for that proposition.\n I'm not suggesting that this injunction is necessarily overboard based upon that proposition because I believe there are  \n But we have just pointed out that it   that it   it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.\n I disagree with that, Justice Kennedy.\n Well, it does on its face. I mean, it is clearly overbroad. Now, what should we do about that?\n Well, if you're asking me, based upon the breadth of the injunction, what I   if   if there was   are you asking me what I would do to modify the injunction? You could merely strike   you could leave intact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections (ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.\n Now, let   let me ask you about that. Let's   let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the Court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute where we have to save the statute. Do we have any obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why   why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?\n Yes. In   in Madsen, Justice Kennedy, you struck   the Court struck certain provisions as being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain intact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this injunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1. The   they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack paragraph 3. They only level their attack at paragraph 2, and paragraph 2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii), would then be limited to the exact conduct in issue, which is picketing.\n So   so if   before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran. All right. That's what it says. Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart, Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television   do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?\n Absolutely not.\n Absolutely not. Because? Because?\n First of all, that's  \n It said the words. They violated the words. It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?\n Because I don't believe that's a public forum.\n Oh, no, no. He does it in a public forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall. (Laughter.)\n And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a public forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?\n Your   Your Honor, I believe there are alternative channels of communication here.\n No. I thought what you were going to say   but you're not. So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.\n Well, I was  \n But, now, you haven't said that. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it. (Laughter.)\n I think I said it when I said there was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under Pittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct that he has engaged in. And that was clearly the purpose of this injunction, Justice Breyer. We know that. And the purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran.\n In more than one case, we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear and not leaving things to the imagination.\n Well, I think this is precise and clear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's very clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive conduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him  \n Well, it's   it's  \n But nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.\n That's right. It's  \n The injunction just speaks for itself. It doesn't say what   doing what you used to do or anything like that.\n The injunction  \n You cannot picket Cochran or Cochran's law firm. Period.\n If we restricted the injunction to specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief, the response will be that he'll come up with five new words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting  \n Well, maybe there are different grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways to draft it that say no picketing. Period.\n Well, there could be no picketing for purposes of   no   which contains defamatory speech for purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But  \n All I'm suggesting is just draft it   just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely. Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.\n Well, I would disagree based upon the prior   continuing course of   of repetitive conduct and the fact that this   over a period 3 years, once a week, this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr. Cochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles Superior Court. And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a public figure actually favors the breadth of this injunction. If this was not a public figure, then the public forum issue would not be as effective. But because Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets protection is in the public forum because this gentleman could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And that is the problem we were contending with in attempting to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet could control Mr. Tory  \n You   you did draft this injunction. It wasn't the   an inspiration from the judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?\n It  \n This   the terms of this injunction.\n Were aided   were aided by my advocacy, Your Honor.\n Aided and abetted.\n Well said, Justice Rehnquist. What I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran would have been faced with   he has no remedy. Injunctive relief is the only remedy. And he would be faced with a multiplicity of actions  \n Why? Why couldn't he just be enjoined from   from similar defamation? I mean, this   this enjoins him from   from true speech. At least he could   he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that, then   then he could be punished.\n I think we would be   that injunction then would be attacked on being vague or ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say. I guarantee you that was  \n Well, if   if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We   we shouldn't have injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.\n No. I think they can be tailored. I just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this   there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in the least restrictive means. I also continue to advance the argument that this   the facts of this case are unique. It's the use of speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This   this conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The conduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is not protected. If that is not protected, then I believe we can craft  \n You can   you can certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll shoot you. But that   this was a far cry from that. In other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and saying give me something. It's denouncing the victim, which gets into free speech here.\n It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist. But what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr. Cochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions other than to draft the injunction in a form that would preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct without regard to whether it was   and to let him know clearly   give him a safe harbor as to what he could and could not say.\n But the injunction isn't limited to the same conduct.\n But I don't think it needs to be because of the pattern and practice that this man has engaged in over 3 years. And if we take the example, which is so he has a change of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr. Cochran and that's become his   and he's going to promote him as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into the court and modify the injunction.\n I thought he lived in L.A. (Laughter.)\n I think he'd like to get him up to San Francisco. (Laughter.)\n He can certainly seek to modify the injunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent letter brief, there's   California doesn't adopt the collateral bar rule. And therefore, he has a check and balance in this case. Under People v. Gonzales, 12 Cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in the State of California. So in the unlikely event that Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one, and two, in the   in the more unlikely event that someone was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging in protected speech, he could contest, under First Amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in the State of California because the collateral bar rule has no impact.\n Well, I'm   I'm baffled by that. What you're saying is that the injunction   we're just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean anything?\n No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all I'm saying is  \n I   I fell off the track here.\n All I'm   all I'm saying is that if the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive your right to contest. You don't have a right to contest the constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be enforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt proceeding. California does not adopt that rule. Therefore, Mr. Tory can always   if he is engaged in protected speech, he can easily contend  \n Oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at   he's at risk of a contempt citation.\n I don't dispute that.\n I mean, his speech is being chilled with   with respect to protected speech.\n But there's nothing unusual  \n So the collateral bar rule doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt citation.\n He's subject to it, but there's a check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the potential remedy for Mr. Cochran   what   what is going to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs? And if we balance that against the   the breadth of this injunction, I think we have to look at   one of the biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.\n But it would be so easy. I mean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.\n That's exactly  \n And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense. It would violate the First Amendment. But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.\n And I have no dispute with that, Justice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for the injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And you could always remand for further proceedings, consistent with any opinion you would write, that the injunction has to be tailored to   to deal with defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with the intent to extort. And I  \n That's what he's arguing. You're   you're conceding that it's overbroad.\n I'm saying if this Court   well, I'm gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's overbroad.\n Ah, you're very perceptive. (Laughter.)\n And having gleaned that perception, I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on paragraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First Amendment issues. And I think it's important to point out that if we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in this day   modern age  \n You're sort of saying the opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away, has it ever been there?\n It's never been there.\n What are we taking away?\n I   I agree it's never   you've never found it there and you've never said it can't be there.\n How does California work in that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of State law boxes, that California seems to have an action. Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind. It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you have defamation accompanied by extortion   call it whatever you want   an injunction is proper in these circumstances. Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking about this beast in California which uses the word defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues   also finds extortion and therefore issues an injunction.\n Yes, I think that you could limit the injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature designed to extort.\n Would   would that make Mr. Cochran happy? What   what's the big deal about extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you think Mr. Cochran would be any   any happier simply because the guy says I'll   hasn't said I'll stop if you pay me $10,000?\n No, and I think that would be subject to the same injunctive relief. I think this case is unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree, Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I think people would start defaming with impunity.\n You've got to give us some line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto extortion is that   that there's reluctance to say you can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now, what   what limitation do you want to place upon the ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation combined with extortion?\n I don't think you need to place a limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory conduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes on of a   of a business that   a startup company. It can't   damages of   for a startup company   they're very difficult to prove.\n But then you run into the public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation action against a public figure, which they want to say this is. You can write all kinds of things about public figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do   is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation action an injunction?\n There's no authority, but there's no authority that says you can't do it. But what I am suggesting is in   is in a pure defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only way to get that posting off the Internet would be to enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the problem. And if it's   even if it's purely defamatory, you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting, similar to   to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude it. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it in the future.\n But you've just said something that I think that's inconsistent with your earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to enjoin the particular placards that were used, the particular words because then there would be other words. So the same question could come up with an Internet posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was posted but anything about this particular individual that might be posted in the future.\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of balancing about the   how narrowly tailored the injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and, you know   and   and in this   and what test we would analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the Ward test. And   and I think that in applying those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific type of speech or   then that   that would be a   a reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of actions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy for that posting or postings of a similar nature. So  \n Now, you   you   to the extent that you're complaining about extortion-like conduct, something else that you drafted   I'm looking at the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have identified all defamatory, including with the false light invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that looks like blackmail.\n If you'd   if I could direct you, Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of conduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the business of professionally extorting monies from innocent persons and business  \n I   I was going to ask you about that. Were there findings to substantiate the allegations?\n Findings to substantiate  \n Specifically about the extorting money from the bank and the oil company.\n No, Justice Kennedy, there were not.\n No findings.\n There was some testimony only on one of those issues, which was the oil company. There was no findings on this issue. But then I would refer you to paragraph (k) which specifically refers to extorting of monies. And also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the trial's transcript, the   the first thing I said is this is speech designed for an improper purpose. It's unprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran. That was the whole theme  \n But what   what I mean is could you have   without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not looking at your particular allegations but how you described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and invasion of privacy.\n I think we could have pled extortion had we chose to. We could have pled inference with advantageous business relations. We probably could have pled California's  \n Does California law require you to label the type of the cause of action or is it notice pleading based on facts?\n Notice pleading based on facts, but we do label the causes of action. The   the point I'm trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled, if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is not protected. And whether we named the cause of action correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money. We attempted to achieve that. We thought we did a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack and I agree is not fairly included within the question which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the underlying finding. But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr. Tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran. He   and   and this is   one point that I want to stress. We don't view this injunction as being violated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went in the newspapers. We don't view those as public forums under the definition that this Court has provided. Those are not public forums. We are not concerned about that. We do not believe that those events will occur. We did not seek to protect them. So we have given Mr. Tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day. And with that, I would submit that while the injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.\n Thank you. Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about how an opinion might be written, and there are three different ways not mutually exclusive. One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad for all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole said a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can go to court and ask for modification of the injunction, but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr. Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets permission. Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go before the media. However, under California law, under Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public forum. A second way the opinion could be written is that this for speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether that's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion claim.\n Yes, but you're asking us now to   the   the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included in the question presented.\n I think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible. But I go on to the third way that the opinion could be written, and that's that injunctions are not permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can have an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a remedy. But those have specific elements that have to be met. Those elements weren't met in this case. History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow injunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either too narrow or too broad. In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by this Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later than that. To approve an injunction in a case like this, even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in defamation cases across the country. No  \n There have been   there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking.\n Yes, Your Honor, and we have no objection to injunctions of that sort. What we object to is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case and an injunction that is directed at speech. That's what the First Amendment prohibits. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.\n", "argument in Bates against Dow AgroSciences ": " Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this Court emphasized once again that statutory interpretation is a holistic process based on common sense, that the reading of the statute should look at all the words to avoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the text does not dictate it and the statutory history suggests otherwise.\n That was a case I dissented in, wasn't it?\n Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia, I think even you will find our case more appealing.\n Yes, but   but it is true you have a strong textual  \n We have an excellent textual argument.\n I was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.\n We do. A holistic reading of the text shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code  \n What does a holistic reading mean? Can you stay within the  \n Absolutely.\n   text and still be holistic?\n I'm not going to look outside the text at all. A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, which is on   in the petitioners' brief at pages 1 through 2  \n What does the word holistic mean? (Laughter.)\n I think it means read all the words in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word artificially. For example, when you look at a phrase like on account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in North LaSalle, account means a lot of different things, but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this statute.\n So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?\n I think it'd be partial, but I'm not sure.\n Well, let   let me ask  \n Sure.\n   ask you this. The   the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the   the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.\n Yes, and I think payments are triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of retirement payments. For individuals  \n Well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty.\n Right, and that's not  \n And   and that isn't then on the basis of age. Am I right? Is that   that was the problem the court had below.\n Yes, that's the problem the court had below. I think it's an illusory problem for the following reason. It's clear that the right to receive full enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until one of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the estate, death. And that's the right that we're talking about here, and that's why  \n Well, when you say full enjoyment, you   you think when   when I'm taxed on something, I   I don't have full enjoyment of it? The only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell   the only thing triggered by age   is your obtaining of a tax benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you can withdraw it without   without paying the 10 percent tax.\n That's correct, but the 10 percent tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a deterrent and a penalty.\n Well, I'm sure it does, but   but it's   it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n Well, Justice Scalia, the way that I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a penalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because the holistic sense, the full reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled, or ill people, once they get to the point where those triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur. Those are the same triggering events  \n Ms. Karlan, the   as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are   there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One thing that I don't know and may be of some significance, did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it over?\n Northrop Grumman's policy is to require individuals who leave the company's employment to roll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried to get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they were unable to do because of their health, they could have rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely exemptible.\n Another employer's plan.\n That's correct.\n But they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?\n No. This employer did not permit individuals to keep the money in the plan. They were told they had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.\n That was a term of the plan that it   you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?\n Apparently so.\n Are there any other plans that are   are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n All right. Well, then  \n Let me give you a couple  \n   then you might persuade me.\n Let me give you a couple of examples  \n Okay.\n   that I think will be quite familiar. A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money before you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and you pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so. The Federal Government's thrift savings plan for Federal employees allows you to take a loan out of the plan and to pay the interest back into your own account before you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving you free use of the money. If you don't pay the loan back, it's then treated as a   as a distribution, and you pay the 10 percent tax penalty on it. So that if you read this statute to   not to include IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this statute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern forms of defined contribution pension plans or savings plans.\n Yes. That was what I was going   aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock bonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n I thought they were all in the same boat. So what the effect of this rule is   of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to qualify  \n Yes, that's correct. You would render section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.\n Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit. Excuse me.\n Yes. I   I can see why you might have thought it was the Ninth Circuit. (Laughter.)\n It   it might be wrong anyway. (Laughter.)\n Yes, yes.\n What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?\n Well, in the Cilek case from the Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under the penalty process.\n And the   the payment here   it says   the statute uses the word payment. So suppose you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?\n It would be because it's the right to the future payments and not just the present payments, Justice Breyer.\n So   so   but I'm trying   what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take   just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a   a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.\n That's correct, Justice Breyer. But in order to protect the ability to take money out after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a half, there won't be any money there for him to take out. And that's why the exemption extends not just to present payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the debtor. And I can't emphasize  \n Ms. Karlan, let me ask something about that very point because the statute says that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor it's allowable.\n Yes, Justice O'Connor.\n Are you aware of cases where the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all that money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that. We'll just let you deduct X amount.\n Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the yellow brief on pages 19 through   to 20, I think is where we   where we talk about  \n Can we take this concrete case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something over $42,000.\n Yes.\n What was the claim here as to   was part or all of that   it would be some $54,000.\n The claim was all that all of that was necessary. If I could give an example that I think Justice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally require turnover of the entire IRA because people have time to earn the money back again. When the debtor has other retirement savings, for example, in a case from Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a 401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire IRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of at   will also require turnover of at least part of the IRA. In this case  \n What   what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that? It seems to me  \n Well, if the client is ill now, they get to keep it  \n No, no. They   they say my client is able-bodied now, but we   we need something because   I don't know   there's a history of family illness or something.\n There isn't a reported case that talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason of exempting the money.\n It's   I'm trying to figure out how   how   what the theory is. Is   you say I have a right to receive payments because of age. And you say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is   is   stops the   the younger person getting the money. So does the case then turn on that? I mean, suppose   suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work. What's the right analysis?\n I would say at the 1 percent and 80 percent of the people are taking the money out, it wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore. But if I can give another statistic that might be helpful in thinking about this. 18 percent of the participants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age of 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.\n What percent?\n 18 percent in one of the surveys. And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt under the bankruptcy  \n Well, they're taking out loans against it. They're   they're not withdrawing the money.\n Well, but the loans because   for example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially as close to taking out the money as you can get.\n I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first. How   how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language? If the   if your clients can take the money   just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why is it on account of age?\n It   it's not the   if you look at the statute   and let me just work my way through it with you. It's the right to a payment under a stock bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account of illness. And the question is what does on account of modify there. I think the most natural and sensible reading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a plan that is because of disability, and the like.\n So you say that payment doesn't   on account of doesn't modify payment.\n I don't   I don't think you need to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading here, especially given that the statute  \n Well, I   I think the logical reading is that it   it modifies payment.\n Well, I   I'm not sure that it does, but even if it did, Your Honor  \n Holistic for me. What   what does it   what does it modify? I mean, if you had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?\n Well, this is again   I know you dissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously crafted statute.\n No. I thought I was being holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth. (Laughter.)\n Okay. Okay.\n But  \n Well  \n   but what does on account of modify?\n I think what on account of modifies here is the kind of plan out of which the payment is coming.\n Where   where is that noun?\n There are a variety of plans, stock bonus, pension  \n The right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension  \n Yes.\n   profit sharing, annuity, or similar plan or   or contract. It's a plan on account of illness, an annuity?\n Plans  \n Why   why isn't it a right on account of?\n It's the right on account of.\n Well, I think you can read it either way and you'll get to exactly the same result. So let me read it the way that you've been reading it, which is if you want to protect the ability of people who have IRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to protect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for them to exercise their right to withdraw on account of age.\n Yes, but   but there still is a right to take payments at any time.\n Justice   Justice Kennedy, we don't believe  \n So   so then you're   you're  \n   that that's actually a right.\n Under that, you're giving the   the language that follows it no meaning.\n No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's entitled to exemption.\n But as purely English   as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is that right? The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age. That's the   a plan. That's the right. Now, your argument, I take it, was   is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age. So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.\n That's correct.\n It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty. And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered? And the language doesn't answer it. So  \n But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.\n Yes.\n No.\n No, because the savings account doesn't have   I mean, the savings account doesn't have the   the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got to read the right as meaning a right without penalty, because if you don't read it that way, then every one of these other retirement instruments is likewise going to fail? Isn't that your   your strong point?\n That's your strong point.\n That's correct. That's   that's our strong point and we're sticking with it. (Laughter.)\n Right. Right   it's not a right if you have to pay a penalty for it.\n That's correct. It's not a right, as we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk because if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.\n Right.\n And I think no matter how  \n That's a good argument. I like that.\n Thank you. (Laughter.)\n No matter how you read the statute, it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not cover many of the other  \n Why didn't Congress just put in IRA's along with the other things?\n They did, Justice Ginsburg. They did in the last line of the statute.\n Yes, but that's sort of an oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put it together with the other string of plans?\n Well, my best guess as to why they didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they stuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.\n What  \n What your   what your opponents say is that the   the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until   until you reach a certain age. And if they're structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to mention 408 in the   in the exceptions. What's wrong with that argument?\n Well, what's wrong with that, Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early withdrawal. So under their theory, there has   there is not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in the United States  \n Well  \n   that had that inability to take the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a half.\n Do   do we know that? I mean, couldn't someone   I   I don't think this is a very plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want the IRA to be, in   in effect, like an irrevocable trust in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create an IRA that would be as restricted as   as the circuit suggested it might be?\n I don't necessarily think so for the following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products. They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people buy. People don't usually negotiate the terms. If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's the second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax code. You then lose the ability to deduct the contributions going in. You then lose the ability to defer the payments on the income as it accrues in the account. Now, to answer the last part of your question, one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5 to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors. Why do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's are a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.\n And some don't. And the   and the State systems vary.\n That's correct, but only four States offer no protection to IRA's from creditors as opposed to  \n As opposed to how many who do?\n 46 States offer some kind of protection. 23 States protect them without limit in bankruptcy and out. 6 of them protect them inside of bankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as the amount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor's support.\n Well, that's what   with the purpose that we're talking about now  \n That's correct.\n   if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.\n No. No. 23 of them would protect all IRA's. 6 would protect all IRA's if the money in them is necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6 more would protect all the money in an IRA as long as it was deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all IRA's up to a dollar amount. In Nevada, the dollar amount is $500,000. 8 States use, as their State exemption law, an IRA that   a statute that has exactly the same language as the Federal statute. 6 of those State statutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to protect IRA's.\n But here there was no choice of picking up on the State?\n There's a   there's a weird anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means that you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person in Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his   in his IRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than electing the State exemptions.\n And one train that we didn't finish before. You were explaining that in this case the entire $55,000   that entire sum would be needed   would be necessary for the support of the debtors.\n That's correct. The bankruptcy court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't come within the meaning of section 522.\n But you   that was your claim, and I  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n How did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?\n Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an annuity that, I would guess   you know, I   I hate to do math in my head like this. I'd guess it would throw off a couple of hundred dollars a month in additional income. And so if you ask will the Rouseys need that money for their support, I think the answer is yes because their only other support  \n Well. Oh, yes.\n   is Social Security and a $2,000 a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and against which their Social Security will be offset. So when they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about to be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan reduces their benefits. So if the Rouseys are to have an old age in which they can afford to live in any kind of reasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.\n May I go back and just nail down one lose end in   in an answer that you   you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only no statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that you can make your IRA terms more restrictive without jeopardizing your qualification.\n I was unable to find one, Your Honor.\n Okay.\n I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Why didn't the Government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an amicus brief here from the Government, do we?\n I   no, we do not have one, and I don't  \n The Government has no position on the matter.\n Well, I   I don't think they've taken a position here. I will say that in Patterson against Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in their brief, I believe, as pension plans under section 408.\n There   they never go bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against any exemption from the   (Laughter.)\n Well   well, that's correct. The United States trustee may have wanted them to   I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Ms. McKiever.\n Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment is not exempt unless two requirements are met. First, the right to receive the payment must be on account of illness, disability, death, age or length of service, and the right must come from a specified similar plan or contract. Because neither of those elements is satisfied in this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.\n Is it   is it the case that other plans that are clearly covered by the text of this statute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?\n Yes and no, and let me explain that. Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain factors. Those are enumerated based   based upon each individual plan. However, they do not permit withdrawals for any reason at any time for any purpose.\n Not a single one of them.\n Not a single one of them. Now, of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none of the plans that I have ever seen, as the specified plans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.\n And you'd say that if one of them did, it would also not be covered.\n That's correct. It   it is thought  \n What   what  \n I take it   in   in answering Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that none of the   we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as   as restricted as the language in this   this statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a   in a very literal way.\n There are  \n In other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as   as you say the   the 401   the   the IRA is.\n That   that is correct. The   there probably are plans out there   once again, there are so many plans. And those are created by financial institutions, by employers, by different entities. So therefore there are thousands of variations of those.\n Now, why? Okay. Once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you. So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of holistic. So   so the   the point that I would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as pensions   I do. I think of it that way. I don't know much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?\n This is different because this is the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at any time for any purpose. It is also  \n I know that, but   but   and you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.\n That's correct.\n But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.\n Because the right to   to receive the payment, the right to access the money at any time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it does not meet the language of the statute. The statute very specifically  \n No, no. I   you've missed my point and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my following up. I shouldn't have.\n I'm sorry. Yes.\n My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.\n Because there is no causal connection between any of the factors that are enumerated in the statute and the right to receive the money. And that is  \n I  \n May I ask this question? Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an absolute prohibition, would you agree   on getting the money before you're 59 and a half, would then that qualify?\n Absolutely, yes, it would.\n Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?\n Clearly, there's a point at which it would qualify as a prohibition more than just  \n And what is it that makes it a prohibition? Is it   is it because the purpose is to deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically unacceptable? What   what is the reason for drawing the line somewhere above 10 percent?\n The reason for drawing the line is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated in   in the Huebner case, it   it said that it's a minimal penalty. However, there is still the unfettered access that's available.\n But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?\n I would assume as a disincentive to   to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition, such as the   the parking  \n But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.\n It would not be a prohibition, but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10 percent.\n So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.\n Clearly that   it's a very difficult line to draw. I   I can't make that call at this moment, but  \n It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right. But the fact that for a   an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are   you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.\n But the   the hallmark difference here is that it   it is the only type of account that you can access paying the penalty for any reason  \n I assume  \n   regardless of the specified reason.\n   that   that your answer to Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose of the statute is to make sure that people have money for their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any reason whatever, there is no security that that money will be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the reasons to sickness and   and a certain other number of emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for the retirement are much higher.\n Well, that   that's  \n Isn't that the answer?\n But if that's the answer, excellent. So now we have   (Laughter.)\n   let's say  \n Thank you, Justice Scalia.\n Let's try   let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money. Now, would   that you would say would fall within this.\n Yes.\n Fine, yes.\n Yes.\n Okay. Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old age   why isn't that just as good as the million percent tax in a world that is imperfect?\n Because clearly the   the access of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement, just as   as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the   the debtors to   to access freely for any purpose, clearly not showing that   that it would be for retirement purposes.\n But attachment of the  \n All right, but it's acquired. Say   say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60   it's not that bad   (Laughter.)\n 93.\n If   if that is going to be your criterion, the   the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why   why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future? Because the   the question then is going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to old age to   to allow for a continued exemption and how free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA category. You told us a few moments ago   and I'm sure you   you were right   that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up. So if   if we say that the   the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans. Aren't we?\n Not necessarily. The   the line that we're really looking to is that there has to be a direct causation factor between one of the five specified factors such as on   on account of factors, age, disability, death, length of service, and the right to receive the payment.\n Well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that. I mean, you   we would just have endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what doesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to draw here.\n Well  \n And every plan that I know of allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.\n And that's typically  \n In fact, that's what happened to these people. So I just don't see how your argument is going to  \n Well, the   the ability to access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do with the length of service, the years in service because they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full percentage. They're not fully vested until that time. Also, with the   when there are multiple factors existing in the right to receive the payments, each multiple factor can be a cause of the   of the ability to reach the money. When there are no meaningful factors imposed, though  \n Isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support? I mean, that   that seems to me a fall-back position that's provided for in the statute.\n I understand that   that may appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as   taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if it is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts, whether they are truly retirement accounts or   or if they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify under this statute. If   if you want to open it up and   and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under 522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on what can be potentially exempt under that statute.\n No. Well, obviously, it's   it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.\n That's correct.\n And it includes IRA's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n The section 408 reference is   does not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is a further condition to place on the   the exemption. First of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum requirements for an IRA to qualify as a   as a tax-favored plan. That  \n Ms.   Ms. Karlan says she doesn't know of any   of any IRA that did place a   a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the exemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that   that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?\n Absolutely. Those are customizable plans. Any person can go into  \n They can, but do   do you know that there's   there's one out there? I don't know  \n I   I do know of several out there.\n You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you? (Laughter.)\n I did not create one for this case. No, I did not. But they   they definitely exist. In fact, in the Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected that she would only receive periodic payments based upon her age, and that was found to be exempt by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel because that qualified. The payments were based upon her age, and it was then a similar plan because she could not access the funds at any time but only for the specified reason such as age.\n Was that   was that an IRA that she had? It was an IRA?\n My understanding is, yes, it was under section 408(b) was   that's my understanding based upon that case.\n Let me   let me ask you. Maybe this is irrelevant, but were   were these restrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is no, why would anyone so restrict his   his IRA?\n I   I do not know if that one specifically was, but no. These have not been set up through  \n But why   why would anyone do that? They're   they're qualified without these restrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his   his rights to   to withdraw?\n Clearly to protect the money potentially for retirement and   and just as  \n In other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?\n That's  \n I   I want to make it tough so that I   I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the motivation?\n Well, that would potentially be a motivation because clearly the money is there readily accessible at any time to   to buy anything that the debtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 30 or 40 years old can liquidate their   their IRA account, whereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't have that kind of access  \n Should we put any weight on the title, on the name? I mean, I   I can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress trying to fool people? (Laughter.)\n Was the Federal Trade Commission? Should they investigate? What   I mean, the   the   I think of it as an account that's basically aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at retirement, which has usually to do with age.\n Well, the   the name is clearly not determinative. Also, Congress in the   in the  \n I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any   I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any indication, when people passed this, that they didn't think they would be? Any   any reference in the terrible words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?\n Yes. First of all, Congress did historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status overall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account is set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e)   522(d)(10)(e) requirements that   that are much more stringent in the requirements of the traditional IRA.\n Well, are they? Because there was one statement   I think it was in Ms. Karlan's brief   that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as long as you're willing to pay the penalty.\n That's a misnomer that that's a   a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow as a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to payment. They have the right to borrow the funds. However   for example, in the New York Police Department pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their pension plan funds. However, they   as long as they're employed there, they have to continue to repay that.\n What   what if they don't repay it? What's the sanction?\n There is a 10 percent penalty. However, as the bankruptcy  \n But what   where   where would the   where would the principal repayment come from? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the balance was from the   the person's account.\n That would be correct.\n I mean, we call it   the   the loan feature then boils down to a   a withdrawal subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the plan.\n Plus 10 percent you say.\n That's correct. However  \n So it's just   just like an IRA.\n But   but this is in the bankruptcy context, which makes it completely different. The bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a picture in time. At the time that the debtor files the bankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the debtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor has at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-year look-back period. But because it's a picture in time, it's what the   the debtor can reach is what the   the bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that   that the debtor owns. This is very different than the pension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have   have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there, would be present at the retirement. But because they could have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the ability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially reach. There are other exemptions, of course, set forth in   in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry, but the assets that are not exempt are readily available to repay creditors, for   for the benefit of the creditors. Therefore, that   that makes it significantly  \n Subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?\n That's correct. That's correct.\n The   the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view.\n That's correct. Yes, they do. They do. Additionally, the petitioners' IRA's are   by allowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the other plans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much more like a savings account. It's not any form of deferred compensation. They can't look to that to fill a salary void after they retire because the money may not be there. Unlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, they could have liquidated those funds prior to their reaching any age or any illness that   that may befall them.\n But there   there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.\n That's correct. That is correct. That is correct. But the   the key here  \n Let me just get   get straight what   what the   what the universe of plans we have in front of us here. Do you assert that there are no other plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?\n That's correct. None of the specified plans listed, the   the ones enumerated.\n Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.\n That's correct.\n None of them is like that.\n None of them is like that. They all have specific factors. There has to be a causal connection between the ability to access the money. Additionally, it's very important that   that an account or plan that qualifies under the statute   it has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. And there's no question that there are definitely IRA's that   that could and do qualify for this exemption. It is, instead, that  \n Do   do you disagree with Ms. Karlan that this is   this is a standardized product so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the standard product.\n That's not   that's not correct. There are many customizable products that are   are out there. In fact, for example, when employers set up different kinds of plans for their employees, they go and they can choose from many different options. For example, they can choose if they even have a   a loan provision built into a   a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the IRA. They   they can be customized because section 408 only sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify for tax-favored status. That   that is an Internal Revenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit additional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it allows the   the individual or the employer because some   there are two different types of IRA's that can be set up by an employer   to go and customize those so that they could potentially meet the statutory requirements.\n These   these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason   what happens if you withdraw for any reason?\n That  \n What is the sanction against   I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for   for a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What   what is the sanction?\n My understanding is that   is that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed by those plans, that that is prohibited. And that   that is similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds in the   she could no longer reach the corpus of the account. The   the lump sum of money was there for her retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the money is not protected at any time. There's no prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds from the account other than the payment of the penalty. But whether an account or plan qualifies under the statute, it   it   you look at the language of the plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument renders the terms of the statute superfluous because, first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans, and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is not based upon any factor other than the   the account holder wanting to withdraw the funds.\n The right to receive 100 percent is   is dependent on a factor, isn't it?\n Yes, it is.\n Yes. At least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.\n That's correct. Unless you have   or another factor such as for education or for a home loan, something like that. There are several different reasons that you can   you can reach the money and not pay a penalty. However, the penalty is not   is not the deciding factor. It's their ability to access the funds at any time that   that makes that a right of payment. It's not a right of payment without a penalty. It's just that the right to payment exists at all times.\n You don't dispute that   that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.\n That   that   that is   appears to be correct. I don't have those exact statistics, but yes, that   that appears to be correct, that they have   that they may not exercise that at   in great numbers. First of all, going back to the causation factor about the   the ability of the debtors to withdraw the funds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 203 North LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean because of, and that   that is a key point here because if the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is not because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case, this Court found that that reading, the because of reading, absolutely applies to this section of the   the Bankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a direct causal connection is required between the right to receive the payment in the on account of requirements. In   in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever between the right to receive the payments and   and any of the factors enumerated in the statute.\n The words, on account of, in this   this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things. You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things. You may get the same amount whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms of the plan are.\n That's correct. There are, of course, always some other factors, such as you have to first deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But once those barriers are passed, then   then the right to receive the payment has to be at least   one of the causes must be one of these factors. And it has to be enumerated in the plan. It cannot be for any reason, but must be an enumerated reason in the plan. And the   with the penalty, only the avoidance of a penalty is based upon the   the age of the debtor or the   or any of the factors. It's   section 522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status or to the right to receive the payment without penalty. It's only the right to receive the payment overall.\n Does your argument draw a ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument prevails, then these other plans would be affected as well.\n Only to the extent that   that they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute. If   if they are available for payment at any time for any reason, then   then they would not qualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're payable for   for one of the factors and that there's a direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and   and the factors, then   then they would qualify for the exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It is just the types that   currently that the petitioners would have or that people would have that would allow the access at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for exemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist, that can exist. It's just that people have set these up from standard plans allowing them access. Whether they access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory requirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can and do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that the petitioners' don't. The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to claim this exemption. The   the debtors knew or   or potentially should have known that   that their IRA's were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time that they filed because of the way that   that these had been construed for a long period of time. So that they could have set up accounts that did qualify for such exemption, but   but they did not restrict their access in that way. Thank you.\n Thank you, Ms. McKiever. Ms. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're not required to use it all.\n I'm going to retire early. (Laughter.)\n The   the first point is that there are two rights under IRA's: the right after age 59 and a half or upon death or disability or illness to withdraw the money without any kind of penalty; and there's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiary right, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to a penalty earlier. The existence of that second entirely subsidiary, almost never used right   and the statistic on this is in the green brief at page 23   means that the real essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age. The second point. As this Court said last year  \n You don't really have a right to receive it on account of age. You have a right to receive it without a penalty on account of age.\n Well, at the age of  \n It isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age. It's the right to receive the money without paying a tax.\n Well, that's a right that's very important because let me give you just a mathematical example of the difference.\n It is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says. The statute says  \n The statute gives that right.\n   the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.\n And you do have that right. You also have another right. But the existence of that second right doesn't negate the first right. The statute doesn't here, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you   a plan is eligible only if you have solely the right to receive on this  \n No, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service. And   and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't   doesn't qualify. I mean, I would think that that's  \n That might be your first thought, but then  \n Or   or at least   at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.\n Oh, but I think even if that were your first thought, you would then get to the implication that many of the Justices have been pressing today, which is the implication of that for all plans is tremendous because all plans give   well, I shouldn't say all plans, but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you early access to your money, and that's valuable to you. That's why in section  \n Is it true that none of them give unfettered access? They're all qualified in some fashion. Do you agree with that?\n Well, the qualification of hardship has been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to buy a house and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You want to sent your kid to school and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You have huge, you know, consumer loans and you could consolidate that? That's a hardship. So it's not as if IRA's operate differently from everything else in the system. That's why  \n Well, yes. You   you don't have to make up a hardship. You just say I want the money. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.\n I think that's  \n I don't even have to lie about the hardship. I mean   (Laughter.)\n I need the money. I don't have the money. That's a hardship. If you   if all you have to say is the magic word hardship, I think that's why we would say IRA's are similar plans or contracts because this Court has made it clear similar is not the same thing as identical. So if similar reasons allow you to withdraw, that's enough. And that's why in section  \n In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?\n As I read the New York City  \n Without any qualification for disability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me the money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan that works like that?\n I don't know, but the New York City Police Department plan appears to work like that. You can take the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.\n Has any judge ever taken the view that   adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that while you can't put the whole IRA   exempt the whole IRA, but you can exempt 10 percent of it?\n Not to my knowledge.\n At least you ought to get that much, it seems to me, under his   his analysis.\n We'd be happier with 10 percent than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that way. The second point is a point that comes out of this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a line that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, which IRA's do. And this may have led to some of the confusion, I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement account. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an individual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you put money into while the money accumulates before you're ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that are customizable. And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at all or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that they would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for a customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible. That's why we think the most sensible reading of the statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them is necessary for the support of the debtor. Thank you.\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is the safety of police officers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in an inherently unsafe situation.\n May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips? Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?\n Well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit because  \n But it wasn't   it wasn't in the questions  \n This Court  \n   on which we granted cert?\n This Court in Procunier treated the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the underlying merits of the case and   and, in fact, skipped over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address the qualified immunity issue. And presumably  \n How   how  \n   the Court could do the same thing here.\n How do we do it? It goes right to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close question as to whether the police did or did not exceed the reasonable bounds   reasonable bounds. Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury verdict against you, and   and then I think, well, yes, but I begin to come   become disturbed if I think of qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So   so having read through the thing, I   I preliminarily start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive force, I mean, given   you know, I'm using that in quotes.\n Right.\n The jury said it was. Who am I to say it wasn't  \n Well, I mean, this   this  \n   in that situation? But qualified immunity. So now, what do I do?\n Well, in the first instance, it's reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here. This Court has already  \n We   don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or  \n With respect to the historical facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you have   that   that's subject to clearly erroneous review. On the issue of whether or not the conduct at issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at least a mixed issue of fact  \n Well, a lot of it may depend on the  \n   and law that this Court has decided as de novo.\n   on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and   and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.\n It   it seems to me that   Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in Michigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law. To be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be   and obviously the officers' position in this case   is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and   and candidly of the other individuals who were being   being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.\n Have you responded to my initial question? Have you said all you want to say about qualified immunity?\n No, Justice O'Connor. My   my basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a   a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and   and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances. So if I   if I cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously I   I hope I can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there   that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.\n Well, what is the   what is the function of a jury in this case? What does the jury verdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we know from the jury verdict. Other   I think what you're saying is that these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a demurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n I   I'm not saying that that would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and   and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the  \n We don't know the fact   what facts were found because all we have is in the jury verdict that this was excessive force. Period. That's all.\n But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg. So the   the facts that you know are the facts as they're described  \n But it's like was  \n   by the respondent's brief.\n   the defendant negligent. Is that more or less a conclusion of law? We don't know in what respect from the jury verdict. And here, were these police officers acting   did they use excessive force.\n Well, we know precisely what they did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the   of the search. We know that. There's no   there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.\n Wasn't there a fact issue as to whether she was handcuffed for   even for a short period after the search had been completed?\n I don't think there is a factual question like that because I don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case. There   there was never an argument made to the jury that this   that this extended beyond the   the period of the end of the search. The argument that was made to the jury was that the search should have   should have been limited to the room where the suspect was   was a resident or that the police should have made a decision somewhere in the   before the end of the 2-hour search that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they were arguing that   that it even went a little further in terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth Amendment violation in its own right.\n But if   but if it made a difference as a matter of law, what   what should we assume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that they found the facts in the way that the   a plaintiff argues them or that you think they are?\n I think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you   and   and the jury determined that there   that it was unreasonable, then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact   that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to whether that's de minimis under the circumstances. But   but I agree. I mean, obviously there is a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean, this Court has already decided that in the Fourth Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.\n Now, in doing it as a matter of law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in this case, if   if I remember correctly, one of the officers testified that had they followed normal protocol, once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the building, the   the main building  \n Well, the   all of the grounds actually.\n Is that the whole compound?\n Yes.\n That   that they would have   they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he wasn't sure why they didn't. We   do we   do we consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as   as to what is or is not excessive?\n I think if this Court could determine that, as a matter of course, the   the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis. That   I think what's important to keep in mind in this context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about four individuals who are being detained under these circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for the police officers under the   under   when trying to decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing. So, you know, is it possible that police procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes that he can take away   you can remove the handcuffs? That may be, although I don't think there's much in the record here to   to reflect that. But what the police said here   and I think it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified that if something had gone wrong, if either a police officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a   in the context of executing the search warrant, the first question that would have been asked is what was the least that could have been done to prevent those injuries from occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite rightly   and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace under the unquestioned command theory of   of law   is that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of a reasonable search, we will make our way through the search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order to minimize the detention and we will eliminate   and I mean, literally eliminate   the entirety of the risk either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.\n Okay. I take it you obviously don't want us to   to come down with a kind of a finicky version of   of excessive force as the touchstone, and I take it you don't want us to come down with simply a blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do anything in   in restraining occupants so long as it is not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a   a statement that would be the kernel of the holding that you want?\n I'm   I'm quite comfortable with the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you   you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in order to  \n But in the facts there, there were no handcuffs. He   he was just detained. So  \n I understand that, and   but my   my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation.\n So   I mean, I don't   would   would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for   for purposes of applying Summers?\n Yes, but it's important to put that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to the   not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant. It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we know that there has either been a crime that's likely to be taking place in the premises. It only   it only extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's only when the search is for contraband, not just for any evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and anybody else who happens to be on site.\n Well, it doesn't   why is contraband magical? Wouldn't   wouldn't your point be when   when the reason they're investigating gives cause to believe that there may be physical danger  \n Justice Scalia  \n   from letting people wander around?\n   absolutely.\n Which is the case with contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons as well.\n I think the important point here is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These are guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more dangerous than any other circumstance the police are likely to confront.\n But would you be happy then with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm Summers and   but Summers said special circumstances or possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case. And the only verdict part that I think we're concerned with here   it was not about four people. It was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena, the jury found that there was a violation of her   of her Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have found   you said   I don't know if you misspoke. You said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it, I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs, both after the time they had secured the place and also after the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.\n Well, it   it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained  \n But, Mr.   Mr.   but may I point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue to the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to release an individual detained in connection with a lawful search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever is sooner.\n Right. That   I understand that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record and it was never argued to the jury that this search   that   that her detention lasted beyond the period of the search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police officers specifically said in his closing argument, there is no issue but that she was released at the time of the   that when   as soon as the search was   was ended, the   the warrant was executed.\n I wonder why the judge gave this instruction then.\n Because   because what he's   well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.\n And why   why there was   there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one. But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page 255 of the joint appendix  \n Yes.\n One question concerns whether the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable? Those two questions   my first is a procedural question. Did counsel for the defendants object to the jury getting   those two questions being submitted to the jury?\n No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't. And   and  \n Well, it seems to me that the judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is whether there was a   a detention, was force greater than was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the duration was longer than reasonable under the circumstances.\n Right. Justice Ginsburg, you have to put that in context. The argument of the plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have ended at either of two points: after they had completely cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at some point after that when they had asked her questions and determined that she had no particular involvement with Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found, was that that was the reasonable break point. Our argument is that's not consistent with the notion of unquestioned command and   and is wrong as a matter of law. And there is no evidence   no evidence. There was no testimony that she was kept for a period beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very important to understand that.\n And you're saying that the   the mere fact that it   it went to the jury, even went to the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we have to listen to what the jury said. Is that   is that  \n Right. If it's wrong as a matter of law, that's   then that's absolutely right. But there was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The only thing he said was, he   he didn't remember. That was   the question was put to the police officer. Was she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it. There's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally made up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of the jury. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n You might save your time. Yes. Mr. Shanmugam.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: When executing a search warrant to investigate a violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate the orderly completion of the search. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the Fourth Amendment. Under the standard for excessive force claims first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers, the degree of force used here was not excessive. The same considerations that justified the detention of the occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use of handcuffs during the detention.\n Then this case should not have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said  \n We  \n   because you   you just said that this   the handcuffs   the circumstances   the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.\n Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. It is our view that as a matter of law, the officers would have been entitled to prevail on the constitutional issue with regard to excessive force. And it's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for summary judgment. They also orally moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence, and that motion was denied. Now, we also believe that the jury, quite frankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by Justice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the jury only received one very general instruction on Summers detentions.\n Well   well, has the   the objection to the instruction been preserved here?\n Perhaps an argument could be made that it's fairly included within the questions presented. There was an objection made at trial and an objection made before the Ninth Circuit as well, but our fundamental position is that the jury was simply given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue. This instruction  \n But on the   on the question whether they preserved the issue, I   I took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question. They did not object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an instruction as such.\n That's correct.\n But they   they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?\n I think that's true. It is true that they didn't object to the specific special verdict set of questions. I think they proposed slightly different language. But ultimately I think our primary submission is that as a matter of law on these facts, no constitutional violation occurred.\n When you   is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the   that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?\n We would concede, I think, Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where there are disputed issues of historical fact. We would submit that there are no relevant  \n Well, but is   is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than   than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?\n Well, there are certain  \n It's historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive. Is that any different from the question as   of was this seizure unreasonable? If you submit the one to the jury, you may as well submit the other.\n Justice Scalia, those facts may be disputed in a particular case. We would submit that they really weren't disputed here, but there may actually be a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used handcuffs and the  \n So when  \n   or no we didn't use handcuffs.\n   when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not.\n We believe that it is  \n It's not a matter of law.\n   a mixed question of fact and law, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially  \n Why   why any more so   why any   any more so than   than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?\n Well, we would submit that it is no different from the question whether officers had probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a question subject to de novo review, over your dissent, admittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their conduct.\n Are   are you saying that the only basis on   on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the   the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?\n We believe that that certainly is the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact  \n Well, I think you have to say that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you know, the handcuffs   the police had a right to do that, but she was held too long, she was   they   they yelled at her, she was taken into a   a place that was uncomfortable. If   if that's true, then we have to sustain the jury verdict.\n I think that the handcuffing was the key factor at trial, and I think that the best evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her excessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not part of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.\n No, no. But the instruction that was given   and one was read that's in the briefs   it seems to me a   a perfectly good instruction.\n I think that that's true, but I think that the instruction didn't really provide any guidance on excessive force specifically. It was really an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the detention more generally, rather than with regard to excessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v. Connor type instruction.\n Well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this   the denial of that instruction here.\n Well, there were objections to the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps an argument could be made   and perhaps Mr. Phillips will make the argument on rebuttal   that it is fairly included within the questions presented.\n I don't know how you can   you can say that the only thing that was before the jury was the handcuff when the   there was evidence that she was treated very roughly in   in the first instance, she was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for her life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the jury was asked to determine.\n Justice Ginsburg, it was the primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were other issues. I think that the other relevant use of force was the initial detention at gunpoint, but   and those   and I would add that those are the two factors on which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's verdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the initial use of force and with regard to the continued use of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support the officers' use of force in both instances.\n But   but may I just ask a sort of very basic question? One of the instructions reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it   if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you telling us that you think the answer to that question is a question of law that the judge should provide rather than the jury?\n Assuming that that instruction is correct   and that might very well be a valid instruction  \n Well, it was correct.\n It may very well be a correct instruction  \n All right.\n   with regard to a challenge to the manner of the detention itself. In that instance, then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I think even then the teaching of Ornelas  \n Then it's not a question of law. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact to the jury?\n It is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is  \n It's a mixed question?\n The jury's job is to   to resolve the underlying factual issues and then  \n Well, I understand the historical fact, but I'm   I'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by the jury or entirely by the judge?\n We believe that that actually is ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of whether or not probable  \n So this instruction should not have been given.\n That's correct  \n I thought your position was that it   it may be submitted to the jury, but that it may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's the way we are able to set standards for later cases.\n I think that's exactly right, and I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas. And it may very well be that a more specific instruction should have been given so as to make clear that the jury had specific issues of historical fact to resolve. But ultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in the sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely the reasons given in Ornelas. And if I could just say a couple words on the substantive issue of excessive force. We believe that in cases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely be allowed to use handcuffs. In this case, I would just add that there were several additional case-specific factors that justified the use of handcuffs. In addition to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two members of a violent gang were living at the house. In addition, the officers had previously visited the house on two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions. And our fundamental problem with the Ninth Circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers in the course of a detention should really stop and investigate whether or not each   each individual that they encounter poses a safety threat. And we believe that that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise. It would effectively divert officers from the primary task at hand and could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather than expediting the completion of the search. And for that reason, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's rule, its substantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.\n How long did it take them to find out whether the   these other dangerous people were there?\n To find out whether?\n Whether the people they were afraid of were   were on the premises?\n Well, you know, I don't know that they ever actually made a   a determination other than that Mr. Romero was not on the premises. I think they figured that out once they had actually identified each of the individuals, which was fairly early on in the detention.\n Thank you. Mr. Hoffman.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Let me start on the issue of   that Mr. Phillips said we made up. Actually we didn't make it up. The claim that Ms. Mena was detained past the time of the search was made throughout the case. If you look at footnote 3 in the Ninth Circuit opinion in 2000, the issue of the length of the detention was a factual issue that precluded summary judgment. Ms. Mena claimed that the detention lasted for 2 to 3 hours. The officers claimed that it lasted 90 minutes. But more than that, the   the jury   the   the special verdict asked the jury to find whether Ms. Mena had been kept for a longer time than reasonable, and in fact, in the closing argument, it was argued that Ms. Mena had been kept beyond the time that the search ended. And not only is there not any   not only is there evidence in the record, there is overwhelming evidence in the record that Ms. Mena was kept for a period of time, at least 30 minutes, give or take, and possibly as long as an hour. And this is not based on Ms. Mena's testimony.\n Do you find that the   that the   do you define the end of the search as before they started videotaping everything they had done?\n Well, they were videotaping during the course of the search. But if I can go through the facts which might clarify things. Officer Muehler, who was the officer in overall charge of the   of the search, testified at trial that the search ended at 8:40 a.m. Officer Brill said a little bit later than that. He tied   but there's a second video. There are two videos. The second video is from 8:50 to 8:57. At the time that the second   the second video started at 8:50, Officer Brill testified that the search was over. The   the evidence log   the last entry on the evidence log is 8:45 in terms of evidence being logged into the   into the case. Officer Brill testified that Ms. Mena was kept for at least 10 or 15 minutes after the end of the second video and her handcuffs were not released until she was brought back around from the   the separate converted garage back into the house and  \n Where   where is that testimony?\n The testimony   Officer Brill's testimony? Is actually   they cite joint appendix number   on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked   they continue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was released? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or 15 minutes after 8:57. In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually consistent with prior testimony by the videographer herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted. The   the point being   and if you take the distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was   was kept in handcuffs at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account. And one of the ironies of the case is that there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search ended. And so while this  \n But not from these premises.\n No. But in fact, this was a   the search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up at his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had   was   was to radio the start of both searches, and so there was  \n But the   the   I thought that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called   that the warrant covered weapons that were there.\n Yes.\n That they were looking for weapons.\n They were looking for a gun.\n They were not looking for a gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?\n Well, I think the  \n Did they have a warrant, a search warrant?\n I think the warrant covered   I think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and   and the   I believe the warrant  \n Well, this was a   this was a pretty extensive search warrant that they had.\n Yes.\n Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the  \n Well, it's the same warrant I believe, Your Honor, in terms of   we don't have   there's not a lot of information in the record about  \n Well, wasn't   I thought that this warrant referred to a particular address, a particular house, not   not any house where one might find Romero.\n No, no, no. It   it referred to the two houses, one on Cimmaron.\n Well, was the other house his mother's house?\n Yes. The location number one is his mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's   and Officer Muehler and this team was in charge of both of these searches pursuant to the same warrant. They had information that   the reason they did that is that they had information that   that he lived in this poorhouse, that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and that he also visited his   his mother from time to time.\n Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and   and the mother   nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this   they knew pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.\n Well, they knew right away.\n Yes. And that's, I guess, your   your point, that the place where the dangerous man was is not  \n I think that that explains one of the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here because they   they knew that at 8:45, at the time that Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the officers were out of the house and   and everything was done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana possession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted garage with her hands behind her back.\n You might be able to keep your verdict, I   I think. But I think the problem here is the Ninth Circuit   you go to the Ninth Circuit and you say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's definition for reasons that you say. And   and the Ninth Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a half pages written the reason that this was unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about her immigration status, which you   I don't think you even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's   that's the bulk of the   of   of   that's the bulk of the analysis. And   and these are the words that I think they're objecting to. And by any standard of reasonableness, Mena was   the   the officers should have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long before the   the   because she wasn't a threat. And that was long before the end of the search. And what their point is on that is, you know, if that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT teams because they can't operate that way. They   they can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual   if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there for the search for a couple of hours, then they release her. Now, that's their argument. So they're objecting not so much to   to the fact they have to pay $30,000   or they may object to that. But they're   they're objecting to the holding of the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again, though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way not to do it. But   but I want to know your view of what I see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong.\n Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd   I'd say that the   the Court could affirm the judgment in this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that we  \n Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.\n And in fact   and I   I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.\n Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications  \n Right.\n   of the Ninth Circuit's analysis  \n Right.\n   not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.\n I think   I think that there   I would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two parts really. On the questioning issue, I would just say that that   that was not an issue that was presented to the jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment violation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the Ninth Circuit. What we did   we did say in our   in our brief to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to   to Summers detention. We did say that.\n Well, we could say is their opinion   that's their opinion. It's beside the point, et cetera.\n Right. So, I mean, I   I think on questioning, you know, we   we haven't been pushing that issue.\n If   if two of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without   to make the judgment without taking those two factors into account?\n Well, I think what   first of all, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on. The jury found that she had been detained longer than was reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This is a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that. And we've argued in our brief that if the Court did something on questioning, it would really be issuing an advisory opinion in this   in this situation. And, you know, we've   we've argued the point and we're prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that question because it's obviously an important question. In our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that that's contested.\n Well  \n I don't  \n   well, it does seem to me that  \n Excuse me.\n It   it does seem   seem to me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on   on this key point of when she had to be released. The officers should have released her when it became clear she posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.\n Well  \n I think that is critical to its holding.\n Well  \n And that implies that they have a   a duty at the outset to determine whether   what her status is rather than to go around looking for guns and   and to secure the premises. That's   that's one of my concerns with that.\n Well, I would have a different position on that. First of all, I think that the judgment can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of this issue because it was a   a jury verdict and   and the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question 5 or 6.\n The   the first ground being? Just an unreasonably long  \n Detained beyond the   the length of the search. And so I think technically the judgment can be affirmed on that ground. But with respect to the handcuffing, the position that we would say is that, first of all, you   you would have to view the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. Now, it's been   there's been a lot of questioning about what that means and what the jury's role is. As we understand it, if Ornelas applies to this decision, which we assume the Court would do   and that is, that you would first have to take the light   all the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, including the possibility that the   the jury rejected as being incredible the statements that the officers made in terms of justification, if there was evidence in the record to show that there was contradicting evidence, which there is in this record. And so the facts that   that the other side has tried to argue are the facts on which you would make that constitutional decision are not the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. In the light most favorable to the verdict, there was   there was lots of planning. There was a tactical plan in writing that the jury got to see, which said that the   the plan here was to go in and make the SWAT entry, to see if there were non-suspects there. They would be patted down, identified, and released. The jury was entitled not to believe the other side's claim that they didn't say when they were going to be released and believed that the plan was to release them as soon as it was ascertained that they did not have the connection in   in the situation. And in fact, there's testimony from the officers that they knew that they weren't gang members and they knew that they weren't connected to the crime. And they were completely cooperative, and they didn't resist arrest and they didn't flee. And Iris Mena is 5 foot 1   5 foot 2 inches, and the jury had a videotape of exactly how they looked. The officers had a total plan. They   they exercised their command of the situation from the beginning. They cleared it. They made sure it was safe. They took people outside through the pouring rain, which actually they say there wasn't evidence about that.\n Medium   medium rain.\n Well, actually at   at joint appendix number 183, Officer Allegra, who was one of the entry team, said it was pouring. So   and in fact, the stipulation of facts said it was heavy. So Iris Mena was being   was being demure when she talked about that. You can even see the rain on the videotape. And so they took her outside. They took all of them outside. They put them in this little room, which is not connected to the house. They had one or two armed officers outside. There was no place for them to go. They couldn't interfere with the facilitation of the search because they were in this room. They couldn't flee because there's only one way out, a door. There were two armed guards there. And   and if all they had to do was sit these four people, who were not connected to any gang activity, as to which they had no suspicion ever developed that they had any connection to Mr. Romero, who had already been arrested at his mom's house  \n They can't have a flat rule that while you're conducting a search, you   you can restrain anybody that you find assuming the search is for a crime that   that involves violence.\n Well, I think that the  \n I don't want to have to make that call all the time, you know.\n Well, but   but officers do make that call all the time. They make it in the context of Terry stops. They make it in the context of lots of Fourth Amendment issues. In Summers   in Summers, the man was detained. In many of the post-Summers cases, including many cited by the other side and the Government, handcuffing is not viewed as routine. Handcuffing is viewed as something that substantially aggravates the nature of the seizure  \n If that's true, is it routine in   I mean, here what sort of pushes the other way on this is this is a dangerous gang. They have lots of weapons and they have previously gone to this house, which I gather   sometimes when I read it, I think it's like a warren of little rooms. On the other hand, maybe it isn't. I haven't seen the house. There are a lot of buildings around, and they think a lot of people here   we don't know who's what, and we make a mistake in this and we're dead. You know, I mean, so that's painting it the other way. But where you have guns and   and houses and gangs and so forth, now that's why they say that it's reasonable in those circumstances to say, when we find someone in the house, we handcuff them through the search. We might let them go earlier, but that's up to us and we don't want the courts second guessing us on that. Now, what's   what's painting it their way, and I'd like you to respond.\n I   I understand that. I guess the   the problem with that is that that means that no matter who they find   and in this case is a good example of it. They were worried that they might find the gang member who had a gun there, and that's what they were looking for. Okay. And so they used the SWAT team. That seems perfectly reasonable that they would use a SWAT team the way they did. And they went in and within literally 4 or 5 minutes, they had   this is a tiny, little house. They had cleared the house. They had figured out all the occupants. They put them in a room completely under their control where they couldn't get away from anything. They knew there were two 40-year-old people, a young hippie, and   and an 18-year-old girl that was 5 foot  \n Did they search that room?\n Yes. They searched that room. So the room was searched before they went there. They searched all the rooms. They searched Ms. Mena's room and found absolutely nothing there. And   and the testimony   and this goes to Justice Souter's question.\n Did they   did they search the individuals too to make sure  \n Yes.\n I assume they did.\n Oh, yes. They   they searched the individuals. They   they   you know, they completely made sure that   that when they put them in that back room, there was nothing in the room. There was nothing on the individuals. There was nothing that   that could cause them danger. And   and the jury, I think, was entitled to   to look at those facts and   and to hear the facts and to see the facts  \n How did the qualified immunity question get resolved here?\n Well, the  \n And what   what role did that play in all of this?\n Well, at the   at the district court level, the   the district court heard a rule 59. But one of the things about this case is it was tried right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got to decide qualified immunity. This was June 2001 actually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether the proper standard of qualified immunity had been applied. The district judge, looking at the facts, found that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the search. The district judge found that. And then in   in the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of these issues. And basically the   the qualified immunity   on the   on the over-detention claim, I think they've conceded that there just isn't any justification for   I mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes. I mean, that   this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is too long on a   on a Terry stop when there's actually reasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her. With respect to the handcuffing issue  \n Is it clear that it was 30?\n Well, I think in viewing the light most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to assume that   that the jury could have found an hour. But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got something that just could not possibly be considered de minimis under any kind of exception. And   and that's why they fought it on the facts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at any point in this. And with respect to handcuffing, I think our position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all, doesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has consistently tried to equate detention with restraint. And I think what   what Summers indicated was that this Court was willing to allow people to be detained during the course of a search for three specific reasons. And when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the justifications, this Court specifically said it was endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be very much different asking someone to sit around  \n Doesn't that just go to the point that it's not clearly established at least?\n Well, no. I   I don't think that is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in   in   Summers doesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks about having to justify force based on a   on a Fourth Amendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the Court, first of all, used the   the analysis that we have argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out in an unreasonable manner.\n Well, but that was ill individual, a single individual  \n Well  \n   unclothed, et cetera  \n No. I   I understand that the facts were more egregious, but the   the Court's analysis for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity standpoint   for a reasonable officer reading that opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One is that the proper analysis to determine whether handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is   is allowed has to be decided under the kinds of justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham analysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of cases that   that allow officers to do that. Lots of lower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out differently depending on the facts and circumstances confronted. The second thing, the   the point about the disabled person and the particular facts made that case particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those were additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit didn't say that the constitutional standard was particularly abusive or egregious. It   it applied traditional Fourth Amendment analysis. And finally and I think very important and not dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is that the Ninth Circuit in   in Franklin rejected a blanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in Portland. The Portland police department had a policy that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search is over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that kind of policy because Summers and   and Graham require it to be individualized justification for that   for an additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's allowed in Summers. And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing to what it   to   to the circumstances in Dunaway, to   to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of the   the issues here. If   if the  \n And what do we do if we think the Ninth Circuit was off base in   in whether Mena could be questioned about her immigration status?\n Well, I   I think that  \n That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.\n Well, it's certainly   it's certainly an alternative ground. It's not   it doesn't affect, I think, our verdict. And so I think what   I mean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as improvidently granted, could say to the court that it   that it should reverse that part of the ruling.\n It might be useful to say they were wrong in  \n Well, that   you   you could say that. I mean, I would   on the merits of the question, I   I would like to   if we were reaching that, I would argue that the Ninth Circuit   that   that there is   there should be a limit on questioning in a   in a Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of Terry analysis that the majority of the   the circuits apply.\n What   what will do if we thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word, disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That   that was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted garage with a bed.\n Well, I mean  \n I mean, I   I thought this woman was standing in   by some grease rack or something and she was  \n She wasn't standing by a grease rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door because the door had basically been obliterated on a very cold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and after   and had been taken through the   the pouring rain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a coat or shoes. And she was made to sit by there and she was very cold and uncomfortable. And she did complain that the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that they were uncomfortable and could they be removed. It's not a garage in   in the way that the vision of it, but also if you look at it, it's   and the   the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of this. You could see that the   the occupants were made to be in a very uncomfortable situation that was unnecessary. And that   that was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994. I think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994 search. You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-suspect as to whom the   the officers didn't have that   that kind of   of suspicion. And the Fifth Circuit found that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to the officers. So from our standpoint, on the issue of being detained past the time, I think it's just a clear case. I think the other side has conceded that if   if there's this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment has to be affirmed on that basis. On   on the handcuffing issue, we believe the same principle has to apply because the facts have to be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and when you view those facts, I   it   it is   no reasonable officer would believe you could do those things to Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the time. And I think that it would be   what the   what the United States and   and what petitioners' counsel is asking for is really for a radical change of law themselves. We're happy with Summers and Graham and the way that applies, and the   the jury instruction was based on   on Summers and Graham and on Franklin. The language is taken directly from those cases. And   and the   the jury in a case like this   qualified immunity obviously provides some protection for   for officers that when   when a reasonable officer wouldn't know these things. But jury verdicts also play a crucial role in a civil rights case. In this case, a jury of our community found that Iris Mena had been subjected to an abuse of   a specific abuse of authority in being held beyond the time of   of the search, even at a time when the prime target was   was free to go about his business with a citation, and was held in these painful handcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances where, in the totality of the circumstances, she was treated much more harshly than anything this Court, I think, contemplated in the Summers case. And I think that officers know how to   officers know how to handle the Fourth Amendment issues involved in this case. They don't need a special rule because that rule would end up meaning that when you go in and you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody is still going to be subjected to this kind of serious intrusion on their individual liberty. And so we would urge the Court not to go down this new path that the United States and the petitioners are asking and to affirm the judgment because it was based on clearly established principles that this Court and other courts around the country have   have established. Thank you very much.\n Thank you, Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Phillips, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. I want to start with essentially the question that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any individual detainee. Those are rulings that I submit to you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that basis alone. At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact, proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative ground that there were 15 minutes here. The Ninth Circuit expressly never   or didn't expressly but never said one word about a period of time after the search ended in this particular case, and that's not an accident because there is no testimony. The officer said he didn't remember and when asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent with your memory, well, of course, it would. He didn't remember anything. So there's nothing in that evidence, and there's no way   I have looked at that tape. I ask you to look at that tape. I guarantee you there's no way you can draw any inference as to at what point in this process she was released vis-a-vis the end of this particular   this particular search being executed.\n So   so do we have the tape here?\n I assume you have the tape. It's part of the record. It should be in the clerk's office. If you don't have it, I'd be more than happy to send you a copy. The  \n But there was no   there was no objection to that question going to the jury, was the duration unreasonable.\n Of course not, Justice Ginsburg, because the issue before the jury was whether or not the   we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a   a threat. That was  \n But the jury  \n   their theory of the case, and that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have that affirmative obligation.\n But the jury answered the   just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.\n Not of the search. Of her detention.\n Yes.\n Yes, of her detention. And that was based on the jury's determination that we had detained her beyond the period we had done the sweep.\n So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case? In other words, if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district judge that behaved   gave a proper charge, then the Ninth Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with what the district court and the jury decided.\n Well, the   the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should   we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the matter to go back at this point. And   and that is exactly what this Court does in   you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive damages cases. Juries make punitive damages determinations every day and every day courts of appeals and trial judges review those damages awards de novo because they   because the question is not just what are the historical facts   that you give deference to the jury on   but on the fundamental question of what is the rule of law that will govern the police officers in the execution of search warrants in circumstances like this. They need protection, Your Honor. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs with the potential for abuse. And with respect to Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully controlled confines of federally approved research programs.\n Well, Mr. Clement, the   I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.\n Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases. And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy did so, as well.\n Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market. You don't have that here. As I understand it, if California's law applies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use marijuana will be on any interstate market. And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states. So how do you distinguish Morrison? And how do you distinguish Lopez?\n Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana. And, of course, the Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under Schedule I into the national market.\n Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law? I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.\n Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate. And I think Congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.\n Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume   I'm not saying this is   that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had   say they made such findings. Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?\n I think you would say they were irrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because  \n But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?\n Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question   I think that in   obviously, in all of these commerce  \n Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.\n Well, in your hypothetical   and if I could turn to that   I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.\n But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other   in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v. Filburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?\n Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.\n Absolutely.\n And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.\n But that's quite a different rational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me you're not   you're not appealing to the fact that it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce cannot effectively be implemented without this law.\n Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a different regulatory regime. Here, Congress  \n But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory   you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject   substance from being sold or   in interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter   letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.\n Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market   illegal market, albeit   but market in marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So  \n But to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana.\n Well, first of all, Justice Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to  \n Then I'm assuming   my hypothetical is that California could pass a law that would prevent diversions from occurring.\n Well, in the same way that the Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.\n But just  \n I suppose some   one answer to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.\n Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy. And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though it was focused on what was going to be an   both in that case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the entire class of activities. And if I could  \n But, as Justice O'Connor brought out earlier, all those cases   Wickard, Perez   they all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here, we're told this is different, because nobody is buying anything, nobody is selling anything.\n Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce to activity that the Court described as economic, but not commercial. And I think the production and distribution and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.\n But you're   no, I was going to   your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply   simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it. You're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.\n That's exactly right, Justice Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz and Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in particular, only because it, too, involves a non-commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of  \n Well, I do take issue with that. As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a small farmer. A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market. It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market. He used some of it himself, but part of it was commercial. I think Wickard can be distinguished on the facts.\n Well, Justice O'Connor, it could be   I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was   it was only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm. And  \n The other portion is a matter of [inaudible] interstate commerce.\n Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside   to one side all of the grain that was going to go in interstate commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents. This case is only interesting, he said, because it involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm. And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be consumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the record of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue there. And it's important to recognize that the way the Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it applied to the wheat that was used by the family for consumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation. And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not, is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause  \n And is  \n   authority.\n   this a harder or easier case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?\n Well, Justice Kennedy  \n Does this make your case easier, in a sense, or  \n I think it does, Justice Kennedy, because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit something in interstate commerce entirely, and has exercised that power, so it treats something as effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then takes the complementary step, especially in light of the fungibility of the product, and says, \"We're just going to treat this as contraband simpliciter.\" I think that judgement by Congress has a very definite link to interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to regulate interstate commerce. And I do think there's a sense in which when Congress is regulating the price of something, there's certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small producers and for Congress to say, \"Well, we can still have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority of production.\" But with respect to something that's unlawful to have and is   and has very significant risks precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime. It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal in promoting health. And I think the clearest example of that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been available as a Schedule III substance, called  \n But there's  \n   Marinol.\n   but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked. This was the only one that would. And it   Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. But let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a federal prosecution?\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland Cannabis case   and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion   I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available. But I think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled Substances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue. I think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under California law, is that there's a mismatch between what California law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce. Because the California law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines. And so, if Respondents are right on their Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right because their conduct is lawful under state law or because their   that marijuana use is medical. If they're right, then I think their analysis would extend to recreational use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and would extend to every state in the nation, not just  \n Well, I think  \n   those states that made it lawful.\n Doesn't it depend on how you define the \"relevant class of activities\"? Is it the entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular very narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible to define the class narrowly to escape a   the broad argument that you make?\n Well, I don't think that is permissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard  \n So you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.\n Under the Commerce Clause, I   that's exactly right, that would be our position. It is constitutional on its face, and it   and because of that line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of the statute as a whole  \n But, in Morrison, did the Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify Commerce Cause   Clause legislation by using a long but- for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce? I mean, the Court certainly made that statement.\n Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, but  \n Which cuts against what you're saying.\n Well, with respect, I don't think so. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize   thought it very important to emphasize two things: one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second, the Court also made it clear that the regulation that there   there was not essential to the effectiveness of an overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both points, this case is on the constitutional side of the line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.\n The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use   growing for personal use, under prescription  \n I understand that   I understand that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is not also covered. You're talking about  \n Involved economic activity.\n I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic activity. Because what you're talking about here is the possession, the manufacture, the distribution of a valuable commodity for which there is a ready   unfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.\n If we rule for the Respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in California?\n I would be speculating, Justice Kennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think that what   and that, in a sense, is consistent with the government's position, which is to say, when the government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to prohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition actually would force the price up. And there is a sense in which this regulation, although not primarily designed as a price regulation   the Controlled Substance Act, I think, does have the effect of increasing the price for marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the   and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's all consistent with Congress' judgement here. And if I could return for a second to the point about Marinol, what's important there is that the process of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful component, does two things. One, the manufacturing process allows there to be a safe use for one of the components in marijuana. But it also provides an unambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce Clause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to get people to use more healthful substances, and not use things like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is undermined if Congress can't also address that which is more harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable of being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude marijuana is.\n In other words, the statute is   it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.\n Well, I think, in responding to that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government treats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a particular patient; but that's something that this Court, I think, has previously understood, that the federal regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or doctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.\n Right.\n I think that's the import of the Rutherford decision with Laetrile.\n Do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no acceptable medical use? Say they had a   say there was a judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. Would we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the congressional finding or the judicial finding if that happened?\n Well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind. I think the   the judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance without a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a situation in   and your hypothetical might respond to a different statute that raised a harder question, where Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for changing realities. But, here, Congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III. And I think it's wrong to assume that there's any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect of making it easier to prescribe and more available. But I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe medicine  \n Have there  \n   available to patients  \n   have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the FDA?\n There have been a number of those petitions that have been filed. There was one recently rejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999. There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-iteration effort to change the rescheduling that culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s. So there's definitely been these efforts. But on the current state of the   of the record, there just is not a justification for changing the schedule. And I think both of the briefs talked a little bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the medical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for the individual components in marijuana, that smoked   smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as medicine, because   and that's true, I think, for two reasons. One, there's something like 400 different chemical components in crude marijuana that one would smoke, and it's   it just, sort of, belies any logic that all 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude material that somebody could grow in their garden, and actually have people who do this for a living get involved in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial components, and then manufacturing and making that available. The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery device for medicine, I think, is also something that really doesn't have any future as medicine. What does have a future for medicine, of course, is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial component. That's been done with Marinol. It is true that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form that Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing research to try to figure out different ways to deliver that substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of a   and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that there's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it takes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of the substance and the time that it has an effect on the system.\n May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about   it was, sort of, a categoric point   you, in effect, said, \"If this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them.\" Wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them? That in deciding what class you are going to   or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question, \"What good reasons are there to define a subclass this way?\" In this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits   whether you accept the evidence is another thing   but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug. There's no such argument, I would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category. And, for that reason, isn't there a   isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?\n With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' judgement about defining a class of activities  \n That may   oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're   you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage. And I'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-Congress argument.\n Well, Justice Souter, I have no doubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would find it very difficult to police that line over the broad variety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby. With that, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.\n Mr. Barnett.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I have two points to make. First, the class of activities involved in this case are non-economic and wholly intrastate. Second, the federal prohibition of this class of activities it not essential   is not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. If you accept the government's contrary contentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v. Raich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity.\n Well, on your first point, can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that simple possession of that commodity is a form of participation in the market?\n It can be, or it might not be. If you possess an item that came from the market or is going to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of the marketplace. But if you're in possession of an item that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the market   it didn't come from the market and it's not going to the market  \n Well, but it's fungible.\n That   the fungibility issue is in this case, but the   but a   the fact that a good is fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not make the possession of that good an economic activity. Or  \n Well, you know, Congress has applied this theory in other contexts. One is the protection of endangered species. Congress has made it unlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, the mere possession of it, whether you got it through interstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is, \"We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, period.\" Now, are those   are those laws, likewise, unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce power?\n Not if they're an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, unless those activities are reached.\n Well, why is that different from this?\n Because this class of activities   because it's been isolated by the State of California, and is policed by the State of California, so that it's entirely separated from the market  \n Isolated and   I understand that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the medical use of all of the members of the communes.\n That class of activities is not before the Court. That is actually before  \n No, but it's before the Court when you   when you raise the policing of the problem by California, and saying it's not a   it's not a real problem, you brought it before the Court.\n But that class of activities could be   could be   if this Court limits its ruling to the class of activities that is before the Court, that class  \n Which is   which is what?\n Which is  \n An individual grower?\n An individual who is growing it for her   him- or herself, who has   or has a caregiver growing it for her  \n Gee, what basis  \n   for  \n   what basis is there to draw it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we   we could say people whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that would narrow the category, too. But why does   why does that make any sense?\n Justice Scalia, we believe it makes sense because we are talking about a classification of activities that has been identified by the State of California, and which is rational to distinguish from  \n Oh, but California hasn't identified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far as California law is concerned.\n Well, it's not entirely clear whether communes are okay, as far as the California laws are concerned.\n Why wouldn't it be?\n Because if, in fact, commercial activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking place  \n No, no, they're not buying and selling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and selling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with alleged medical needs.\n I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for   an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other   now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X. But if the state says something about the X, then Congress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me to accept, because I don't see   whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and I can't find any support at all for that in any case.\n The support would come from the exception to Lopez and Morrison that the government is urging that the Court adopt, that the Congress can reach non-economic activity that's intrastate, that's wholly intrastate, if doing so is essential to a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut if they can't reach it.\n Well, here, they say   look, I take it you're using this because I was going to ask you. You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect Boston. You know, we can   oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally. You know, I can multiply the examples  \n Well  \n   and you can, too. So you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?\n By saying that it's all going to depend on the regulatory scheme, what the  \n Yeah.\n   purpose of the  \n So now what you're saying is, in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this. That's a task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in my question. [Laughter.]\n But I see it very well. Here is what they say. They say that, \"By the way, a hundred-thousand people using medical marijuana in California will lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And, second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we won't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is medical.' Certificates will circulate on the black market. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does have an impact,\" they say. Now, what's your response?\n Well, you've raised at least two different practical issues. One is the fact   the number of people who are in the class, and the second is the ability to identify whether they properly belong in the class. As for the number of people, we are talking about a very small number of people. They say a hundred-thousand. They get their figures from the National Organization from Reform of Marijuana Laws. Our figures in our brief come from the government. The figures show it's a very small fraction of persons that would be involved. And their argument is basically   and the logic of your hypothetical is premised on   the more people that go into the illicit market, the better for federal drug policy, because that will drive the price up. You have to   what we're take   we're doing is, we're taking people out of the illicit drug market, which then, under your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction   and Justice Kennedy's suggestion   would lead to a reduction in the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite would be, they're   it's good for federal policy to have more people in the illicit drug market, because that's going to drive the price up.\n No, no, we don't want more people  \n Of course not.\n   in the illicit drug market. [Laughter.]\n Of course not.\n And we don't want low prices, either. [Laughter.]\n But the   but the   but the scheme of   but the class of activities that have been authorized by the State of California will take people out of  \n So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to   the way that   you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress. That's what we'd normally say.\n Well  \n And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.\n Well, within this exception   the threshold issue   I do want to make sure that I focus on this   the threshold issue, which is the issue that has occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity here is economic or non-economic. The government claims it's economic, we claim it's non-economic.\n Well, what it is, is, it's non-economic, and it affects the economic.\n Right. So the threshold issue that is   that   upon which Lopez and Morrison terms   turns is whether it's economic or non-economic.\n Well, I should have thought that regular household chores of   say, performed in an earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic   washing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing marijuana isn't?\n If you accept the government's definition of economic, then every   then washing dishes, today, would be economic, and that  \n No, but even  \n   would be within the   within the power of Congress to reach.\n But even if we accept your definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis upon which we ought to make a category decision. You say it's non-economic because one of these people is a   is a self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for nothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given, or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe that, out of   now I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, a hundred-thousand potential users   everybody is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the backyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're going to get it on the street. And once they get it, under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it and use it. But they're going to get it in the street. Why isn't that the sensible assumption?\n Well, they have an   they have a very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because getting it on the street is going to subject them to criminal prosecution, under both California and federal law, as well as the  \n Yeah, but the   it's also the case that approximately 10 percent of the American population is doing that every day, if I accept the figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting prosecuted.\n But we're talking   in that case, we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for recreation. We are talking about a class of people here who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate the law.\n And if I am a sick person, I'm going to say, \"Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, either.\" I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, it seems to me, to avoid the street market.\n The government, in their brief, asserts that the   that the possession statute that currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why they   which is their explanation for why they failed to enforce the possession statute that they say is so essential to the  \n If one  \n   regulatory scheme.\n   if one takes your view, that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state, somebody whose doctor says, \"This person needs marijuana to live,\" but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use Act   it's just as isolated   no purchase, no sale, grown at home, good friend grows it   and yet you say Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief properly.\n Yes, Your   yes, Your Honor, because there's the   that's the second step of the analysis. The first step of the analysis is the economic/non-economic. If you don't   if the Court stops there, then they could also apply in these other states. But then if the Court adopts  \n But if you   if you buy that   so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument, it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate medical use anywhere.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n All right. Now you're going to have some limiting  \n But a limiting principle is the one that I   was identified by the Court in Lopez in which the government is asserting that if it's an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached. And the difference between states in which there is a state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use, is completely different from a practical enforcement standpoint than a state in which there is no differentiation. Just think of the existence, for example, of identification cards, which the State of California is going to be issuing, like driver's license cards.\n Yeah, but it doesn't right now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your view.\n Well, because   but this is the sort of regulation   the sort of effectiveness of the regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact   I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting the State of California to be able to administer its regime. There is no regime in other states to trust, and, therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which the states are not attempting to pursue the health of their citizens   the goal of preserving the health of their citizens this way, that would fall under the exception which this Court suggested in Lopez  \n This is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things that interests me   I guess, on your framework, Lopez should have come out my way. [Laughter.]\n Well  \n It's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.\n Justice Breyer, that's the reason why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it doesn't reach your result. [Laughter.]\n If that exception were treated as broadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent in Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will swallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited to their facts.\n I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to   what I had to say in Lopez to   was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business. So I would have thought, given the   and I believe that, you know   but, I mean   but that was far further than this, which is just direct.\n But this case is completely unlike those cases. This case is completely isolated. In Lopez, that gun probably did come through interstate commerce, not that I believe it should have made any difference, but it probably did. Here, we're talking about substances that don't. So there's just no literal connection between this class of activities and this interstate market.\n Well, we didn't decide that, in Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce. If the statute in question had applied only to guns that had been transported in interstate commerce, the case might have come out differently.\n I   no doubt, Your   I   and I wasn't suggesting otherwise, Justice Scalia. I'm just suggesting that, here, we have   exactly, that if there had been that interstate connection in Lopez, the case might have come out different. There is no interstate connection whatsoever in this class of cases. None. The only way to make it an interstate connection is through some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in which somebody who's doing something over here is going to have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over there. There is no connection.\n Sounds like Wickard to me.\n Well, Wickard, Your Honor  \n I always used to laugh at Wickard, but that's   that's what Wickard said.\n Wickard  \n Had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce.\n Had that case been about eating wheat, that case would never have arisen.\n Well, that's what it was about, as far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure, there were a lot of   there was a lot more use of the wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but it seems to me the analysis of the case said, \"You take it   you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it yourself, you make it unnecessary for your   to buy it in interstate commerce.\"\n It's   the entire analysis   the entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the farms. And by \"home-consumed,\" it did not mean eating at the family   at the family table; it meant feeding to your livestock and then putting it   your livestock  \n Strange phrase, to mean \"feeding to livestock\"?\n But the  \n \"Home-consumed\" is feed it to your pig?\n But, yes, that's exactly what  \n I don't think so.\n   that's exactly what that general term   how that general term was used in this case.\n But what the Court said, I take it   and I have quoted a lot of the language there   it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in   quote, \"though it may not be regarded as commerce\"  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n   end quote, still can be regulated, quote, \"whatever its nature,\" so long as, quote, \"it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\" Now, that's the language, and I take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.\n With all respect  \n Which is not commerce. Sorry, not commerce.\n With all respect, what   that's   I was about to make that  \n Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce.\n Right. Right. What the Court was using here was the narrower   the traditional definition of \"commerce\" that Justice Thomas has been urging this Court to adopt. And they were saying that, \"We are not going to limit ourselves to that narrow definition of 'commerce.'\" It would include, for example, agriculture and production. That's all going to be reachable, even though it's not commerce, in the traditional sense. But what we would call it today, and I believe what the Court correctly called it, in Lopez, was \"economic activity.\" Production is economic activity. Manufacturing is economic activity. But   it's not commerce, but it's economic activity that can be reached. And that is the activity   that's not only the activity that Farmer Filburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the statute was aimed at. The statute  \n Well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic activity.\n What made it an economic activity in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial enterprise, that it was being used on the farm   not in interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise of the farm.\n Again, I don't think that's   that faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think the opinion covered   including the amount that he consumed himself, and his family consumed.\n The   look, I   for whatever it's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute exempted small commercial farms. People who had backyard gardens weren't even included within the regulatory regime. The regulatory regime was about regulating or stopping or restricting the supply of wheat that got into the market, or that could have  \n Did the opinion make a point of that?\n Pardon me?\n Did the opinion make a point of that?\n It   it was mentioned in the opinion. It was not   it was not a major point of this opinion. But  \n I don't think it was a point of the Court's analysis at all.\n This  \n Could I   could I  \n Could I ask this question. What is your view with respect to the impact of the activities concerned in this case on the interstate market for marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no impact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or decrease the interstate demand? So there are three alternatives. Which is the one we should follow?\n Can I pick \"trivial impact\"? [Laughter.]\n No, but if it   \"trivial impact,\" is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?\n The only effect it could have on the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users from the illicit drug market. And to the extent that they are now in the illicit drug market   and we don't know whether they are or not  \n Well, that would reduce demand and increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way around.\n Well, it would reduce demand and reduce prices, I think. But  \n If you reduce demand, you reduce prices? Are you sure?\n Yes. [Laughter.]\n Oh, you're right. You're right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\n Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes   your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved   if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market. So the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved. You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. Let me ask you a question that would   that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how many people there are in California who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?\n I do not know the answer to that.\n Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?\n It could be, Your Honor, but that also illustrates  \n But if you   if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?\n But whatever   I don't know, because I don't know the number of people using chemotherapy. But whatever the number  \n How many people are there in California? What's the population?\n Thirty-four million.\n Thank you, Justice Kennedy.\n Lots   lots   [Laughter.]\n   lots and lots. They   a hundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy does not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact, if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is enforceable, or not. And the reason   there is reason to assume that   if we ruled your way, that that number would go up. So, if you accept that line of argument, then your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I missing something?\n Well, two things. First of all, whatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people who are sick, who are sick enough to use this. That is not an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example, recreational activity is, where lots of people could just decide to do it. We're talking about people who qualify, on a physician's recommendation, for this particular activity. That will limit the number. But the amount of the people   the effect on commerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn aggregation principle applies to the class of activities in this case, and it does not apply to the class of activities in this case if they are non-economic, as we assert that they are.\n Well   but that is circular reasoning, because the whole   your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are   the numbers are so few   the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-economic.\n Lopez and Morrison stand for the proposition that activities that simply have an effect on the market are not necessary   that does not make them economic. This Court rejected that proposition, that just because an activity has an effect   an economic effect makes the activity, itself, economic. It adopted a principle that's less than  \n Remote, remote, remote economic effect.\n It was inference upon inference upon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.\n But just   just have it   just   whether an activity is economic, you have to look to the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the production of things for sale and exchange, barter. This whole Court's jurisprudence since The New Deal has been premised on the ability to tell the difference between economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty, on the other.\n But your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their   in their supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic premise on which to base constitutional law.\n The premise of our   the premise of our economic claim is the nature of the activity involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of activity it is. The idea   for example, you   prostitution is an economic activity. Marital relations is not an economic activity. We could be talking about virtually the same act. And there is a market overhang for   from private sexual relations to prostitution, but we don't say that because there is a market for prostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in that market is economic. We look at the activities, and we  \n I'd like to ask you one question about the activity  \n Yes.\n   which was brought up before, and I just   I've never understood this. I'm not an expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not. I really don't know. So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, \"FDA, take this off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety.\" The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right into court and say, \"That's an abuse of discretion.\" The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use. So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.\n Well  \n So that's   I just want to know why.\n Well, Your Honor, first of all, that whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of Congress is to reach this activity  \n That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?\n I would  \n If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it.\n   I would simply ask Your Honor to read the amicus brief by Rick Doblin, in which it describes the government's obstruction of scientific research that would establish the safety and efficacy of cannabis by denying supplies of cannabis   of medical   of cannabis for medical experimentation. And then I'd ask Your Honor to read the Institute for Medicine's report, that both the government and I   and we have relied upon in our briefs. There has been no impeachment of this report by the National Academy of Sciences on the medical effect. And what they say is that the   that what information we have is that cannabis does have a substantial medical effect. Smoked cannabis does carry with it harms associated with it, as the   as General Clement correctly pointed out. It does carry with it these ancillary harms. But when people are sick and people are suffering and people are dying, they may be willing to run the risk of these long-term harms in order to get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that cannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. I'd just ask Your Honor to look at that, which is in the record.\n Are prescriptions, under California law, limited only to those people with life-threatening illnesses?\n They are limited to a list of illnesses that are in the statute.\n Some of the illnesses  \n Some of which are life-threatening and some of which are not, Your Honor.\n In one   in one plaintiff's case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening  \n That's correct, Your Honor. She has   she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be controlled by conventional medicines. She's a law-abiding citizen. This goes back to the issue of what the   incentives there are that are created by this. This is a law-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the illicit-drugs market.\n May I just ask you one procedural question?\n Yes.\n And this is   this is a suit for an injunction. And it   basically an injunction against a criminal prosecution.\n And seizure  \n And  \n   of these plants.\n   and there's an old saying, in equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions. So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old saying meant that you have to make your defense in the criminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?\n Well, it is   it is an   we're seeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the statute against these two persons, which includes forfeiture, which has already happened in this case. We've already had Diane Monson's plants seized by the Drug Enforcement Authority. That is not something that we   that we   that has anything to do with criminal prosecution, and yet that puts at risk her supply of medicine, the supply of medicine she needs to get by, to relieve her suffering. I see my time is up. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Barnett. General Clement, you have four minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As I understand Respondents' position, it's effectively that their clients, and clients like them, in their use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically sealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it has no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on the government's overall regulatory regime. And I understand that to be true largely because of state law. And one of the many problems with that mode of analysis is that the state law is not designed only to carve out those transactions that have no effect on interstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory regime. Proposition 215 was not passed as an exercise in cooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make medical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it in interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the marijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether you bought it, whether you grew it yourself. There's a fundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I think, undermines their theory. Now, there's the question now about what kind of impact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme. Now, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from one of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's a hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical users, if their position prevails. Now, obviously, this is all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation, so the numbers may be a bit off. But they suggest that our own government numbers are somehow better, and they cite them on page 18 of the red brief. But the only numbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in the four counties for which there are data, there was   .5 percent of the people use marijuana. Now, if you extend that out statewide to the 34 million people in California, that gives you 170,000 people. So their numbers   using the government numbers actually give you more potentially affected people. I think in trying to figure out how many people would be affected, it's worth considering what medical conditions are covered. And this responds to Justice Kennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or people with terminal cancer? And it's not. And if you want to look at what is covered as a serious medical condition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of the red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it suggests that a serious medical condition   there's a catchall at the end that includes subsection 12   \"Any other chronic or persistent medical system that, if not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety or physical or mental health.\" Now, I think that is an exceedingly broad definition of a serious medical condition for which somebody could be   get a recommendation for marijuana for medical uses. Another point worth considering, in considering the impact on the federal regulatory regime or the effectiveness of California in preventing any diversion, is to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief. One is the People against Wright. There's somebody who's arrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana. They're packaged such that he has one small bag in his pocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his backpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then a pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck. And yet the Appellate Court in California said that he was entitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was for medical use. The fact that he had a scale, and the fact that it was packaged the way it was, could be explained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and that he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off. I think that shows that it's going to be very hard to enforce the regulatory regime. The other case in the reply brief worth mentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case where a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said that it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled Substances Act against a 250-person cooperative. And that just shows that this is not something that will be limited to one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial impact on the government's ability to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Thank you.\n Thank you, General Clement. The case is submitted.\n Good morning. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The injunction in this case violates the most basic principles of the First Amendment. It's a prior restraint. It's a content-based restriction on speech. It's vastly overbroad. It even restricts the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as Petitioner Ruth Craft. The injunction in this case is inconsistent with this country's unique and profound commitment that speech by public officials and public figures be open, robust, and uninhibited. One way in which the injunction is clearly unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit. For example, Ruth Craft is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party to the lawsuit. And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the lawsuit.\n How about you? You're in trouble too, aren't you? (Laughter.)\n Yes, I am, Your Honor. This injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I could be held in contempt of court.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts. I thought that you were not challenging   at least the question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging   the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?\n No, Your Honor. The question presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional. One of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment. All of the statements that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the First Amendment. There is not the requisite actual malice. And so it's our position that the injunction itself is unconstitutional.\n But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.\n Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. It's our position, though, that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of speech.\n But that isn't what you've said in the question presented. Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented? And that would leave the other parts there.\n Well, of course, you're limited to the question presented. Our position, though, is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is unconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by the First Amendment.\n Yes, but you understand Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would affect the first and third parts.\n Well, Your Honor, certainly we believe that the injunction is most clearly unconstitutional in its overbreadth. We believe also and separately the injunction is unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public officials and public figures. But it's also our position that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First Amendment.\n Well, but that doesn't  \n Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?\n No, Your Honor. We don't believe our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran. We believe that all of his speech is just opinion.\n Does he intend to continue making the same comments that he made before?\n His exact words were that perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr. Cochran owes him money.\n All right. Now, let me ask you this. Under your theory, if   if the defendant is judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if the statements are defamatory?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n What is it?\n There is, of course, a remedy. Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There is a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your Honor, there can't be a different rule  \n But if   if the defendant is judgment-proof, what good does that do?\n Your Honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are poor will have injunctions  \n Well   well, your   your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case.\n No, Your Honor, I disagree with that.\n I mean, you   you say he has the remedy of   of counter-speech. We're talking   that's really that doesn't answer the question. The question is, is there anything he can get from the courts other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.\n That's correct, Your Honor. From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a person may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd be collected for the person who gets assets in the future. Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it can't be  \n Well, it   it seems to me that that really avoids the problem   the problem. So suppose we disagree with you about that. Then it's true that there is no   there is no legal remedy that he can get.\n But then, Justice Kennedy, it can't be the rule that poor people have their speech enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in the future.\n Well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and   and people who have money cannot. I mean, that's   that's not a fair rule either.\n No, Your Honor, but that's why there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue a damage judgment. There are many instances in which damage judgments can't be collected.\n It's worthless against a   against a person who has no assets.\n But that's true everywhere in the legal system, Your Honor. And I would also argue here that none of Mr. Tory's statements were defamatory. I would point  \n Now that's another one that is in your brief. You say that these were statements of opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in your question. You   you don't   there were findings made that these statements were defamatory, and your question presented does not seem to me to encompass at all the question whether these statements were defamatory.\n I would disagree, Your Honor. The question presented is whether this injunction, that forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One reason why  \n Not   not this injunction. The question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation   in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation. I   I just don't think it's fairly included within the question.\n Your Honor, what I am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech  \n No, it doesn't. It says whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure violates the First Amendment.\n We would argue  \n There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation. There's nothing in there about that.\n Your Honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And our position is that all of the speech that was expressed in this case is opinion. And it's important  \n All right. Now, if that's so  \n Well   well, there really   there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I   I think we should just proceed on   on some other basis for this argument. We have other questions to discuss.\n Sure. But, Your Honor, I want to just respond to that. The exact statement there was   and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the joint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief. Can a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion. In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling somebody a traitor is opinion.\n All right. That   that   what you've quoted many   much of this I wouldn't repeat in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for   for desisting from that type of activity. All right. Now, those are the findings against you. So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in   with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind. And I want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?\n I would suggest three different ways in which you could write the opinion that distinguished the case. The first is that this injunction is vastly overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the First Amendment. A second way of distinguishing is that defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not permitted in defamation actions. That's quite different than a harassment action. And third, as I've argued, what makes this different is the basis for this injunction is speech protected by the First Amendment. With regard to the findings that you referred to, you mentioned two. The first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor, the only privacy claim in this case was false light invasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when it's based on the same fact. The second basis you pointed  \n Mr. Chemerinsky, this case comes up to us from a California appellate court. Surely they know California law better than we do.\n Yes, Your Honor, but they did not base their decision on the privacy claim because California law is clear that when it's false light invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation action, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School District.\n Well, we're not going to debate among ourselves over what California law is.\n No, Your Honor. All I'm saying is it's important to be clear about what the privacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer, there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions. Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not the privacy claim in this case which was just about false light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted is treated together with defamation.\n Suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house.\n Your Honor, under Frisby v. Schultz, that would be a different situation. Under Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said  \n All right. Well   well, then this   this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the sky is falling and so forth, I   I think we have to be more precise here. I think if it were in front of his house, it would be different. If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages, it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least   I don't know California law   says that you   would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel  \n Well, Your Honor  \n   that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a   of a business?\n Actually, Your Honor, the vast majority of cases have held that you cannot have an injunction for product defamation. And so I think while that's a different and more difficult question, most courts have said no even there. And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never be injunctions. But I am saying that this Court has said there's a very strong and heavy presumption against injunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year history of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld an injunction as a remedy in a defamation action. And, Your Honor  \n Well, if   if this under   the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this   this   your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy. Is there nothing that one can do to stop another from engaging in blackmail?\n Yes, Your Honor, there is. If this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could have filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your Honor, this wasn't extortion.\n What kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction? I mean, why   why do we do this?\n But Your Honor, that's because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are even worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this Court  \n But   but why   is that true in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not sure   I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in the first area, but let's   let's assume the timid person is not sure. So he wants   he wants to get an equitable ruling first, declaratory judgment. He   and he would take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than going to jail.\n But, Your Honor, I'd remind you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader than against limits on criminal penalties.\n I know, but I'm asking you why that   why that should be. If   if you asked a person not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse, having an injunction that you can argue about or going to jail, I   I think they would say that going to jail is worse.\n But, Your Honor, in terms of the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction has always been regarded as worse.\n Always? Do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if   et cetera. I mean, how   how far do you want to push that principle?\n Your Honor, I don't want to push the principle at all to harassment. I believe that injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment actions. I think it is quite important to note that the California harassment statute expressly excludes speech which is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis for harassment. The history of the First Amendment is different. To go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed out  \n Why can't we say that speech that is   is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different? And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not all speech, but only when speech is being used to   to extort money.\n Yes, Your Honor, there can be an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion. There was never the criminal complaint. There was never the civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for extortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section 518, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of property from another with his consent induced by a wrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful use of force or fear. Now, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking  \n Here I think there was   why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that   of that happening?\n Your Honor, this Court is required to do an independent review of the record under Bose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr. Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside. It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage Mr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its protective character simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, the district   I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money   a monetary settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And those sound like findings. It's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the   that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.\n But, Your Honor, since this is a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules under the First Amendment for defamation have to apply. Under the rules of the First Amendment for defamation, injunctions are not available to public officials or public figures.\n Well, so this finding   the court shouldn't have made these findings? It was irrelevant?\n Well, Your Honor, I believe that the  \n Was there an objection to the testimony that established this?\n Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory, who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very outset objected that he was being held liable for speech protected by the First Amendment.\n No, but it seems to me   and I think what bothers me is   is what bothers Justice Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten   that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems to me, is   is something that we   we are not here to touch. That's a question of California law. What we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here   that we have a question about the   the breadth of the case we took. But maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities. But I   I think we're not here to decide whether California could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you agree with that?\n No, Your Honor. I certainly agree with the first point. One issue before this Court is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and whose regulated. But as to the second point that you make, this is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public figure.\n Well, it can certainly   the   the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has   has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question. We may   I'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the   the State of   the courts of California should have reached extortion.\n I would disagree in this way, Your Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate court has to do an independent review of the record.\n With respect to the defamation, pure and simple. I agree with you. We   there is a heightened standard of review, but I don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the State courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.\n But, Your Honor, it was not treated here as an action for extortion or harassment  \n I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does not have a civil action for extortion. It provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that State at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?\n Your Honor, I would say the history of the First Amendment is different. A State can create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any defamation case, somebody might plead something about extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be the norm.\n May I ask this   may I ask this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's office?\n No, Your Honor, because the law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy in defamation cases.\n What's the best authority you have for that proposition?\n Near v. Minnesota would be the best authority where this Court said clearly that injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation case.\n Add to Justice Stevens'   add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.\n But, Your Honor, even   yes, Your Honor. But I don't think that changes the hypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.\n Would you add too that he's judgment-proof?\n Well, again, as I said to Justice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that we allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy people.\n You're saying   you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.\n Well, Your Honor, there are other causes of action that may allow that. If it could be  \n So I'm   my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?\n Not in a defamation action, Your Honor.\n That's  \n I  \n   that's not the question.\n But what is your authority for that proposition?\n Well, I would say that the authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has this Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.\n Have we ever set aside an injunction that did that?\n Well, not under those facts.\n Have we done it either way?\n No. That's correct, Your Honor.\n Have we ever   have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?\n I would say yes, extortion for Austin v. Keith. There was speech to pressure, and yet this Court said even though the speech was to pressure, it's still protected by the First Amendment. I'd like to save the rest of the time for rebuttal, if that's permissible.\n Very well, Mr. Chemerinsky.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court: For years, Mr. Tory has relentlessly targeted Johnnie Cochran with a pattern of defamatory speech in a public forum for purpose of causing Mr. Cochran to pay Mr. Tory money in tribute for ceasing from this unprotected activity. He admitted at trial he intended to engage in this conduct. He was doing it just so he could be paid money, and when asked if he would continue to do so, he stated he would.\n Well, do you   do you defend the injunction in its entirety?\n Yes  \n In other words, the   the   Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to   to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was   quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time. With respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?\n Yes. First of all, I don't believe it was directed to a lot of people. As this  \n Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of   of the named party. So, I   I assume that Mr. Cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.\n I believe this Court said in Madsen that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr. Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for other persons who are not before the court. No aider or abetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms. Craft has never been served with this injunction. Only Mr. Tory. So I don't believe  \n Well, let me ask you a law school question. In   given the injunction on its face, with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to speech in a public place?\n I defend the injunction, and respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is conduct that was being enjoined  \n I   I asked you  \n   from the use of unprotected speech.\n   to exclude the   the issue of conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the injunction that enjoins speech by these people, associates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of the injunction for all time, do you defend that injunction?\n Yes, we defend the injunction.\n Let's take specifically the words of the injunction. It's against orally uttering statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements about Cochran.\n Yes.\n You say that someone can be enjoined  \n Based upon the unique facts of this case, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined. I don't say that in the abstract.\n Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all. I   I mean, the   the injunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of being overly broad.\n But in Near, they set forth certain factors, and those factors included that it was not a private redress of private wrongs. The information was of legitimate public concern. Neither of those elements are present in this action.\n You don't know that.\n You don't  \n You don't know what future speech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know, Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San Francisco. That would be a   a question of public concern.\n But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern of continuing, repetitive conduct.\n Well, what   what you're saying is that an   an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no authority for that proposition.\n I'm not suggesting that this injunction is necessarily overboard based upon that proposition because I believe there are  \n But we have just pointed out that it   that it   it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.\n I disagree with that, Justice Kennedy.\n Well, it does on its face. I mean, it is clearly overbroad. Now, what should we do about that?\n Well, if you're asking me, based upon the breadth of the injunction, what I   if   if there was   are you asking me what I would do to modify the injunction? You could merely strike   you could leave intact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections (ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.\n Now, let   let me ask you about that. Let's   let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the Court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute where we have to save the statute. Do we have any obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why   why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?\n Yes. In   in Madsen, Justice Kennedy, you struck   the Court struck certain provisions as being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain intact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this injunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1. The   they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack paragraph 3. They only level their attack at paragraph 2, and paragraph 2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii), would then be limited to the exact conduct in issue, which is picketing.\n So   so if   before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran. All right. That's what it says. Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart, Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television   do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?\n Absolutely not.\n Absolutely not. Because? Because?\n First of all, that's  \n It said the words. They violated the words. It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?\n Because I don't believe that's a public forum.\n Oh, no, no. He does it in a public forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall. (Laughter.)\n And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a public forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?\n Your   Your Honor, I believe there are alternative channels of communication here.\n No. I thought what you were going to say   but you're not. So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.\n Well, I was  \n But, now, you haven't said that. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it. (Laughter.)\n I think I said it when I said there was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under Pittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct that he has engaged in. And that was clearly the purpose of this injunction, Justice Breyer. We know that. And the purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran.\n In more than one case, we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear and not leaving things to the imagination.\n Well, I think this is precise and clear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's very clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive conduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him  \n Well, it's   it's  \n But nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.\n That's right. It's  \n The injunction just speaks for itself. It doesn't say what   doing what you used to do or anything like that.\n The injunction  \n You cannot picket Cochran or Cochran's law firm. Period.\n If we restricted the injunction to specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief, the response will be that he'll come up with five new words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting  \n Well, maybe there are different grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways to draft it that say no picketing. Period.\n Well, there could be no picketing for purposes of   no   which contains defamatory speech for purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But  \n All I'm suggesting is just draft it   just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely. Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.\n Well, I would disagree based upon the prior   continuing course of   of repetitive conduct and the fact that this   over a period 3 years, once a week, this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr. Cochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles Superior Court. And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a public figure actually favors the breadth of this injunction. If this was not a public figure, then the public forum issue would not be as effective. But because Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets protection is in the public forum because this gentleman could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And that is the problem we were contending with in attempting to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet could control Mr. Tory  \n You   you did draft this injunction. It wasn't the   an inspiration from the judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?\n It  \n This   the terms of this injunction.\n Were aided   were aided by my advocacy, Your Honor.\n Aided and abetted.\n Well said, Justice Rehnquist. What I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran would have been faced with   he has no remedy. Injunctive relief is the only remedy. And he would be faced with a multiplicity of actions  \n Why? Why couldn't he just be enjoined from   from similar defamation? I mean, this   this enjoins him from   from true speech. At least he could   he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that, then   then he could be punished.\n I think we would be   that injunction then would be attacked on being vague or ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say. I guarantee you that was  \n Well, if   if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We   we shouldn't have injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.\n No. I think they can be tailored. I just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this   there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in the least restrictive means. I also continue to advance the argument that this   the facts of this case are unique. It's the use of speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This   this conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The conduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is not protected. If that is not protected, then I believe we can craft  \n You can   you can certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll shoot you. But that   this was a far cry from that. In other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and saying give me something. It's denouncing the victim, which gets into free speech here.\n It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist. But what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr. Cochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions other than to draft the injunction in a form that would preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct without regard to whether it was   and to let him know clearly   give him a safe harbor as to what he could and could not say.\n But the injunction isn't limited to the same conduct.\n But I don't think it needs to be because of the pattern and practice that this man has engaged in over 3 years. And if we take the example, which is so he has a change of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr. Cochran and that's become his   and he's going to promote him as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into the court and modify the injunction.\n I thought he lived in L.A. (Laughter.)\n I think he'd like to get him up to San Francisco. (Laughter.)\n He can certainly seek to modify the injunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent letter brief, there's   California doesn't adopt the collateral bar rule. And therefore, he has a check and balance in this case. Under People v. Gonzales, 12 Cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in the State of California. So in the unlikely event that Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one, and two, in the   in the more unlikely event that someone was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging in protected speech, he could contest, under First Amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in the State of California because the collateral bar rule has no impact.\n Well, I'm   I'm baffled by that. What you're saying is that the injunction   we're just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean anything?\n No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all I'm saying is  \n I   I fell off the track here.\n All I'm   all I'm saying is that if the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive your right to contest. You don't have a right to contest the constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be enforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt proceeding. California does not adopt that rule. Therefore, Mr. Tory can always   if he is engaged in protected speech, he can easily contend  \n Oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at   he's at risk of a contempt citation.\n I don't dispute that.\n I mean, his speech is being chilled with   with respect to protected speech.\n But there's nothing unusual  \n So the collateral bar rule doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt citation.\n He's subject to it, but there's a check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the potential remedy for Mr. Cochran   what   what is going to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs? And if we balance that against the   the breadth of this injunction, I think we have to look at   one of the biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.\n But it would be so easy. I mean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.\n That's exactly  \n And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense. It would violate the First Amendment. But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.\n And I have no dispute with that, Justice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for the injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And you could always remand for further proceedings, consistent with any opinion you would write, that the injunction has to be tailored to   to deal with defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with the intent to extort. And I  \n That's what he's arguing. You're   you're conceding that it's overbroad.\n I'm saying if this Court   well, I'm gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's overbroad.\n Ah, you're very perceptive. (Laughter.)\n And having gleaned that perception, I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on paragraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First Amendment issues. And I think it's important to point out that if we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in this day   modern age  \n You're sort of saying the opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away, has it ever been there?\n It's never been there.\n What are we taking away?\n I   I agree it's never   you've never found it there and you've never said it can't be there.\n How does California work in that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of State law boxes, that California seems to have an action. Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind. It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you have defamation accompanied by extortion   call it whatever you want   an injunction is proper in these circumstances. Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking about this beast in California which uses the word defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues   also finds extortion and therefore issues an injunction.\n Yes, I think that you could limit the injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature designed to extort.\n Would   would that make Mr. Cochran happy? What   what's the big deal about extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you think Mr. Cochran would be any   any happier simply because the guy says I'll   hasn't said I'll stop if you pay me $10,000?\n No, and I think that would be subject to the same injunctive relief. I think this case is unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree, Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I think people would start defaming with impunity.\n You've got to give us some line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto extortion is that   that there's reluctance to say you can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now, what   what limitation do you want to place upon the ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation combined with extortion?\n I don't think you need to place a limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory conduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes on of a   of a business that   a startup company. It can't   damages of   for a startup company   they're very difficult to prove.\n But then you run into the public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation action against a public figure, which they want to say this is. You can write all kinds of things about public figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do   is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation action an injunction?\n There's no authority, but there's no authority that says you can't do it. But what I am suggesting is in   is in a pure defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only way to get that posting off the Internet would be to enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the problem. And if it's   even if it's purely defamatory, you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting, similar to   to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude it. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it in the future.\n But you've just said something that I think that's inconsistent with your earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to enjoin the particular placards that were used, the particular words because then there would be other words. So the same question could come up with an Internet posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was posted but anything about this particular individual that might be posted in the future.\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of balancing about the   how narrowly tailored the injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and, you know   and   and in this   and what test we would analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the Ward test. And   and I think that in applying those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific type of speech or   then that   that would be a   a reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of actions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy for that posting or postings of a similar nature. So  \n Now, you   you   to the extent that you're complaining about extortion-like conduct, something else that you drafted   I'm looking at the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have identified all defamatory, including with the false light invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that looks like blackmail.\n If you'd   if I could direct you, Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of conduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the business of professionally extorting monies from innocent persons and business  \n I   I was going to ask you about that. Were there findings to substantiate the allegations?\n Findings to substantiate  \n Specifically about the extorting money from the bank and the oil company.\n No, Justice Kennedy, there were not.\n No findings.\n There was some testimony only on one of those issues, which was the oil company. There was no findings on this issue. But then I would refer you to paragraph (k) which specifically refers to extorting of monies. And also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the trial's transcript, the   the first thing I said is this is speech designed for an improper purpose. It's unprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran. That was the whole theme  \n But what   what I mean is could you have   without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not looking at your particular allegations but how you described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and invasion of privacy.\n I think we could have pled extortion had we chose to. We could have pled inference with advantageous business relations. We probably could have pled California's  \n Does California law require you to label the type of the cause of action or is it notice pleading based on facts?\n Notice pleading based on facts, but we do label the causes of action. The   the point I'm trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled, if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is not protected. And whether we named the cause of action correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money. We attempted to achieve that. We thought we did a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack and I agree is not fairly included within the question which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the underlying finding. But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr. Tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran. He   and   and this is   one point that I want to stress. We don't view this injunction as being violated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went in the newspapers. We don't view those as public forums under the definition that this Court has provided. Those are not public forums. We are not concerned about that. We do not believe that those events will occur. We did not seek to protect them. So we have given Mr. Tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day. And with that, I would submit that while the injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.\n Thank you. Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about how an opinion might be written, and there are three different ways not mutually exclusive. One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad for all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole said a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can go to court and ask for modification of the injunction, but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr. Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets permission. Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go before the media. However, under California law, under Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public forum. A second way the opinion could be written is that this for speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether that's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion claim.\n Yes, but you're asking us now to   the   the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included in the question presented.\n I think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible. But I go on to the third way that the opinion could be written, and that's that injunctions are not permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can have an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a remedy. But those have specific elements that have to be met. Those elements weren't met in this case. History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow injunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either too narrow or too broad. In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by this Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later than that. To approve an injunction in a case like this, even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in defamation cases across the country. No  \n There have been   there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking.\n Yes, Your Honor, and we have no objection to injunctions of that sort. What we object to is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case and an injunction that is directed at speech. That's what the First Amendment prohibits. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.\n Good morning, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: On the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, there is one evident religious symbol that conveys a powerful religious message that there is a theistic God and that God has committed rules for behavior. Of course, the government may put religious symbols on its property, including the Ten Commandments, but must do so in a way that does not endorse religion or a particular religion, but does not have the purpose of advancing religion, but does not favor any particular religion.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, I suppose that opening statement suggests that you think that Thanksgiving proclamations are also unconstitutional, which were recommended by the very first Congress, the same Congress that proposed the First Amendment.\n No, Your Honor, I would - I'm sorry.\n They also refer to one God, to a theistic ruler of the universe.\n No, Your Honor, I think the Thanksgiving proclamations would be constitutional. I think it's analogous to the legislative prayers that this Court upheld in Chambers v. Marsh. I think it's very different than this Ten Commandments monument.\n All right. But then you have to narrow your opening statement and say that certainly the State can acknowledge the existence of a unitary God without offending the Establishment Clause.\n Yes, Your Honor, but it all depends on how it is done. Here the way in which it is done is the most powerful and profound religious message that this Court has ever considered on government property. Here you have a monument that proclaims not only there is a God, but God has dictated rules for behavior for those who follow him or her.\n I don't know whether that's any more profound or ultra-religious, super-religious than the prayer that the chaplain gives every day in the House.\n Your Honor, there is a difference between a prayer that a chaplain gives   in Chambers v. Marsh, this Court emphasized that the prayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer. This is very much sectarian. This proclaims that there is a God. It proclaims  \n Well, I mean, I haven't read the prayer. So I would be surprised if I went through all the prayers and there was no mention, direct or indirect, of the Ten Commandments or a couple of them.\n Your Honor, I would be surprised because here, if you look at these commandments, it's that God has claimed that he is the only God, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting graven images, prohibiting taking the name of the Lord and God in vain. Requiring observing of the sabbath. This is God dictating to God's followers rules for behavior.\n Is there any other   I mean, you can continue if you want, but one difference which I've written down is you say that the difference between this and the prayer is that this is more profoundly religious. Is there any other difference, in your opinion?\n No. I think the key difference is  \n That's the difference? So if I happen to read these prayers in the Congress and I came to the conclusion that in terms of a religious message, I actually thought the prayers had the more religious message, then I should vote against you.\n No, Your Honor. There are, of course, other differences. As I said to Justice Scalia earlier, with regard to legislative prayer in Chambers versus Marsh, this Court said that there was a history going back to the very first Congress that allowed there to be those kinds of religious invocations. Ten Commandments monuments standing by themselves, as they do here, certainly are not of that historic origin.\n How about if they're packaged in a museum-like setting and there is some interest on the part of the State in preserving something.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n And displaying a whole variety of things?\n Of course, there can be Ten Commandments or any religious works as part of a museum setting. This isn't a museum setting, Your Honor. Every monument on the Texas  \n Is this a kind of a park? What do we regard this space as? What is it? Is it a park-like setting?\n It is a park-like setting. It is the acres of the State Capitol grounds. Every monument on the State Capitol grounds is there because the State legislature wanted to convey a particular message. It is a felony in Texas, an impeachable offense to put anything on the Capitol grounds without the approval of the legislature. Most of the monuments are there to honor war veterans. This is the only religious message anywhere on the Capitol grounds. And by itself  \n Well, would it be all right, in your view, if they put several others up for different religions? Then is it going to be okay?\n If the clear purpose and message was to honor the diversity of religions in Texas, it would then be permissible. If it were a series of displays like that frieze, the fifteen different  \n You don't object to that?\n Quite the contrary, I think it's a  \n Or the depiction on the door of the Court?\n Quite the contrary. This is exactly how the State may display the Ten Commandments.\n But the prayers in Congress don't do that and our Thanksgiving proclamations don't do that. They invoke a God, a unitary God, and that's contrary to the dictates of some religions that believe that there are a lot of gods.\n Yes, Your Honor, there is  \n We don't pray to gods, the prayers are always to God. You know, I don't see why the one is good and the other is bad. It's no answer to say, well, you know, the former has been around for a long time. Well, it has but it suggests what the framers and what our society for several hundred years has believed the Establishment Clause means. And it does not   it is not too sectarian if it invokes a unitary God. Now, you're saying it becomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten Commandments.\n No, Your Honor. I'm saying several things. As I said earlier, first, this Court in Chambers v. Marsh said that there was a unique history to legislative prayers. There isn't a similar history here.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, too, doesn't the venue count? After all, we have had the question of prayer in schools, and the Court has said that that was not all right. Prayer in the legislature was distinguished. So it's not just prayer anywhere that the government wants to have it is okay.\n Of course, Justice Ginsburg, the venue counts. And here the venue is very important. It is the corner between the Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court. And in that way, this monument standing alone does convey the government's endorsement for religion.\n Okay. But if the legislature itself can have its sessions opened with a prayer, can the legislature itself want to have the Ten Commandments posted within the legislative halls?\n Your Honor, I think there is a very different message that's conveyed.\n Can it do that?\n No, Your Honor, it can't post the Ten Commandments by itself in its legislative halls because that would then be the government endorsing expression for support for that message. It cannot be, Your Honor, that just because there is a legislative prayer, that any religious message anywhere on government property would then be permissible. As Justice Kennedy has said in his opinion for  \n But it's so hard to draw that line. If the legislature can open its own sessions attended by the public with a prayer, you say it cannot, in the same building, display the Ten Commandments.\n That's right, because the message from the government is quite different. The message with legislative prayers, as this Court found in Chambers v. Marsh, is a recognition of a long historical practice. But when it comes to the Ten Commandments, it really is different than even a legislative prayer. This declares not only there is a God, but that God has proclaimed rules for behavior. The Ten Commandments come from sacred texts. As Justice Kennedy said in his opinion of County of Allegheny, certainly a city council could not put atop the city hall building a large Latin cross, even if that city council begins every day with a prayer. It cannot be there just because some religious messages are allowed, like a prayer, that everything then becomes permissible.\n Well, you know, in the First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict. A moment's delay in publication is a constitutional crisis. And I'm not sure that we should carry that over to this area, where there is this obsessive concern with any mention of religion. That seems to me to show a hostility to religion. I just don't see a balanced dialogue in our cases or in these kinds of arguments.\n Your Honor, I don't believe there should be an obsessive concern with religion. If the Ten Commandments are displayed as part of an overall display of law givers, like that frieze, it's permissible. But when you put sacred texts somewhere on government property, then the message is that the government is endorsing  \n This is a classic avert your eyes. If an atheist walked by, he can avert his eyes, he can think about something else.\n I don't think so, Your Honor. This Court has said the key is that the government can't endorse religion, in a way that makes some feel like insiders and some like outsiders. Imagine somebody who is Muslim or Buddhist or Hindu  \n May I ask you this question. Supposing   I recently read a case from the Seventh Circuit on what they did in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. And as we all know, this organization has donated Ten Commandments monuments all over the country. And what they did there is they sold the parcel back to the Eagles, their name, and put up a sign which read, this property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the city endorse the religious expression thereon. Now, my question to you is, if there were a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be an adequate remedy, in your view?\n It would be a harder case, but I don't think it would be an adequate remedy. And the reason is the city cannot put a religious symbol standing alone on government property just through disclaimer. That's exactly what County of Allegheny was. There the nativity scene in the courthouse had a plaque saying it was donated by others, but that can't excuse it because otherwise the city could put the large Latin cross just with a disclaimer.\n But if the test is whether the reasonable observer would think that the government is endorsing the religious message, wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the reasonable observer the government was not endorsing the message?\n I think the disclaimer would make it a harder case, but I think when you're dealing with the ground in a Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court, that placement, when you're dealing with the Ten Commandments, sacred texts, I still think that the message the reasonable observer would be that this is the government endorsing religion.\n At some point, would the State's interest in preserving old objects overcome the objection constitutionally?\n Yes, at some point, it could where it was clear to the reasonable observer that it was there because it was an old object.\n How did this monument get there? Was it in   is it true that it was put in as a result of promoting a movie about the Ten Commandments?\n The record is unclear as to that. There are certainly many indications in the popular press that Cecil B. DeMille together with his movie, The Ten Commandments, worked with the Friends of Eagles to have these monuments put around the country. But there is nothing in the legislative history that links this particular monument to that.\n Isn't the display on the tablets on the top before you get to the text, before you get to, I am the Lord, thy God. I thought that those were replicas of what was in the film.\n I don't know that, Your Honor. I've tried to find out what that text is. It is not in Hebrew. It is not in a script that anyone was able to recognize. But it is important to notice that if you look at the entire monument, in addition to the Ten Commandments, there is also a Latin symbol of Christ, there is also Jewish Stars of David. And as I was saying in response to Justice Kennedy's question, imagine the Muslim or the Buddhist who walks into the State Supreme Court to have his or her case heard. That person will see this monument and realize it's not his or her government.\n I thought Muslims accept the Ten Commandments.\n No, Your Honor, the Muslims do not accept the sacred nature of the Ten Commandments, nor do Hindus, or those who believe in many gods, nor of course, do atheists. And for that matter, Your Honor, if a Jewish individual would walk by this Ten Commandments, and see that the first commandment isn't the Jewish version, I am the Lord, thy God, took you out of Egypt, out of slavery, would realize it's not his or her government either.\n You know, I think probably 90 percent of the American people believe in the Ten Commandments, and I'll bet you that 85 percent of them couldn't tell you what the ten are. (Laughter.)\n And when somebody goes by that monument, I don't think they're studying each one of the commandments. It's a symbol of the fact that government comes   derives its authority from God. And that is, it seems to me, an appropriate symbol to be on State grounds.\n I disagree, Your Honor. For the State to put that symbol between its State Capitol and the State Supreme Court is to convey a profound religious message. If you're just saying, now, this isn't there for its secular reason. If someone were to read this monument, one sees that it emphasizes its religious content.\n It is a profound religious message, but it's a profound religious message believed in by the vast majority of the American people, just as belief in monotheism is shared by a vast majority of the American people. And our traditions show that there is nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. I mean, we're a tolerant society religiously, but just as the majority has to be tolerant of minority views in matters of religion, it seems to me the minority has to be tolerant of the majority's ability to express its belief that government comes from God, which is what this is about. As Justice Kennedy said, turn your eyes away if it's such a big deal to you.\n I disagree, Your Honor. Because this Court has said that above all, the government can't make some feel like they're insiders and some like outsiders. Even if they're the majority religion  \n Well, suppose a non-Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious person. Does he feel like an outsider? And to require that we pretend that there is no religious motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part of many of our public officials seems to me to be a hostility toward religion.\n No, Your Honor. Imagine that judge put the Ten Commandments right above his or her bench. That would make some individuals feel like outsiders. Of course, many judges have religious beliefs, but they can't have the religious beliefs above them. And Your Honor, that's not hostility to religion. As this Court said in County of Allegheny, excluding religious symbols like the nativity scene, when displayed by itself, is not hostility to religion. Last year in Locke v. Davie, this Court said that to deny funding through the State of Washington for scholarships was not hostility to religion. Enforcing the Establishment Clause is not about hostility to religion. It is about making sure that every person who walks into that courtroom can feel that it's his or her government.\n That's an important point to me, but I don't see any way to get there in these difficult cases without making a practical judgment about whether that's really so. And the reason I say that, I start with Goldberg's opinion with Harlan in Schempp. And I know there are a lot of others, but I don't know if we've found a satisfactory test. And the point that they make is the government should be noninvolved with the religious, and it can't favor one over the other. But at the same time, we are a religious nation, where most people do believe in God and most of our institutions flow from the religious nature of our people. The City on the Hill, proclaim liberty throughout the land. All of those are religious. So how can the government, without what they call the pervasive and brooding commitment to secularism, which they think would be wrong, become necessarily involved because of our traditions, but not go too far? Now, I come to the conclusion very tentatively, there is no way to do it other than look at the divisive quality of the individual display case by case. And when I do that, I don't find much divisiveness here. Now, I'm exposing the whole thing not because I'm accepting it, but I would love to hear what you think.\n Yes, Your Honor, I think that the test that this Court has formulated do draw those lines. With regard to your point about divisiveness, the Ten Commandments is enormously divisive right now. I don't think we can ignore the social reality. The chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court resigned, there are crowds outside today. I got hate messages this week, not because people care about the Ten Commandments as a secular document, but people care about the Ten Commandments because it's a profound religious message. And many want that religious message on government property. And I'm saying the government can put the Ten Commandments there as part of an overall display of law givers, because, Justice O'Connor, it's an overall display about diversity of religion. But when the Ten Commandments sits by itself it is, to use your word right now, enormously divisive. And that's why, from that criteria, it does violate the Establishment Clause.\n What about the opening of this Court's session today, in a manner that has been used since John Marshall, is that divisive because there are a lot of people who don't believe in God.\n But You Honor, I think that you have to distinguish between minimal religious content and maximum religious content.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, on that point, how much of the Ten Commandments   I mean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder, then there are tenets to govern a society, but how much are strictly about the obligation that man owes to God?\n The first of the two tablets, the first five commandments, Your Honor, and of course religions belief this was written in God's own hand and given to Moses. It's believed that the first five commandments that you were referring to are God's prescriptions for religious behavior. The latter five, the others that you're referring to, were God's commands for secular behavior. All of these are God's commands to God's people. And that's what makes it different than the minimal religious content of God save this Honorable Court that Justice Scalia was referring to. The core of Texas's argument seems to be that it's there for secular purposes. But of course, if one looks at this monument, one sees that it's emphasizing the religious content and there is nothing that would lend the reasonable observer to see the secular content. It says in large letters, I am the Lord, thy God.\n Well, suppose, Mr. Chemerinsky, it was like Moses on that frieze where there are commandments showing, but there are only the sixth through tenth commandment. Would that be all right?\n Your Honor, if it was like Moses on that frieze together with fourteen other symbols, absolutely okay, because it would clear to the reasonable observer  \n But if we just had the Moses with the tablet that has the instructions for how people will conduct themselves in a civilized society versus worshiping the Lord.\n I think that would still be unconstitutional between the Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court because it would still be the State of Texas expressing the message that there is a God and that God has dictated these rules for behavior.\n Okay, what if you go one step further and there was simply a tablet without any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera, basically just the last five commandments, pure and simple. Would you have any objection on Establishment Clause grounds?\n If the tablets were by themselves in that way, between the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas State Capitol, it would be a harder case, but I believe it would still be unconstitutional because those tablets do convey a message that God  \n No, I'm just talking about when I   I don't know if I used the word tablet. I'm just talking about a piece of stone or a 10 poster that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not 11 covet, thou shalt not bear false witness, et cetera. Would there be any Establishment Clause 13 objection simply because though it does not say so, those 14 were quotations from the last six commandments - last five commandments.\n No, Your Honor. If all 16 it said was thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not 17 steal, I don't think that that would be a problem 18 because, of course, those are a reflection of law.\n Who are you kidding? I 20 mean, everybody knows that comes from the Ten 21 Commandments. And what that message says is that 22 these commands that are engraved on the human heart 23 come from God. Why put it that way? You know, 24 instead of that, just quote the State statute against 25 murder. That's not what they're doing. They're saying these basic principles of human behavior that we're governed by come from God. And that message would be conveyed so long as you use the terminology of the Ten Commandments. That's what the Ten Commandments stand for.\n But Your Honor, this Court has emphasized that content and context matter enormously. And what I'm trying to do is to distinguish the situation where in Texas, it was clearly tablets with the words, I am the Lord, thy God, with five commandments for religious behavior and five for secular behavior. From Justice Souter's question, there are five others and especially those that are reflected in State law, like thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not steal. I think that the message is different there. It is the words, I am the Lord, thy God.\n I think you're telling us that the State cannot accommodate religion. The only way they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up and insist that it's always secular, whether it's predominantly for a secular purpose. It seems to me that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people to surrender their beliefs and that is not accommodation.\n No, Your Honor. I do think that it degrades religion to have to have the Ten Commandments defended for their secular purpose. I do think, though, that what's required of the government, when it puts religious symbols on government property, is to not be endorsing religion. That's why a nativity scene by itself in the County of Allegheny case was unconstitutional. On the other hand, that's why the nativity scene as part of a unified display in Lynch v. Donnelly was permissible. That's why, if the Ten Commandments are part of an overall display like this frieze, it's permissible. If it's part of an overall display about religious tolerance, and that's what the reasonable observer would see, it is permissible. But where it is the Ten Commandments themselves, placed as they are here, then it really is about the government endorsing religion, then it is the purpose of advancing religion and then it does violate the Establishment Clause.\n So the word accommodate should not be within our jurisprudence?\n Accommodate should very much be in the jurisprudence. And any time there is a Free Exercise Clause claim, then there has to be careful attention to accommodating religion. But there is no Free Exercise Clause claim in this case, Your Honor, so this isn't a case about accommodating anybody's religious beliefs. This is about the State expressing support for religion with sacred and solemn religious texts on government property. And my position is  \n Can the State express its support for religion generally?\n Your Honor, it would all depend\n Suppose it didn't have the Ten Commandments, it just had a big thing that says religion is good. It said religion is the foundation of our institutions. Suppose there were something like that. Would that be bad?\n I don't think that would be a problem under the Establishment Clause because it's minimal  \n But there are atheists who disagree with that intensely.\n But Your Honor, I'm not arguing for a heckler's veto by atheists. What I am saying is that when the government puts sacred and solemn texts taken directly from the Bible at the core of its State government, it has to then do something to convey the message that it's not there for religious purposes, that it's there for secular purposes.\n Doesn't it matter whether that text has acquired an independent meaning of its own? As I say, I don't think most people know what the text of the Ten Commandments are, but they do know that it stands for the fact that our laws are derived from God. That's what it stands for. Why isn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the State of Texas to use it?\n The Ten Commandments monument by itself conveys the message that the Ten Commandments are the source of law and it's that message the State can't convey. May I save the rest of the time for rebuttal?\n Yes, you may save your time.\n Thank you.\n General Abbott, we'll hear for you, please.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Every court that has reviewed the specific facts of this case has agreed that the Texas monument is constitutional under this Court's well settled precedents in Lynch and Allegheny. This Court should agree that the Texas monument should not be torn down from its historical place for three reasons. First, the Ten Commandments is an historically recognized symbol of law. Second, this monument is one of the smallest of the 17 monuments on the Capitol grounds, and like most of the other monuments, was a gift to the State of Texas and is clearly recognized as such on the monument itself. And third, this monument has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national historic landmark. In fact, even the  \n May I ask you this question? Under your analysis of the reason this is justifiable, would it equally be permissible to have a crucifix of the same size in the same location on the Capitol grounds?\n Justice Stevens, I think that would pose a much greater problem.\n That's not my question. Do you think it would be permissible   it seems to me your reasoning that you've given us would support that result. And maybe that's the correct result. I'm wondering what your view is.\n I seriously question whether or not a crucifix would be constitutionally acceptable in that same location, and for the very same reasons which I'm articulating why the Ten Commandments would be acceptable in this location. The crucifix is not like the Ten Commandments in that it's not an historically recognized symbol of law. It doesn't send a secular message to all the people, regardless of whether or not they are believers or not believers of the important role the Ten Commandments have played in the development of law.\n It's not a secular message. I mean, if you're watering it down to say that the only reason it's okay is it sends nothing but a secular message, I can't agree with you. I think the message it sends is that law is   and our institutions come from God. And if you don't think it conveys that message, I just think you're kidding yourself.\n Well, Justice Scalia, the Ten Commandments send both a religious message and a secular message. When people  \n But the district court, I think in this very case, found that commemorating the Ten Commandments' role in the development of secular law was not one of the State's purposes in accepting the monument. Now, will you accept that finding as the case comes to us? That hasn't been challenged. We don't have any cross appeal. I assume we accept that finding of the district court.\n The Court obviously is correct to accept that finding. As you know, from the district court's finding, the secular purpose that was accepted by the district court was to honor the Fraternal Order of Eagles. But also there was an ongoing  \n But you're arguing for something contrary to the district court's finding.\n I'm actually, Justice O'Connor, arguing for purposes that are in addition to that district court's finding because there was an ongoing purpose to retain this now historical monument that has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national and historic landmark.\n So in another case, if a government official feels that the Ten Commandments have been very, very important in his or her life as a spiritual or religious matter and wants other people to know how important the Ten Commandments are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten Commandments. And so you can have no Ten Commandments in city A, but the Ten Commandments in city B. General, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. And again, you're just doing with purpose what you did in response to Justice Scalia's question. You're asking us to ignore the religious purpose that is the most manifest value of these symbols.\n Well, with regard to both purpose and effect in this particular setting, I don't think that religion was the driving force. I know that all of the evidence shows that religion was not a driving force in any respect.\n I suppose that every monument that's on the State Capitol grounds in Texas in a sense conveys a message of State endorsement, State endorsement of the role of servicemen in fighting earlier wars or in support of the Boy Scouts or whatever it might be, doesn't it? I mean, by placing them there with the legislative approval, is that not really some kind of a message of endorsement for each one?\n If I may clarify an important fact and that is clearly the State of Texas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum-like setting on the Capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge and commemorate certain events. It's important for the Court to remember, though, that the State of Texas has specifically endorsed nine of those monuments by putting the State seal or the Lone Star seal for the State of Texas on those nine monuments. This monument does not have that kind of endorsement on there.\n Isn't it all the case, as has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the approval of the legislature? You don't dispute that, do you?\n Not at all. That is very true.\n And you don't dispute that anyone going on those grounds would assume that the State government approved it or it wouldn't be there?\n Justice Souter, of course the presumption would be that people on the Capitol grounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those monuments on the Capitol grounds.\n Well, I'm not sure that that endorsement   in England, there is a square where they have King Charles on one hand   on one end and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded him, on the other. I don't know if you have to endorse one or the other.\n Well, Justice Kennedy, I believe that there is a very meaningful difference between this Court's standards of an endorsement and what a State or the nation may do with regard to commemoration. As an easy example, on the National Mall, there is, of course, the Lincoln Memorial and in the Lincoln Memorial, there is text from the King James version of the Bible. The nation commemorates and acknowledges Lincoln and what he has said. But by that display, the United States is not trying to endorse the King James version of the Bible or a particular religious message in that. Instead what the state\n But you have to contend with the fact that the district court found that this sort of commemoration of the Commandments involved was not the objective in placing the monument there, so you're left basically with a religious text. And if anybody has any doubt about that, the religious text is surrounded by some religious symbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David. So it seems to me that it's hard to find, if we accept the district court findings, that there's anything here but an expression of approval by the State of Texas for a religious expression, and only for the religious expression.\n Sir, all other factors, though, Justice Souter, as a person who stands in front of that monument clearly recognizes, centered in a specialized scroll is an indication that this was a monument that was dedicated and presented to the people and the youth of the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. There is no stamp of approval on this by the State of Texas on that monument.\n But you're not trying to withdraw the   I took it to be the concession that of course anyone would reasonably assume that the State of Texas approved this message, and thought it was appropriate to devote state property to its promulgation.\n Clearly the State of Texas approved of the monument being on the grounds  \n But then the fact that the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very far, does it?\n Well, where I believe it gets you, as this Court has recognized, there is a very meaningful difference between acknowledging something and endorsing something. For example, the creche in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny.\n Let me ask you this. If the Eagles' presentation statement weren't on there, would that make a difference to Establishment Clause analysis?\n I think that the Eagles' disclaimer on there helps our case, but if it were not on there, I think the monument could still stand just as the creche did in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny. The city of Pawtucket was not endorsing the creche in the display, it was acknowledged as part of the overall holiday celebration.\n What is the   that's one of the problems with the argument, it seems to me, that by putting the Ten Commandments monument on grounds that have lots of other monuments, that the religious message is somehow either diluted or changed. Contrast the situation in Texas with what we've got here. You've got Moses up there with at least the last five commandments showing. But Moses is in the company of a group of individuals who are nothing but law givers. You've got Menes and Hammurabi and John Marshall and the rest of them. There is an obvious theme. Anybody who looks at the identity   or knows the identity of these figures is saying they're getting at law givers. But if you look at the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, you see wars, pioneer women, children and so on. There is no one common theme. The only theme seems to be these are objects or symbols that are worthy of some kind of respect. And one of them is religious. Being mixed into a group that has no common theme does not eliminate the religious   the obvious religious message from this monument. Isn't that correct?\n Well, just as this Court may display in the courtroom itself, Moses with the Ten Commandments amongst law givers, doesn't mean that that is the only way the Ten Commandments  \n Maybe it doesn't, but I'm trying to find a rationale for the argument that's being made, and that I thought you were alluding to. The argument is that by mixing this in with a grab bag of other symbols, you have somehow diluted or changed the focus from a religious message to something else. And I can understand that in the Moses case in the frieze because there is a clear common theme. On the Texas grounds, at least insofar as I can tell, there is no common theme. There are a series of objects that say, these are worthy of veneration. One of them is religious. There is nothing that removes the religious message from its prominence in the display the way the religious message is removed from prominence in the Moses display, isn't that correct?\n Your Honor, if I may explain with two points. One, there is a common theme on the Texas Capitol grounds, just as there are on most Capitol grounds and on the National Mall. And the common theme is to recognize historical influences in our country and in our State.\n But what do you do with the district court finding?\n Well, the district court finding obviously chose to decide that the secular purpose for the display was to honor the Fraternal Order of Eagles for their commitment to combating juvenile delinquency. But that is different   the purpose why the district court found why the display was constitutional is different than the message that is being sent to the reasonable observer.\n You had a second point and I don't want to miss your second point.\n The second point is that there are other displays in this Court. As a person walks into this courtroom or exits the courtroom, they don't see the Ten Commandments in a display with a bunch of law givers. Instead, they see the Ten Commandments alone with an eagle above it.\n They see blank tablets. They don't see any writing. This is the only one that has script on it. It has numbers and in fact that's confusing because one of them, the people think is the Ten Commandments is the Bill of Rights. (Laughter.)\n Justice Ginsburg, clearly the Ten Commandments that are reflected on the doorway into and out of this courtroom don't have words on them like the tablets do in the State of Texas.\n But we know what they are, don't we?\n We do and that's the point. Even more importantly, the reasonable observer knows what  \n But do we know which version of the Ten Commandments it stands for? There are three different versions at least.\n I happen to agree with the Petitioner. There is more than three versions of the Ten Commandments. And the purpose, if you go back to what the Eagles were trying to achieve here, was to come up with a version of the Ten Commandments that wasn't reflective of any particular religion.\n And it doesn't matter what the version is, does it? If it just stands for the fact that laws   the foundation of our laws is God. If that's all it stands for, who cares what the text is.\n General Abbott, would the Texas purpose be equally served if the monument had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in Wisconsin put on its monument?\n Justice Stevens, I apologize, I'm not familiar with that disclaimer.\n It reads this way. What they did is they sold the parcel of land that had the Eagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and then they put a fence around it and then they put this sign up, \"This property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse the religious expression thereon.\" Maybe as long as it's still on the property, it couldn't be the same. But suppose you had a comparable disclaimer. Would that defeat any of the purposes on which you relied to justify having the statue there?\n A disclaimer like that would surely ensure that this display is constitutional. However, it's our contention  \n And would it undermine the message that you legitimately seek to convey?\n I don't believe it would.\n Well, why don't you do it and we wouldn't have this case? I really would consider it something of a Pyrrhic victory if you win on the ground that you're arguing. So that in all future cases, we're going to have to examine displays of the Ten Commandments to see whether there was ever any intent to say that our laws are ultimately dependent upon God. Is that what you want us to do case by case?\n Well, this Court obviously has decided Establishment Clause cases on a case-by-case basis, but in this particular instance, the Ten Commandments displayed in a museum-like setting on the Capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other monuments, the message that is received by the viewer who is trekking through the Capitol grounds looking at monuments is clearly one not of the State of Texas.\n I've got to get one question before you leave because you're the one who knows the record. And what I've had a hard time finding in the record is what I think there must be some material that the State or somebody in a tourist office or a guide or somebody tells people what the 17 different monuments are. And all I've found is the general brochure which doesn't tell them what they are. And I found something on the Internet. Well, which is in the record. But aside from this page from the Internet in the record and that, is there anything else in this record that if somebody wanders around, they're on the State grounds, they say, what is this, what are these things anyway? There must be something that tells them. And where is it?\n The state provides a walking tour guide.\n And the brochure doesn't tell what they are. This thing, it says grounds?\n Your Honor, Justice Breyer, if I could refer you to page 205 of the Joint Appendix, it provides a description of each of the monuments on the walking tour. And if I could also refer the Court to page 117 of the Joint Appendix, it shows the actual walking tour where a person would go along the process of seeing the monuments. But clearly as they walk through the Capitol grounds, what any observer, not just the reasonable observer, what any observer would notice is that before they could even get to this particular monument, they will have passed in full view of countless other monuments and historical markers clearly indicating to them that they are not there for the purpose of seeing just the Ten Commandments but they are in a museum-like setting cast among many different kinds of monuments. And so they appreciate the setting before they even arrive at the Ten Commandments monument. Also when they arrive at the Ten Commandments monument, they will notice it is one of the smallest of the monuments on the Texas Capitol grounds. It does have the disclaimer on it indicating that it was donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. It does not have the State seal on it like many of the other monuments, so it's not  \n Is it like how many other monuments? This is not peculiar to Texas. The Order of the Eagles have given how many monuments just like this one, identical to this one?\n Justice Ginsburg, it is actually not clear from the record. There have been some accounts of hundreds, maybe even into the thousands that the Fraternal Order of Eagles have given out. And I cannot tell you for a fact that they are all identical.\n When you said that every court that has considered this case has said it's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did you mean just this Texas case or other cases involving an Eagles Ten Commandments?\n Justice Ginsburg, my reference was to the fact that every case that has considered the specific   every court that has considered the specific facts of this case, meaning the Texas case  \n So you didn't mean this particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?\n No, Your Honor. What I meant is that both the district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals specifically reviewed the facts of this case and were all in complete agreement that the facts of this case render this monument constitutional under this Court's well settled precedents in Lynch and Allegheny. One other thing I would like to draw the Court's attention to that will give you a very well understanding of what the monument looks like and its setting is the videotape that is Exhibit 44, it's obviously not part of the Joint Appendix, but it demonstrates how this particular monument is set in a museum-like setting amongst many other monuments and gives you the perspective of what the typical viewer would appreciate as they walk around the Capitol grounds.\n Kind of an eclectic museum. One message that you get is that the State is honoring the donor of the various  \n General Abbott, I want to thank you for your argument and also for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to a fine job. Thank you.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n Mr. Clement.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance, but they also have secular significance as a code of law and as a well-recognized historical symbol of the law. When a State decides to display a Ten Commandments display along with more than a dozen other monuments on its Capitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is not endorsing the religious text of the Ten Commandments. And in the same way, when a state has that monument as part of such a collection, the Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to force them to send a message of hostility to religion by singling out that one monument for removal solely because of its religious content.\n Mr. Clement, can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case? As I understand it, it's the Protestant version basically of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has significant differences from the Catholic version and the Jewish version. And I understand it was the result of consultation and so forth. But I noticed in your brief, you list the States in which the Ten Commandments displays are listed, there is none for Rhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts is a frieze on the north wall of the public library which apparently didn't have the text of the commandments in it. Is there any significance to the fact that this kind of display may be more popular in areas of the country where the Protestant religion is dominant as opposed to other versions of Christian religions?\n Justice Stevens, I don't think so. I mean, we didn't purport to do an exhaustive survey, but I think there is a well-represented group of displays throughout the country including, I think, in States that probably have relatively high Catholic populations. But I think we would steer this Court away from attributing too much significance to the fact that if a State is going to display the Ten Commandments at all, it will necessarily have to display a version that reflects one or another sect's preferences. I mean, in the Marsh case, for example, this Court upheld legislative prayer. It understood that they would necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that chaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or another. And this Court didn't doom the whole practice of legislative prayer because of the necessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination or another. In fact, in the Marsh case itself, this court upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they had chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 16 straight years. And so I don't think this Court in other Establishment Clause contexts has steered away from putting the States and municipalities in a catch-22. And given that this Court has suggested even in Stone against Graham that the Ten Commandments can be displayed, can be used in certain settings, it can't be that once the State in practice picks a particular version, it's all of a sudden guilty of a sectarian preference.\n Of course, the other thing that was notable about your listing is most of the examples are examples of displays of the event itself rather than the text. And there is an argument made I think by Professor Laycock that when you display the entire text, it's kind of a different sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic presentation.\n Well, Justice Stevens, I think there are quite a few of both types of displays and I think the very fact that the Fraternal Order of Eagles put a lot of these displays out suggests that a bunch of them are textual displays. I'm not sure, though, that a display that actually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God is any less religious. I would suggest that's actually more religious than one that just displays the monument standing alone. If the monuments are standing alone, you can I think appreciate the fact that maybe they're being displayed for their secular significance as well as their religious significance. When Moses is there, it's hard to avoid the implication that they are the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a secular code. So in that sense, I'm not sure that the variations in the display  \n You think just a symbolic display is less objectionable than quoting the text as this monument does?\n Well, Justice Stevens, I would say   my point is not that there are not other ways to display it. I mean, certainly I think, as we point out in our brief, blank tablets or tablets with Roman numerals are less objectionable   certainly, I don't think they're beyond objection   than a textual display. My point was that I'm not quite sure how one would balance sort of four Commandments and Moses versus all Ten Commandments in text. I think it's a close call.\n Well, except the four Commandments and Moses would avoid the differences between the three different versions of the Ten Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must select one over the other two.\n Well, I guess I'm not sure that's true. I mean, some of the displays that are out there in courthouses have Moses receiving the Commandments and have text. And I guess, my point, though, would be, again  \n Most of them don't.\n To be sure, to be sure. But I would hope the constitutional line wouldn't be that you can't have text. I mean, the Ten Commandments have a role in our society and had an influence on the development of the law as text. I mean, you know, they weren't influential with ten Roman numbers. They were influential as text.\n General Clement, there is a question I have about the government's position. And does place matter at all? I mean, here we're talking about the grounds surrounding a State Capitol. What about every school room, if that's the choice of the school board? Is it the same or do you make   or every courtroom up to the court to decide for itself?\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think location and context matters. I think in almost every Establishment Clause context, the setting and context matters a great deal. The school case, for example, as you suggest, I mean, unless this Court is going to revisit Stone against Graham, it's certainly true that the school context at least raises much more difficult questions. In terms of where it can be displayed in a courthouse, I think there are certainly permissible displays in the courthouse, but it may be something all together different to have a display in a way that it actually looks like a religious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.\n It looks just like this monument. Let's take this monument and put it in the rotunda of the court because the judges of that court choose to have it there. Is that all right?\n Justice Ginsburg, I think putting it in the rotunda of the court as a stand-alone monument, giving it sort of pride of place, if you will, raises a much more difficult question, to be sure, and may well cross the constitutional line. As I was alluding to, the one case I'm familiar with, which is the case of the Alabama Supreme Court, there it was displayed in a way that the district court literally found it was like a religious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.\n And do you think that it should cross the constitutional line under the interpretational theory of the First Amendment you wish us to adopt?\n I think the display that I have in mind in the Alabama Supreme Court probably does cross the constitutional line even under our view. I think that a display of the Ten Commandments in some appropriate way in the courthouse certainly wouldn't cross the line that this Court   that we would have this Court draw. I mean, we think, for example, it cannot be that the very fact that moving it closer to the courthouse itself is a constitutional problem because as you yourself have pointed out, Justice Kennedy, the legislative prayers that were approved in Marsh v. Chambers were at the absolute epicenter of the government. And still those were a permissible acknowledgment of religion. So I think while context matters, I don't think solely the fact that it's moved closer to the seat of government does have a dispositive impact. And again, I would say in response to Justice Stevens' question, I do think it is important to remember that there is going to have to be a choice among the various documents if they are going to be displayed at all. And I don't think that the Constitution puts the municipalities and the States in the bind of being able to display the Ten Commandments in theory, but in fact, not being able to pick any one version  \n What would your comment be on requiring a disclaimer of some kind?\n Well, Justice Stevens, two points to make about that. One is certainly a disclaimer would make this an easier case. And I would point out that there is a disclaimer of sorts on the monument already because it clearly states that it was a gift from the Fraternal Order of Eagles.\n It is kind of ambiguous.\n It is, Justice Stevens, and I'm troubled frankly by the suggestion that they would have to go as far as you suggested they would go under the City of Lacrosse case. The idea that in order to have the Ten Commandments monument on the Capitol grounds, the State of Texas has to cordon that monument off, unlike any other of the 17 monuments, suggests a hostility to religion. I think the idea that there has to be a fence away from the Ten Commandments to make clear that the State has nothing to do with the Ten Commandments is bending over too far in the other direction. The State can have, as this Court has acknowledged many times, permissible acknowledgments of religion. And I don't think in this case that the State of Texas has gone too far. One other point I think that is important to put on the table, and it is consistent with the analysis of both the district court and the Fifth Circuit, is that whatever the original purpose is for Texas accepting the monument and displaying it in the first instance, they now have an additional secular purpose in retaining the monument. And I would point this Court to Judge Becker's analysis in the Chester County case for the Third Circuit. In that case, he had a display that was admittedly smaller, but it was actually a much more overtly sectarian version of the Ten Commandments. It had the Ten Commandments plus the summary of the Ten Commandments from the New Testament. And nonetheless, Judge Becker said that in that case, the monument had been there since 1920 and Chester County had a legitimate secular purpose in maintaining that document and maintaining the plaque on the courthouse. And I think he correctly understood that in these cases of displays that have stood for 40 years or longer, that the State is in something of a dilemma. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, you have four minutes left.\n Thank you. This case comes down to two questions. First, is the Ten Commandments a highly religious message. And second, can the government place a single religious message on government property at the seat of its government. As to the first question, Stone v. Graham resolves this because this Court said that the Ten Commandments is an inherently religious message no matter what disclaimer accompanies it. The Ten Commandments is not on the Texas State Capitol grounds simply to recognize the role of religion in government. It is not simply an acknowledgment. It is sacred text taken directly from the Bible. It's not there about the history of religion in Texas. There is nothing that would tell the reasonable observer that it is there for historical purposes. It isn't there for history. What about all the other religions that have played a role in Texas history? The Muhammad religion, even Madeleine Murray O'Hare. Is Texas saying they would accept statues for all of these individuals there as part of the history of Texas? The second question is, can the government place a single religious message by itself on government property, especially at the seat of government. The County of Allegheny case resolves that. This is much like the nativity scene at the seat of the county government. What's important and hasn't gotten enough emphasis this morning, this is the sole religious message anywhere on the Texas State Capitol grounds. This isn't a museum. Every item that's there is there because the Texas legislature chose to put it there. Most of them honor veterans of particular wars. Texas put this there precisely to express the religious message. Your Honors, what's left of the Establishment Clause if any item can be displayed with the most profound religious contents? Do we then say the observer can just avert his or her eyes? The observer could have averted his or her eyes in the County of Allegheny case. But this Court was clear in saying that a single religious message, a single religious symbol on government property is inherently an establishment of religion. For this reason, the Texas monument violates the Establishment Clause. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The relevant language of the 1963 contract, as illuminated in the surrounding circumstances, was confirmed in the express terms of the 1986 stipulated judgment which commanded the district and the United States to perform the contract. In particular, the first sentence of paragraph 4.2, which is at joint appendix page 111, states   and I quote   the district acknowledges that it entered into the 1963 contract for the benefit of Areas 1A and 1B. That's the premerger  \n Mr. Smiland, do you mind telling us why the petitioners never filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims?\n Yes, Your Honor. There's a long history of litigation here. It began with the first suit in 1979. We were in the district court there. There were administrative and constitutional and equitable issues as well, and we were able in that initial case to combine all those forms of relief in the district court. And then, of course, we got this judgment that I began to read from. And from then on, we had four or five other cases all in the district court. We do acknowledge that on the breach of contract, there is concurrent jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.\n Is it concurrent? I mean, the   the statute I'm reading, the one you brought is consent is given to join the United States as a necessary party defendant. Is that what happened here? They were joined as a necessary party defendant?\n Well, we think so, Your Honor.\n They were? I   I think that's   isn't that   what rule of   I thought there's a   a Rule of Federal Procedure. I can't remember what   what's the  \n Rule 19(s)?\n Yes. Is that what they were joined under?\n That   that procedure was not invoked here.\n No. Well, all right. Were they   there's technical phrase well known in the law to be joined as a necessary party defendant. Given the normal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is that what happened here?\n No. What happened   what happened  \n No, okay. If it did not happen, then how could you possibly sue in that court rather than the Court of Claims where the statute says you can sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?\n Because the waiver of sovereign immunity statute says in any suit.\n It doesn't mean in any suit in sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1? Does it mean any suit in the universe? Any suit in the world? Any tort suit? I would have thought that sentence 2 refers to sentence 1.\n Well, it   it does and that case was litigated against the United States by my clients and   and we won in the Peck case. And we think that should have ended the matter.\n But don't   how can we, if we have   if   if I read this   this as meaning technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter, how could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of Claims, you're in the wrong court?\n Any suit is also in the first sentence, Your Honor.\n Yes. It says  \n And   and  \n   in any suit you can join the United States as a necessary party.\n The   the   in the sue and be sued cases, this Court construes that very broadly, and this is the same root word and  \n Well, but we don't give broad construction to waivers of sovereign immunity.\n I  \n Quite the reverse. And it says to join the U.S. as a necessary party defendant in a suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity in the United States regarding any contract executed pursuant. Now, I guess the farmers were not technically the contracting entity.\n They were not the signing  \n No.\n   party.\n So you've got more problems.\n Our   our argument   and again, this has been resolved in the lower courts against the Government. But our   our view is that by the nature of the intended beneficiary doctrine, the duty is owed to the third party, as well as to the promisee, and it's enforceable by the third party, as well as the promisee.\n If you   if the lower courts were of this view, why did the district court in this case give you three opportunities to have your contract claim transferred to the Claims Court?\n Once the determination was made that we were not intended third party beneficiaries, that was the law of the case, and had it been transferred to the Claims Court, we   we would have been bound by that determination. We felt we had to bring to a final resolution the   the intended beneficiary issue before we could proceed in the Claims Court either.\n But it does suggest that the district court had at least some concern whether the case   your claim had been lodged in the right court.\n Yes, although again that   that court had been hearing these matters for many years in   in numerous cases without this issue ever having come up.\n Well, but it's a   see, I want to know what I'm supposed to do. As I read the language, you're out. As I understand the purpose of the statute, it makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make sense to me if you're in. And maybe there's some lower court precedent to the contrary, which I'd certainly read, but is there any Supreme Court precedent to the contrary that supports you?\n Just the   the language of in any suit definitely is  \n No, no. But that isn't the limiting part. The limiting part is in any suit of a certain kind.\n Yes.\n What they give consent to is joinder as a necessary party. And that is not what happened here.\n Only the   the general principle that language should be read in its ordinary meaning  \n It's ordinary meaning, you're out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary party is you weren't joined as a  \n There   there at least is no evidence that Congress had rule 19 in mind when it enacted either the '52 statute or the '82 statute that we   we stand on.\n Well, it's something that I hadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that, well, if you're transferred to the Court   to the Court of Claims, that you bring with you all of the previous rulings of the United States district court in California and that those are somehow binding because of the law of the case   what is the authority for that? The   the court that's transferred has to accept all the rulings that have been made previous to the transfer?\n I   our understanding is if, obviously  \n I mean, what's the authority for that?\n I can't cite you authority, Your Honor, but I   we were very concerned about that. If there was no waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, then the lower court's ruling on intended third party beneficiary I would think should be vacated.\n Could I   I   I guess I'm not following this. I don't know why, Mr. Smiland, you   you have not referred to the last sentence of   of what you assert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. Why isn't that what you're relying on?\n It is and   and when I was talking about in any suit  \n How does that help you? Because it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of course, this section starts off by talking about addition of a person as a necessary party. So how does the last sentence help you?\n I   I  \n Well, it   it   if the words, join necessary, limit any suit and the language that Justice Scalia referred to, then   then maybe we're in trouble. But otherwise  \n I   I take that to mean that when you sue one defendant and you also sue the United States as a necessary party defendant, that suit   any   that would be a suit pursuant to this section. I   I don't know what other meaning that   that sentence could have. When you sue two parties, one of whom is the United States, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party defendant, that suit is a suit pursuant this section and it can be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. I   I don't know what   what other suit that   that sentence could refer to.\n You   you agree with that. I   you're caught in between us here, and I understand. (Laughter.)\n And I guess we have to figure out what is the right meaning of that initial phrase.\n Perhaps you can explain. This was not your suit originally. You intervened. Right? This was started out by the water district.\n The district sued the United States. We intervened.\n And then after some, I think, 2 years  \n Yes.\n   the water district bows out. It has settled its case. It's a mystery what it settled for. At least, I didn't see it in any of the briefs. Why did the water district, having brought this case, then say, we're satisfied, we're out?\n The record is very sparse, Your Honor. There is the district's motion which says pretty much what it said in its brief, that there was a   a thing called the principles between it and the United States and various parties. And as a result of those principles, which are not in the record, although they are a matter of public record, the   the district in its discretion elected to dismiss the case. We opposed that. We would have hoped the district would have kept going. We lost that opposition. The district was dismissed, and we were allowed to proceed on our own.\n Mr. Smiland, can I ask this question? If Justice Breyer is   the thrust of his question is right, I   I think the district itself could not have brought the suit under his reading of the sovereign immunity. And I'm just wondering, has the United States ever taken the position that the district could not have initiated this litigation?\n Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.\n Could   could we hear your argument on   on the sovereign immunity point as opposed to the venue point? What   on what ground do you say the United States has waived its   its immunity from suit in this case?\n There are two statutes.\n May   may we just back up to the question   your answer to Justice Stevens? I thought that this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water district for money damages. I thought they were seeking declaratory relief against the United States.\n They pled both, Your Honor. Although at that time the water still was available for delivery, it hadn't flowed to the ocean. And the money had not yet been collected and spent. So the focus initially was on equitable relief to stop  \n Because one could   one could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for declaratory relief but not encompassing damages.\n Both statutes we cite say that judgments can be entered in the same manner, to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, language I believe from the Federal Tort Claims Act. Again, both in the 491 F.Supp. decision under the McCarran Act and in the Peck case, the district court held that money damages were encompassed by that. So both statute   statutes on which we rely have language in it taken from other sources of law, with which this Court is very familiar and has opined on several times. The   the only unique parts of   of either of the two statutes that we stand on are   are the rights. One refers to administering a previously adjudicated right to the use of water, and the other is the contract language we've discussed.\n Can you turn to sovereign immunity now?\n Yes.\n And   and let me make   make it easy for you. Do you know of any case, other than cases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a suit has been allowed against the United States based on nothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary of a contract to which the United States has   on which the United States has agreed to be sued? Is   is there any such case?\n No.\n And   and you think it's clear that   as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such a third party beneficiary can sue the United States?\n For example, in the U.S. v. District Court case decided by this Court in 1971, under the McCarran Act, that fact situation was not before you, but the Court did say that the rights to which the statute referred were all inclusive. It read it broadly.\n I   I don't understand that. The rights were all inclusive. As   as I understand the law of third party beneficiaries, it   it used to be   and   and perhaps at the time this statute was enacted still was   quite   quite restrictive. It's only in more recent   I don't agree with the Government's argument that   that you have to, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third party beneficiary's rights. But when sovereign immunity is at issue, it's   it's a different question, it seems to me.\n Well, we have explicit rights here and   and it would seem to me that if   if   and this was certainly the legislative history behind section 221, not   not behind McCarran. But if   if the same duty is owed by the promisor to the third party that it owes to the promisee, and if the third party has the same rights of enforcement as it does under 304 of the Restatement that the promisee would have, why should it be any different? Why would Congress have intended to exclude that? And it used the word contract.\n Because   because we have a rule that says when Congress wants the United States to be sued, it   it must say so clearly.\n You also have the rule that the word contract means the law of contract and not parts of it.\n But yes, isn't it arguable, though, that in this case the Government probably thought that it would be efficient to have the district represent all the farmers for whatever their   to the extent their interests were shared with one another, rather than having every individual have the same right to bring   bring a lawsuit?\n Efficient in   in collecting land assessments and water charges, but there's no evidence in the   either the language of the statute, I submit, or the  \n Except for the fact that the district is the party to the contract, though.\n Nothing was said about litigation, let alone intended third party beneficiary  \n Well, but the   the whole point of the district   correct if I'm wrong. This is your area. The whole point of the district was to make it easier for the United States to know with whom it was dealing to have an efficient system, and if you say, well, that doesn't include lawsuits for damages, it seems to me that destroys much of the purpose of the formation of the district.\n There's a lot of legislative history there, and it talks a great deal, as you say, Your Honor, about efficiency and   and the convenience. But it's not talking at all about litigation, about remedies, about rights once there's a breach.\n But you haven't really achieved very much efficiency if you simply get the United States out of the business of collecting the payments and of keeping track of the payments but leave the United States subject to suit when the person who has authority to do   do these things goofs. I mean, what   what trouble has the United States saved itself? It would still have to ride herd over   over the person with   with whom it's dealing.\n Well, it   this is a transaction between a water seller and many water buyers. Yes, in 1926 districts were put in the middle, but it's also true in 1939 in   in the section 9(e), Congress authorized the particular type of contracts we have here, so-called water service contracts, and it doesn't mention district. And as a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit has held that the bureau had the discretion administratively to deal with individuals. So throughout the history of the reclamation program, you   you have the   the core transaction is   is a water sale from the Government to   to farmers. And that's was the case on day one in 1902 and it still is. And I'd just like to remind the Court that paragraph 3 of the stipulated judgment at page 110 of the joint appendix is in our view dispositive here. This was a   an agreement by the United States and the district, approved by a court after formal settlement notice was dispatched to two formal classes, and it says, any appropriate relief may be obtained against the Federal parties by the filing of a new action for violation of any contract arising independently of this judgment.\n But the   the Justice Department has no authority to   to consent to suit which   which Congress has not consented to. I don't see how this strengthens your case.\n Again, if   if this Court should hold that neither of the two statutes on   on which we stand waive sovereign immunity, and  \n And this alone wouldn't   wouldn't remedy the  \n Then   then  \n   the absence  \n   the decision that we're not intended beneficiaries should be vacated and we should have a chance to go to the court   Claims Court. I'd like to reserve, Your Honor, 3 minutes, if I may.\n You may, indeed, Mr. Smiland. Mr. Minear, I think you're up next.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Petitioners cannot maintain this suit for breach of the Westlands contract because the Westlands contract is itself subject to the rules of sovereign immunity. And section 390uu authorizes only a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. It does not authorize suits by incidental beneficiaries for money damages. For many of the points that have already been raised by Justice Breyer, Justice Kennedy  \n Mr. Minear, do you think it does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the district?\n In one circumstance, Your Honor. This suit allows a district that has been sued by individual water users to join the United States in the ongoing suit and, in fact, remove the case to Federal court if necessary, so there can be a determination of all the rights in those  \n Did this suit begin as a suit by a water user against the district and then you were joined later? Is that  \n No, it did not, but that did occur in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation that ran between 1978 and 1980.\n Well, in this suit, did not the district bring it against the United States?\n That's correct.\n And was that a   was that jurisdiction proper at that time?\n That suit was brought under the APA, and the district brought the suit on that basis.\n But was it properly brought is what I'm asking you.\n That suit was properly brought.\n Okay.\n But it was not brought under 390uu. Instead, there was an allegation that the United States had acted unlawfully and the Westlands relied on the Administrative Procedure Act.\n And no money damages.\n And no money damages as well, and that's what distinguishes this case.\n So that   so your view   I mean, what   what makes sense to me is that the section means what it says, that consent is given to join the United States. That means join them in an ongoing suit. And it makes sense because what the United States wants is anyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court of Claims. But of course, where you have an ongoing suit between two other people, we'll make an exception because there it's already in another district and we'll let you bring the United States in as a necessary party. The other exception is when you don't sue for money damages. That's in section 702 of the APA. Now, that to me makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with the language. Is that your view or do you have a different view?\n Yes, that is our view, and let me supplement your comments in this regard. Section  \n May I   may I   has that always been your view throughout? (Laughter.)\n It has been our view under 390uu when section 390uu has been   has been raised.\n But throughout the litigation?\n Throughout this litigation? I can't   I can't be sure that we've maintained a consistent position, but ultimately this is a question of sovereign immunity. So the importance is that we get the issue right here.\n There has to be an ongoing suit. You think this section does   does not permit somebody to initiate suit against one party and at the same time against the United States as a necessary party.\n Your Honor, let me explain why that's the case, and there was an answer  \n Why what is the case?\n Why there's a necessity for an ongoing suit.\n You   that is to say, there's a suit between only two individuals and then the United States is brought in.\n Your Honor, this   this provision was enacted in response to a specific problem that's illustrated by the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation. Individual farmers sued an irrigation district. The irrigation district was concerned that it might be subject to inconsistent liability to the farmers on the one hand and the Federal Government on the other, and it sought to join the United States. There was no mechanism in 1978 for that type of suit. Congress acted  \n I understand that. That's one situation that this provision could cover, but there are other situations that this provision could   could cover. Let's say a farmer wants to bring suit against the district, but it doesn't really know whether the fault is with the district or whether the district was   was compelled to do what it did by the United States. So it sues the district and just in case the United States was   was responsible, it joins the United States. Why doesn't the language entirely permit that kind of a suit?\n The language could be construed to allow that, but   but waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly, and the language I think is more properly construed, as Justice Breyer has suggested, to allow joinder as a necessary party. And in fact, it was enacted in specific reaction to that problem in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation where we did have ongoing litigation and there was a sense by the irrigation district they needed to join the United States so they would not be subject to inconsistent suits. So although I think that the language can bear the   the interpretation that you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, nevertheless, I think the better interpretation is the more narrow one that is  \n Then   then how do you explain the last   the last sentence of that provision, which is any suit pursuant to this section? The only suit that the section refers to is a suit in which the United States is joined as a necessary party defendant. That's the subject of the section.\n Yes, and  \n And   and the last sentence says, any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court. And I read that to mean if you want to sue the United States as a necessary party initiating a suit, you can bring it in   in any district court in which the land involved is.\n Your Honor, we read that as allowing removal in those circumstances when the United States is joined later. In any event, I have to say that with regard to   to this disagreement, it does   it's not dispositive or even affect the case here. The fact is that this waiver of sovereign immunity under no circumstances would allow this suit to go forward. Apart from the money damages aspect, which itself is   is   would preclude this type of suit, these parties are not intended beneficiaries, and without being intended beneficiaries, there's   in no circumstances could they ever evoke these provisions.\n Mr. Minear, when you say   when you say not money damages, do you read the words that I read to Mr. Smiland restrictively or do you think they accommodate money damages, that is, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity?\n We think that under your cases, such as Pena v. Lane, there needs to be a specific reference to money damages. This simply is referencing declaratory relief, and so we do not believe it would allow an award of money damages. Rather, the party must go to the Claims Court if they're seeking money damages. And in fact, the waiver of sovereign immunity there is somewhat broader. It does, as mentioned before, allow implied or express contracts. So this suit is simply in the wrong court. But I would like to  \n So money damages   waiver always used the word money damages. When it says adjudicate the rights under the contract, that doesn't include money damages?\n No, I do not think in this context it would. I think there needs to be something more specific. We're really talking about declaring rights here and not providing a specific remedy. And this Court has always taken the view that the Claims Court jurisdiction is the appropriate forum for deciding money damages.\n What about the second sentence?The United States, when a party, shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty and shall be subject to judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction and may obtain review thereof in the same manner and to the same extent? It's subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances. Why isn't that enough to   to say that the court can   can award damages?\n Your Honor, I think that simply refers back to the previous sentence, which refers to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree. Now, if you interpret that to include money damages, then the second sentence would follow, but I   I think the two have to be construed together. And in our view simply allowing a party to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree in these circumstances would not allow award of money damages. Certainly I think Congress would be much clearer.\n Yes, but if contractual rights include a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you get a money judgment in a case like that? That first sentence certainly covers the possibility of a contractual right to be paid something.\n Your Honor, again, waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly. Now, let's  \n That's pretty clear language.\n   I have to say that the language   you're saying that the language   yes, could it conceivably be   be interpreted in   on   that broadly. But that's not  \n Certainly if it were not a   a United States and were a private individual, it would include money damages.\n That might well be, but this is  \n And   and the next sentence, as Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall be treated just like a private party.\n Yes. But Your Honor, ultimately I think that we have to focus on that this is a waiver of sovereign immunity. And   and so far we have not touched on the question of whether these parties  \n Well, I think you've got a very strong argument when you talk about an incidental third party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but now you're asking for a much broader holding than really necessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me.\n Your Honor, I think I started with that point, that an incidental beneficiary cannot invoke this   this provision. And I'd like to   to continue with that point because the party here is merely an incidental beneficiary and not an intended beneficiary. Under any of the   the tests that have been applied for third party beneficiaries, the party here would not qualify as an intended beneficiary. Most importantly, the contracting parties here, the United States and Westlands, expressed no intent to give this party enforcement rights. What's more, the contract does not provide that performance would be rendered to   to the petitioners in this case. The contract is quite clear that performance is rendered to Westlands. This is a contract in which the United States furnishes a specified amount of water to Westlands and Westlands pays money for it. Westlands then has a separate obligation with regard to the farmers.\n Separate from   where does that   that obligation come from?\n That arises from the regulations that the Westlands Water District has enacted that provides for the delivery of water from Westlands to the individual farmers. The United States' obligation  \n That's a State   a State created obligation?\n That's right. That is   and Westlands has the   has the option of either engaging in contracts with the individual farmers or distributing the water through regulation, and it has opted for regulations. Now, Westlands itself is a governmental unit. It is comprised of the   of the very farmers here, among others, who have brought this suit. And it has the authority to act in a representative capacity on behalf of all its members. And that is why the United States enters into contracts with irrigation districts precisely because it allows them to reach accord and agreement and to resolve their disputes. Now, the fact is that the United States and Westlands agree on a great many things. Sometimes they disagree, but when we disagree, we're able to   to speak to one another as two governments representing constituencies and hammer out our differences. And that would be impossible if these types of third party beneficiary suits were allowed. And I think that goes to the crux of what the United States' real concern here is. When there are contracts between one government and another, just as in the context of treaties or compacts among the States, it's vital that the two governmental units be able to deal with one another as governments and to be assured that if they can reach accord on behalf of their representatives   on behalf of the parties they represent, that that will resolve the issue. If it were otherwise, this type of distribution of water  \n Well, you don't take the position, do you, that Westlands could have agreed with the United States that it wouldn't enforce its new laws that deprived the farmers of water? You don't take that position.\n But let's look at what would happen, Your Honor, if that did happen. The individual farmers would sue Westlands, claiming that Westlands was not living up to its contract obligations. Westlands would invoke 390uu and join the United States in that suit. And the question of the legal rights would be determined on that basis. So the mechanism that   that we've specified and the way that we interpret it deals precisely with the problem that you've   you've addressed.\n Yes, but you can't   the   presumably the Federal Government can't negotiate away the Endangered Species Act or something. The fact is that new laws were passed after these contracts were entered into with Westlands. Isn't that right?\n That's correct. And again, I think it's instructive to see what happened in this case. When those laws were enacted, the United States reacted to those. Westlands brought a suit under the APA challenging the interpretation of the statutes. Westlands was entitled to do that under the APA. The United States and Westlands reached an accord, together with the environmental intervenors in this group, that was satisfactory to those parties. And it simply would be very disruptive of the system if a minority of farmers in the Westlands District could then bring a suit and upset that agreement and that accord that had been reached. Finally, I'd like to make a brief  \n Can the district get damages from the Government?\n Technically yes, but their damages are limited by the terms of the contract. Westlands could sue the United States in Claims Court for a breach of the contract, but the contract itself says that any damages that are   that the sole liability of the United States in these circumstances would be an adjustment of the account. In other words, there are not consequential damages. Rather, if we do not provide Westlands with the water that Westlands believes it's entitled to, then we stand liable for an adjustment in the payments that Westlands would make to us. The suit that is being brought here is asking for consequential damages, and we believe that the contract here does not allow consequential damages. That, of course, is a merits question that there's no need for the Court to reach, but that is the way it would be resolved in Claims Court in   in our view. I'd like to also raise the question of property rights since that has   has come up, that one of the arguments that has been made by Westlands is that they're entitled to status of a third party beneficiary because they claim they have water rights in these circumstances. The fact is that the United States, the State of California, and Westlands, as well as the California Water Resources Board and the first tier of California courts, have all concluded they do not have the   the water rights that they claim. But in any event, our view is that that issue is irrelevant to the inquiry here. Rather, the question of third party beneficiary status turns on the intent of the contracting parties. Did they or did they not intend to give enforceable rights to the third party? Here there's not a shred of evidence that that was an intent   there was an intent to create enforceable rights in that third party. Quite to the contrary. The only reference of third parties, the farmers, in the contract here is directed to limitations on what the district can do once it receives its water. It doesn't create rights in them   the individual farmers. Quite to the contrary. What it does it restricts the ability of the district in order to protect the United States' interests, to make sure the United States will be paid for the water that it ultimately provides to the district. The central point that I would like to leave you with, though, here at the end is the importance of protecting the relationship between the United States and Westlands. But although we disagree on some matters, we are able to reach accommodation and agreement, and when we're able to do that, it's to the good of all concerned. The contracts and the laws here are structured to allow those types of agreements to be reached, and we think that allowing third party beneficiary suits would be very disruptive of that   that operation.\n Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Somach, will you tell us what the district's views on this whole matter are?\n Yes, Your Honor. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Westlands Water District has argued in its brief that petitioners are not intended third party beneficiaries with enforceable rights under the 1963 contract. I want to make two points from the perspective of the district why this must be so. First, allowing a direct right of action by petitioners is not practical or consistent with the district's need and ability to function as a governmental entity and to allocate all of the water that it receives under contract to all of the landowners within the   the district. This is a scarce and valuable resource, and these types of third party lawsuits jeopardize the district's ability to be able to provide water pursuant to California Water Code provisions to all of the landowners within the district. Second, the laws of the State of California and reclamation law, working in harmony one with the other  \n Excuse me. Could you expand on the first point a little bit? I mean, you say you don't want to be bothered with lawsuits. Is   is that   is that all that it amounts to?\n No. I   I think quite on the contrary. You know, and unfortunately, the   the history of this contract and these   these issues has been anything other than the district avoiding litigation. The   the whole concept of a water district is not to individualize or incrementalize the water and interests in water in any one group of landowners or any one landowner. The idea is that the rights of all of the landowners to all of the water under the contract are to be treated as a whole and allow the district to provide protection to all of the landowners within the district as a whole, the point there being that the water doesn't belong to any one landowner or a group of landowners. It belongs to the whole. And in fact, the way the district operates, the way it has to operate is in the context of the whole. Bonds are issued. Encumbrances on lands are   are incurred, all based upon not individual rights to water but rather broad rights of water throughout the district. To allow a small group of landowners to decide how to administer the contract, how to enforce the contract in any one given situation leaves decisions that are critical to all of the landowners solely in the hands of an unaccountable small group of   of landowners.\n Can't   can't such a suit be brought in State court? I can't believe that this district can do whatever it wants with the water.\n Oh, absolutely not. Yes, it   yes, it can.\n Really?\n No. What I meant to say was yes, you are right.\n Okay.\n And absolutely not. It can't do just anything it wants to do. It is subject, as a governmental entity, to all the strict requirements of California water law and governmental law, for that matter. If, for example, these petitioners decide for whatever reason they don't like a decision of the   of the board   and in fact, that is an example that exists emanating out of the facts of this case. When the district decided that it was better to settle the litigation, these landowners first petitioned the   the governing of the   of the district and sought to   to have them not proceed in that manner, the way any other group of citizens or constituents with any other governmental entity would have proceeded. The district decided, however, that it was in the best interests of all of the landowners within the district to settle the litigation. Now, at that point in time certainly, these petitioners had the normal and ordinary rights that any   any constituent within the district has to be able to challenge a decision that has been made by the district. That includes, for example, writ proceedings, to argue that the decision of the board was arbitrary, capricious, otherwise unlawful, and that it should   should be mandated to   to proceed in some other fashion. If the issue were damages, this district is subject, like any other governmental entity within the State of California, to the government Tort Claims Act if   if they're tortious type damages. And if we have arguable impairment of property rights, this district is subject to the California constitution, the United States Constitution, and the government code provisions that provide for litigation with respect to those broader types of   of damages. And quite frankly, this is a governmental body and it is very susceptible to the political process. It is not an easy thing for   for the district to be standing up here and telling you that its landowners aren't entitled to receive what they want. That's a very difficult for the district to   to do. But in dealing with the rights of the entire district, it's an absolute essential thing to do. If these landowners had exercised their prerogatives under California law, they could have, assuming they were the majority, controlled the decisions of the board of directors in the way that any majority constituency controls the director   the   the direction and the decisions of a   of a governing board. You know, this   this lawsuit is instructive in   in a number of ways in terms of these practical concerns that we have in terms of how in the world are we going to be able to administer a contract like this one. How are we going to do all of the things that the Water Code has told us that we have to do if, at any given time, a landowner, a small group of landowners is able to go into Federal district court and independently decide that it wants to administer the contract that the district has with the United States or to enforce terms of the contract that it has with the United States in a manner that's inconsistent or different than the way  \n I don't really understand why that's any greater burden than the fact they can sue you in State court anyway. They   they can always bring litigation.\n Well, it   it really requires the district to, in a sense, race to the courthouse with the   with the petitioners in order to be there first in order to have its views of the contract  \n Well, the suit in State court, I assume, would   would only be   the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail.\n Yes.\n Whereas, this suit here   it doesn't matter how reasonable it is. If it's wrong, it's wrong. I mean, it's quite a different  \n No. I think it is a different situation, and I agree with what you   what you have said, Your Honor. I do, however, want to   to not avoid the concern that may be expressed here, and   and that is, that   that what it does is it   it forces the district into a situation of chasing its landowners, in essence, around from one litigation forum to another in order to ensure that its means of controlling and   and administering the contract is not jeopardized. The fact that the landowners   if the landowners can move forward independently with litigation with respect to the contract, what it really does is create in a sense a   the contract becomes this very interesting moving target where the district has its views about what the contract is and how it should be administered, how it should be enforced, and then it proceeds in one direction as, for example, it did with the settlement in this litigation, deciding that that was the best way to protect the interests of the district. Had these petitioners on the merits in a hypothetical situation prevailed with a totally different result, that would have substantially affected and impacted the district's ability to be able to maintain the obligations and the commitments that it made to the other settling parties. That destabilizes the ability of the district to actually act in other governmental forums, in forums with the United States, with the State of California, with other districts in the context of attempting to say we control the contract, we enforce its terms, and we can make commitments. And when we make those commitments, we can abide by and we can live up to those commitments in a way that   that governments ought to be able to do when they're   when they're making those types of commitments. Having the landowners being able to come or   and here, I want to make certain. When I use the word landowners, I'm not saying that the landowners are not beneficiaries of the contract. They certainly are.\n What about the provision in the judgment at page 110 that was   that was cited to us, that   that the parties may obtain other appropriate relief by the filing of a new action?\n Yes. I   I think that that   that phrase is actually begun as a proviso, and I view it as not limiting the ability of the area I landowners in the Barcellos & Wolfsen judgment that you're   that you're quoting from from being able to act in any other way. It was a non-limiting provision. The   the first part of the   the part that you read deals with what their rights to enforce were. The second part was a proviso that simply said notwithstanding this, whatever else you're able to do, you may do. Thank you for your time.\n Thank you, Mr. Somach. Mr. Smiland, you have 9 minutes remaining, but you do not have to use it all.\n Thank you, Your Honor. What happened here is that the United States sold half the water it was obligated to sell under the contract. It doubled the price it was permitted to charge on the other half. It was a massive harm to the farmers. I'm sure you understand.\n Well, you say under the contract. I thought there was a provision in the contract that said that the United States will not be responsible for under-deliveries, and I think it listed the drought and the last thing was any other cause.\n Well, that's what we were about to go to trial on, Your Honor. That's a merits issue. The Ninth Circuit has abstained on whether there was a mandatory statutory duty to cut off this water, and I urge the Court not to   to dive into that pool. We're trying to get in the courthouse doors.\n But you were saying there's   there's a right under this contract to recover from the United States for an under-delivery.\n We have massive cross summary judgment motions on that issue and we were entitled to go to trial on that   on our claim of liability.\n What  \n If  \n No, please.\n No. I've asked a lot of questions. Go on.\n What do you make   excuse me. What do you make of the argument for reasonable construction of the contract that in fact you just simply cannot have a system that would promise the chaos that   that you are promising?\n I   I don't make much of it. The parties here and   and the parties in the West fully understood for 20 years, after Allen Orchards, that the farmers were intended third party beneficiaries. That's   we settled in 1986 with that understanding, and this parade of horribles just has not come to pass.\n Is   is it correct, as Justice Scalia suggested earlier, that so far as State litigation is concerned, it would be limited simply to arbitrary, unreasonable behavior?\n That's true. And even more fundamentally, the United States breached the contract. The district didn't do anything wrong. Why would we sue the district when the United States cut off the water and doubled the charge?\n Well, I think it's arbitrary not to   not to   for an agency, of which you're   you're in some sense at least the beneficiary, not to insist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can insist that the   that a corporation enforce its contracts.\n We had a little mini-trial on that in front of the   in front of the district court, and   and I made that argument, Your Honor, and the district court rejected it.\n No, he was wrong. That was   (Laughter.)\n I agree.\n I guess the reason that you would sue the district would be if you didn't have any enforceable promise from the United States that they didn't   wouldn't do it.\n Well, we   we  \n Now, you think you do. That's the issue in the case.\n We had a stipulated judgment.\n And so therefore   therefore, I'm looking for where that promise is. And you started out by citing a page, which wasn't a page of the contract. It was a page of some kind of settlement, and that page said that the district agrees that they entered into the contract with helping the farmers in mind. I'm sure they did. So what. I mean, I might buy a house with the idea of helping of my child. I'm going to give it to him. That doesn't mean he can enforce the contract.\n German Alliance, Your Honor.\n You mean my child can enforce a contract I enter into with another   I buy a house and I say I intend to give it to my daughter.\n If the contract  \n And then she can enforce the contract?\n If the contract says  \n Yes. If the contract says. Now, that's why I was interested that you didn't cite language in the contract.\n Oh, yes, we did, Your Honor.\n You   well, I mean, you started out by referring me to page 110 or 111  \n That's true.\n   which doesn't. Now, what is the language in the contract  \n Articles  \n   that helps you the most?\n   15 and 29(b) of the '63 contract and also the 1965 contract explicitly refers to benefit, and probably most dramatically, the recordable contracts that were signed actually with my clients and the United States said that they were made in consideration of the direct and indirect benefits that those farmers would gain from the 1963 contract. Now, paragraph 4.2 in the judgment, which came some years later, reconfirmed that. What was new and different about the judgment is that for the first time it made explicit   we think it was implied earlier, but explicit that there was enforceable rights in the farmers, and we've argued it under your German Alliance test that's not required, but if it was required, we bargained for, we got it. The   the court approved that and the Congress approved that. And I   I   personally I've looked at all of these cases in recent months. It's very rare for an intended beneficiary to have language like that. In any case, as I was saying, my clients have suffered massive losses. They've been litigating these claims for 25 years. Everyone has assumed there was waiver of sovereign landowner. Everyone assumed they're intended beneficiaries. And we think we should have a forum and a remedy and a right to our day in court.\n Thank you, Mr. Smiland. The case is taken under advisement.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. May it please the Court: This case concerns whether Congress, in enacting section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act, intended to expose local governments and State and local officials to expansive section 1983 liability with the tens of thousands of wireless antenna zoning decisions they must make each year. Entitled preservation of local zoning authority, section 332 provides for State and local agencies in the first instance to implement specific Federal substantive and procedural requirements, together with preserved State zoning laws, in passing on applications to build or modify wireless towers. It then provides a highly distinctive, independent cause of action for accelerated judicial review of the decisions, including a short limitations period and mandatory expedition. That tailored process is sufficiently comprehensive to evidence Congress' intent for enforcement to occur  \n Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of action, is it? I mean, it's   it's more spare.\n It   it is unusual in its unique focus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for the focus on private enforcement. In other provisions of the Communications Act, the Congress chose   for example, section 253, Congress chose to eliminate enforcement at   at the FCC level because it was concerned that State and local governments often wouldn't have enough   excuse me   local governments in particular  \n Well, what   what  \n   wouldn't be able to   I'm sorry.\n What would you think of a case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning was the   was caused by racial discrimination against the applicant? Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you suppose?\n Yes. That would still be available because the   the section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) only provides for a cause of action for violations of the Communications Act. Violations of the Constitution continue to be enforceable directly under section 1983. Section   section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) is comprehensive in the relevant sense in that for every violation of section 332(c)(7), for every person adversely aggrieved, it provides a mechanism for private judicial enforcement. In addition  \n Well, what about   it   it   section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate relief. What does that include? Could it include punitive damages? Could it include attorney's fees, do you think?\n In that respect, it is indistinguishable   for example, the statute that was at issue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the precise forms of relief available. In our view in this case, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the type of relief that is traditionally given on review of zoning decisions and on review of judicial review of agency action. That's supported by a number of considerations. I should point out, in the first instance, that in this case respondent never did seek damages, or punitive damages for that matter, under section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself. But that's supported by a number of considerations. First is the structure of the act, which presents it as a form of judicial review of agency action. The act is structured much as you have   much as you would when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal requirements and are subject to judicial review. The only difference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State and local agencies with the initial implementers in place of the Federal Government. In that respect, it shares some of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act which are also implemented by local   by   excuse me   by State governments as opposed to the FCC.\n Mr.   Mr. Lamken, the argument has been made that 4 years before the telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted, Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act. And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to declaratory and injunctive relief. Here we face silence. Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in the   in the measure?\n Justice Ginsburg, that   that's an example where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that could be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose to restrict the forms of relief available. And it is an example, in the words of Sea Clammers, where Congress has made its intent explicit in the text of the statute. Congress can also by implication limit the forms of   excuse me   limit the mechanism for relief that's available, and that's our position here, that Congress by providing  \n What's the   what's the source of the implication?\n Pardon?\n You say by implication.\n The implication   Congress has provided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly adapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics such as a very short limitations period.\n So   so the   the implication, I   I guess, is that unless it specifically provides for damages, it implicitly does not.\n I'm sorry. In terms of Congress making damages available under 332(c)(7)(B)(v), our view of the damage   mind you damages are only one of the differences we think that exists here, but our view is supported by a number of considerations, in addition to the structure of the statute. For example, appropriate relief is often   is the traditional form of relief available. In this context traditional relief was always specific relief. Congress also included a specific savings clause that extends not merely to Federal statutes, but prohibits the impairment  \n Excuse me. Where   where are you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?\n This   that comes from this Court's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't specifically identify the specific forms of relief available  \n All right. But that's   that's not in the   that's not in the text of this statute, is it?\n No, it isn't. It is an inference the Court draws from silence. When the Court   when Congress provides an express cause of action and does not identify the specific forms of relief available, the Court will infer that Congress intended to provide all appropriate relief. But the term, appropriate relief, is that relief which Congress would have intended, and when the Court is determining that, it takes a look at what the traditional forms of relief are and it will look at things such as the savings clause in 601(c), which expressly says that the statute should not be read, unless it expressly provides, to supersede, impair, or otherwise modify State and local law, as well as Federal law. And in order to put damages into the statute, if it doesn't provide damages expressly, one would have to impair myriad municipal immunity laws that otherwise protect municipalities and State and local officers implementing zoning requirements from liability. Finally, the FCC has  \n And   and 1983 is not subject to that limitation.\n Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive under this Court's decisions, and it is   it would preempt the State laws by its own force. But we believe that that also supports Congress' decision not to provide   or supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to provide section 1983 relief here because the effect of making the Communications Act enforceable under section 1983 would be to expand the categories of claims for which   that   those immunities are unavailable, and it would thereby impair those immunities.\n But are they only immune from damages action or are they immune from suit?\n No. They're generally immunities   immune from damages actions, not from suits.\n So, I mean, that proves too much because they   the statute obviously intends to eliminate that immunity. The immunity from suit is   is clearly  \n Oh, I think   I think you may have misunderstood. The immunity is not from suit. It's an immunity from damages and the impairment would be the immunity from damages. Section 332 is not designed to impair the municipal immunity statutes, and they are not immunities from suit. They are generally from damage liability. The officers are subject to suit because these are subject  \n Well, it allows suit against either municipalities or States, State or local governments. Right?\n Yes.\n And the States have immunity not just from damages but from suit.\n As a constitutional matter, they have an immunity from suit, but  \n Unless they have chosen to waive it, which  \n Right.\n   one must assume in this area they haven't.\n Right.\n So you have to regard this provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of State law in   inasmuch as they apply to   to immunity.\n Well, first of all, I don't think it would be read to   to override the State's constitutional immunity to suit.\n No. That's  \n But it would be read to   it would be read to override immunities to suit that exist under State law because otherwise it couldn't be affected.\n In for a penny, in for a pound.\n Right.\n If they've   if they've waived  \n But I'm not  \n If   if you acknowledge that it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why   why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect their immunity from damages?\n Well, because it would be   it would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it didn't override immunities to suit. But I'm not sure there are provisions that are providing for   I mean, that there are myriad damages immunity laws that provide municipalities absolute immunity from suit. It's fairly common, at least under California and other State law, for municipalities to be subject to suit for review of their   of the actions that they make. And that is the typical fashion that this   this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of providing judicial review of agency action. Another consideration that supports the view that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act provides an entire process for the implementation of the Federal statutes. It establishes Federal substantive requirements that identifies the agencies to implement them. It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA-like guarantees, like the requirement of substantial evidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like the requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of time. It then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted mechanism for judicial review. In that sense, it is very much like the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson. That elaborate process is particularly significant given the pattern of the Communications Act as a whole. The Communications Act repeatedly matches specific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the common carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with corresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as an action for suit   I mean, an action for damages in court or an enforcement action in the commission in sections 206 and 207.\n Does this action have to be brought in Federal court? It says any court of competent jurisdiction. Could  \n Yes. The action can be brought in State court and often is. There are about 50 reported decisions that we have found where the suit has been brought in State court. I haven't seen a particular pattern between the choice, but Congress gave the option.\n Would a State court be free to award damages or would that be preempted under the view you take of the statute?\n The State   because there's an express preservation of State law in this context, I think that State   States would be free to award damages under their own laws. They wouldn't   whatever relief is available under the Federal statute would be available under the available under the Federal statute, and State courts wouldn't be free to second-guess Congress' judgment as to what relief should be provided under Federal statute.\n If the State court allowed damages   if   if the State system allowed   State law allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action under this section, be allowed to award damages under that   under the State statute?\n Your Honor, I think since the   the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute should not be construed to impair State law   and there are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only have one construction of the statute   I believe that the construction would be an across-the-boards construction, that this act does not provide damages and you would not vary from State to State.\n What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees? Would they be recoverable?\n Pardon?\n What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?\n Well  \n What would you do then?\n If the State law provides for recovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then that would control for State violations. For violations of Federal law, the   the remedies that Congress chose to provide would control and the States would not be permitted to second-guess the   the remedies  \n I'm not sure why that would be if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an APA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which helps your position. Then if the minimum elements of form are not specifically stated in the statute, there's no reason to interfere with the States. Let them do what they want. Only those minimum elements are what you can't do. That works perfectly for you.\n Justice Breyer  \n It's strongly supported in the history. It may lose your client the money. I don't know.\n Well, in fact, California provides a municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my client  \n So then you're only  \n   would be fine with your position. But that is a potential inference. My   the normal view would be that where Congress provides a   a statute, one would normally presume that Congress intended a particular set of remedies to accompany it. You could say that the silence is meant to   meant to reflect the fact that Congress knew that these would be enforced in State courts, as well as Federal, and it would allow State courts  \n Congress didn't care.\n   to use whatever  \n Congress wanted to substitute a Federal judgment for the judgment of the States where it said so. And the reason you know that is because that is what is consistent with the purpose of the act and other things are either neutral or negative. Don't interfere with the State unless you have to.\n That is one of our principal contentions, Justice Breyer, which is  \n And what, Mr. Lamken, would be the normal procedure in the State? You make an application for a permit to a zoning board. What is the standard operating procedure under State law? Suppose we don't have any telecommunications act in the picture.\n The normal procedure is either under a uniform State law or California law. If you have a   an entity which is   excuse me. If you have either a planning commission or sometimes there's another entity that does the initial review and makes a determination whether to grant the permit. It is then appealable either to a zoning board of adjustment   that's the   the model act   or in California, States   localities have the option of having the appeal go to the local legislature. That appeal is then reviewed   is then determined. And finally, once you've gone through that process, under California law it's generally reviewable by a writ of mandate, although other   other States provide review by writ of certiorari, by mandamus, or by various other procedures, almost always subject to a short limitations period, almost always short   requiring finality, a final decision, exhaustion through the State process.\n And the remedies being injunctive and declaratory.\n A   a form of specific relief. Generally they have the authority to effectively go in and revise the decision below, but the remedies ordinarily do not include monetary or compensatory relief I should say.\n Are you saying that it's parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would be?\n It's very much like that. The remand rule that this Court normally requires in the APA context is not so strictly observed in the context of   of review of   judicial review of zoning decisions, but it is very much like APA review. That is what prevails.\n It   it seems to me that the 30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why. (Laughter.)\n Well, actually this Court's decision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and that is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-the-record review of decisions below, are often insufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new record such as their proof of damages, to make important decisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury trial, or to prepare for discovery. And that's why 30-day provisions are not entirely uncommon in the area of judicial review of agency action, but they're wholly unprecedented, for the most part that I know of, in the area of tort-like remedies like section 1983. If I   if there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\n Yes, you may. Mr. Feldman.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Where Congress creates a special cause of action for   for a violation of a Federal law that necessarily carries with it its own features and incidents, Congress' decisions about the appropriate mechanisms for dealing with that violation of Federal law should not be frustrated or overridden by allowing a 1983 action in addition. In this case, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which creates a cause of action for violation of the specific standards in (i) through (iv) is an independent, standalone cause of action. If 1983 didn't exist, 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would, undoubtedly, still provide plaintiffs with a mechanism to get into court and attain redress for the legal wrongs that they claim. Where Congress has taken that step and has thought about what the appropriate remedy should be for a violation of a particular Federal statute and has created a judicial remedy, then it would only frustrate  \n But it   the statute, though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's fees, isn't it?\n It is. It doesn't say anything expressly about either of those things, but I think it has long been  \n Can we infer all appropriate relief? Do we?\n As a matter of damages, I think all appropriate relief would be the standard. But as a matter of attorney's fees, I think is a good example of why there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law is 100 percent clear, from this Court's decision in Alyeska and other cases, that where Congress hasn't provided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting authorized. That's what they intended.\n Attorney's fees are never appropriate, in other words.\n Are never appropriate unless Congress specifically provides for them.\n But it has provided for them for a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes care of it.\n That's right.\n And this is kind of circular.\n I don't think it's circular because I think when Congress created the specific cause of action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be provided. If respondent's view in this case were accepted, the   the presumption would be exactly flipped, and Congress would have had  \n Mr. Feldman  \n Suppose Congress said specifically 1983 applies. That's all it says. Would that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?\n Yes, I   yes, I think it   I think it would. The question here, though, is where Congress has thought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation of a Federal statute and created a judicial cause of action for every wrong that's   that   that can exist under that statute, then the incidents and features of that cause of action should govern, not the incidents and features of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case are different. And attorney's fees is just the best example of that. If   under respondent's view   when Congress was fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of this Court's decisions that have repeatedly said that attorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly provided for. And indeed, elsewhere in the Communications Act  \n Well, I take   you   you take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. It's not just attorney's fees. It's damages.\n That's right. But it's just an illustration. There's other differences between the provision here and 1983, but I think the basic point is that where Congress has given thought to the remedy for a particular violation   type of violation of Federal law and has provided for a judicial cause of action, with whatever features and incidents it   it wants, 1983 shouldn't be allowed in. It should be assumed that Congress didn't want to have its decisions frustrated by also allowing a 1983 action.\n What about damages?\n Do you   do you think that any other provisions of the Communications Act are enforceable under 1983? I mean, we're talking about 332, but it's a big, complicated act. Are any of the other provisions enforceable?\n I think   I think the same rule would apply to any of the provisions where Congress has specifically provided for a cause of action for the same reason, otherwise Congress when   here, for example, just to return to attorney's fees for a second. When Congress was framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't giving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would be construed not to give attorney's fees, but not  \n Well, this is really a more general proposition you're urging upon us then, that whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is   what   in any respect more limited than section 1983, the background action of section 1983 is not available.\n That   I   I think that's correct.\n No. How could that be? Wouldn't it depend on whether   when you look at the particular statute, the particular set of remedies that Congress has included in that statute could be absolutely independent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in favor or leaning against. It would depend on the particular statute. Why in general?\n I think in   I think the rule would be in general because, first of all, it's not just remedies. There's other incidents of a cause of action such as statute of limitations, the provision here for expedition, and other things. And really when Congress has given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation here of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the Communications Act of other Federal standards, it shouldn't be assumed that they all   that   to allow a 1983 action would just frustrate Congress' intent in fashioning that particular remedy.\n Then how would you ever have a statute that   1983 provides for relief when there's a violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional. One of the briefs in this very case says that your broad reading means that you were doing away with statute as a basis for 1983.\n I   I think that that's completely wrong. When Congress has created   has recognized a right, as this Court has found is essential for a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about providing a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause of action in court in particular, then that's the function of 1983, is to serve   it provides a cause of action for people who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory violation. But where Congress has given thought to what kind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of action with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's fees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever the other ones are here, then it would just frustrate Congress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983 action to undo all of the things that Congress provided for.\n Well, there   there are two situations. I mean, one can supplement without frustrating. I mean, you   you could say that in, you know   in some respects the 1983 will contradict the action that was provided, but one can conceive of a provided action that   that grants relief which 1983 would not grant.\n That's right. And   and I   whatever   I guess the general point would be whatever remedial decisions Congress made, those should be respected, but I would add in this case it's not just   it's a question of attorney's fees, which they would have had to   Congress would have had to do something very unusual here, which is particularly put in this statute no   there shall be no fee-shifting because otherwise you can always go to 1983 and get it. In fact, even if they had done that in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), respondents would still argue, well, we still have our 1983 action.\n What   what about damages? Do   do you take any position on whether the Communications Act provision enables damages to be collected?\n We don't have a position on whether it does. I think there's arguments both ways. I would point out  \n You think it's unnecessary to decide this case.\n I think it is unnecessary, and in fact, I think it shows a problem with   a reason why our view, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that should be respected   why that should be respected. Under other views, you have to look at the 1983 action and figure out all of its incidents. You have to look at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents in the abstract as here, not where   in connection with a particular claim for damages, and then see whether they're consistent with each other. I think the much better rule would be to say where Congress has created a specific cause of action, that's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that, you get. Whatever you don't get under that, you don't get. But 1983 shouldn't be used to   to frustrate Congress' intent and give you things that that cause of action wouldn't to give you a longer statute of limitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to give you   eliminate the provision for mandatory expedition, to have any differences in damages. Another way to put it would be under the Court's decision in Franklin, this statute gives you any appropriate relief. All that 1983 could do here   it maybe gives you the same thing in which, as far as that goes, it doesn't matter. But all it could do otherwise would be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that Congress didn't want. And instead of construing the two statutes in that way, they should be construed harmoniously and in accord with this Court's decisions which have set forth the line of cases where you have a right to get into court in Wilder   I'm sorry   in   in Sea Clammers and Smith against Robinson and said there we want to take Congress' remedy, however simple or complex it is. It gives you a complete right to get into court and gives you whatever it gives you. And that should govern. And then the other line of cases, which is Wilder where   and   where it says   and the Wright against Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to get to court   get into court. In those cases, that's the function of 1983. The same thing would be true in   in a number of other this Court's cases that have recognized you have a 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't think at all about the remedy because that's the function that 1983 was supposed to serve. If there's no further questions.\n Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Waxman.\n Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In   by its clear text, section 1983 promises redress for the depravation of any Federal right in any, quote, proper proceeding. And that expansive language, this Court has recognized, dictates a heavy presumption that its remedies apply to all violations of Federal rights, a presumption which this Court has said is rebutted only in the, quote, exceptional case in which the statute that creates the right is accompanied by an enforcement scheme that is, quote, incompatible with or inconsistent with 1983's remedies. That's  \n Mr. Waxman.\n   the background principle.\n Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that the   the best argument we've heard about incompatibility is the one   or at least I think the best   is the one that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his argument, and that is, he said there's   there's a 30-day provision in there, which in effect says Congress wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast. And that is incompatible with a damage action because if you get into a damage action, you are going to get into the panoply of   of damages litigation, including depositions, and   and the one thing you can guarantee is that it is not going to be over expeditiously. What is your argument? What is your response to that incompatibility argument?\n Well, I think that the way this Court has interpreted incompatibility before   in the two instances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was decided, the only instances in which this Court has found incompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an end run around limitations in the statute. That is, in the   in Sea Clammers and in Smith v. Robinson, you had statutes that forestalled an individual's access to court via an administrative regime and then expressly limited the judicial remedies that would be available once they got there by requiring, for example, only injunctive relief.\n Well, the other word is inconsistent, and is it   sorry. Were you   is it inconsistent if Congress didn't want it? And if that's insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at the statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it sounds like an administrative law statute. If I saw the maintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty statute.\n Okay. I  \n I see an administrative law statute. It sounds like that's the system they're imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to fail.\n Okay. Now I have two points. I   I don't want to forget these. I have to deal with the   the question of whether a 30-day requirement is inconsistent and whether damages would be inconsistent with what   with what my colleagues posit as an APA-like administrative review model. A 30-day requirement is simply a reflection of Congress'   Congress confirming expressly that somebody who   who is aggrieved under the rights provided to him under 332(c)(7) and wants any judicial remedy, whether it's from 1983 or otherwise, has to go to court promptly. It's precisely what 1983, this Court said in Patsy and Felder, guarantees and requires. It does not require  \n But it also requires expeditiousness on the part of the court.\n It requires that the court proceed expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where damages are sought or are not sought. One of the interesting things about damages  \n But do you   do you agree with this much, that if   if damages, in fact, are going to be allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious if damages are not allowed.\n I don't think that's true. In fact, I think this case is a pretty good example. The court separated it   I mean, acting under a requirement of expedition at the request of the city. This   the court didn't even begin to address this case until 18 months after it had been filed. But what it said was  \n Okay. And   and that  \n   the first issue  \n   that was a violation of the statute, wasn't it?\n Well, it first issued an order saying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've determined that the statute is violated. Now we will have a separate proceeding. Then the city will conduct itself accordingly. Now we'll have a separate proceeding in order to determine whether damages or attorney's fees are available. And that is available in any of these cases. What  \n So they turned the damage issue basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end of the case.\n It could or could not be, and there may   may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate but  \n I thought that was just to decide in   in the   in the court of first instance   that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific case damages or attorney's fees were due. But the district court was deciding a question of law, that is, whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.\n What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was we'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available and to what extent in a separate proceeding. As it turns out, he concluded in an  \n But was not making a rule for this case only. He was making a ruling of law.\n For sure. He said that I don't think you're entitled to this because I think that the statute doesn't allow it. And therefore, he didn't get to this question. But the point about damages   I think there are two points that are very important that not be obscured. First of all, the Government   the fact that the Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether the statute itself provides damages relief under the principle of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County certainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on this subject.\n They   they don't necessarily disagree. The Government just says the   the issue doesn't have to be reached in this case.\n Well, I think   I think that   what the Government says in its papers is they may well be available and what Mr. Feldman   I don't want to misquote him, but he said that under Franklin   he agreed, I think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh Circuit, which is where no remedies   where no specific remedies are specified   and that's the case here   you apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v. Hood and applied to an implied right of action in Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is available. And damages are the paradigm.\n Mr. Waxman.\n And the irony here  \n Mr. Waxman, how do you   how do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is applicable to the cause of action under the Communications Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983? I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983. There's no 30-day limit there.\n I have   I have two different ways to get to that. First of all, section 1983, by its terms, provides redress in any appropriate cause of action. It also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that are brought under 1983.\n No, it doesn't.\n But more broadly  \n It doesn't require you to   to establish a cause of action under some other statute either.\n That's right. It provides a  \n It does not at all. It's   it's self-contained. And do you know any case where we have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from the statute that was violated and which forms the basis for the 1983 action?\n Well, I don't, but I do know that this Court   first of all, Congress has now enacted section 1658 which provides a   a 4-year Federal default statute of limitations, where   where a statute like 1983 doesn't provide it, but includes an   an introduction that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law. And there's certainly nothing in that language that says when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is enforcing. And even before that, when your   your decision in Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to figure out what statute of limitations applies to a freestanding 1983 action, there are   there is a tripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires you to engage in. And the first part is to see whether there is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of limitations. Now, in constitutional cases, like the one that was at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social Security Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v. Thiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much less any express statute of limitations. And so this Court said you then go to the second rule, which is what's the most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires. But the anomaly of the argument here is we have a background principle that 1983 is available and there is a heavy presumption that it will be available unless it is explicitly incompatible or inconsistent with  \n Well, that's  \n   and  \n   that's why I'm approaching it differently, and I   I want to get your view on it. I'm taking the word inconsistent and I'm using that as a guide back into the purpose of the statute. And once I do that, I find Congress here anxious, I think, to engage in what I'd call cooperative federalism. They could have run the whole show, but they said we don't want the FCC. We want each city and town to do what they want, subject to a few minimal procedural requirements. If that's right, that means all these damages questions are open. All kinds of things are open, but   and we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe deferring to the State, but one thing is true: 1983 doesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.\n Justice Breyer, this is not the APA model. This is not a model of administrative review for a number of reasons. Number one, it is a background   there   there   it is established, for purposes of this case, that this statute creates individual Federal rights and those rights were violated. And the background rule is uniformly   and this Court has   has   in Owens v. City of Indianapolis and many other cases has reinforced the principle that damages are available and 1983 is available where Federal rights are violated by municipalities, whether it's under the Takings Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause or in statutory cases. What is more  \n Mr. Waxman   Mr. Waxman, one of these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC, the one having to do with emissions. Now, if you sought review from the local decision to the FCC, you petition for FCC relief, would the FCC have authority to give you attorney's fees?\n The FCC has said that it does not if you do that. In   in 2000, when the FCC last reported, one person had chosen to go that route rather than go to Federal court. It  \n Well, isn't that an incongruity that Congress would say you have your choice? Complainant, you can go to the Federal agency, the FCC, or you can go to court.\n You can't go to the   excuse me. I didn't  \n So if   if you have that choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to go the   why would any litigant ever do that? Why would any attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the FCC and you do get fees in court? Wouldn't the presumption be that it would work the same way whether you go to the agency, Federal agency, or Federal or State court, that you're in the same situation as respect to fees?\n The   the FCC alternative for a declaration by the FCC applies to only one of the five rights that are provided here, and even if it applied to all of them, I don't think you could possibly infer that  \n Well, let's take the one, that   that one. Are you saying no attorney's fees there because you couldn't get them at the FCC, therefore you shouldn't get them in court?\n Absolutely not. If   if there were an instance in which a local zoning official said, you know, I know I'm not supposed to take radio frequencies emissions into account, but I'm going to, it's denied, I would have the right either to go to the FCC and say, tell them no, or to file an action under 332 and/or 1983 and say that violates my rights. And actually your example  \n But isn't  \n If I just may finish. Your example, I think   the example of this particular provision points out that what   the balance of what I was going to explain to Justice Breyer, which is that another reason why this isn't the APA model is that this statute includes in little (i) and little (ii) substantive provisions, not just procedural provisions. You can't discriminate, to give Justice O'Connor's first example, among providers. The   that was a complaint in this case. There is de novo review, it is clear, on those claims. It's not administrative APA review in any respect. And in fact, the district judge in this very case, Judge Wilson, says it looks like, in fact, you were discriminated against, but I don't need to reach that because it's clear that there was no substantial evidence.\n They   they didn't provide for the normal administrative review because they were quite aware that under the State zoning systems, there would always be State administrative review before the issue even comes up.\n And this  \n And so what this provides is what kind of judicial review there will be after the anticipated administrative review before the zoning board and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.\n I   I have to respectfully disagree. This Court, in   in Williamson County and Darby and many other cases, has distinguished carefully between final   final action and exhaustion of administrative review or judicial review. And all this statute requires is that if you are aggrieved by an action or inaction of a State or local government or an instrumentality thereof  \n Final. Final action or failure to act is what  \n That's correct.\n Final action or failure to.\n And final action, this Court has explained, does not import into it exhaustion of either a State administrative or judicial remedies. What it means is that once you have been injured, it's a   it's a ripeness requirement that's familiar under  \n You haven't been injured until you've exhausted your  \n That is  \n You   you really think that when there is a State provision available for review of the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 without even going through the administrative appeals?\n I am entirely certain of that, and in fact, the   the local ordinance   I mean, the question of what is final agency action is surely a Federal question, but  \n This is really respecting the States, which is what the   the purpose of this   of this whole provision was.\n Justice Scalia, when Congress addressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points out in the very first page of its brief and as the legislative history reflects, it was confronting a situation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning authorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the creation of a national wireless network. And it was so concerned about this that the House actually passed a provision that removed this paradigmatic local authority to the FCC. The FCC was  \n Which would be more burdensome? That enactment or subjecting municipalities nationwide to damages? Which would be more intrusive and burdensome on federalism  \n I think  \n   and the abilities of local governments to function?\n Oh, I think the former, for sure. I mean, the notion that zoning decisions, siting decisions would be removed entirely from localities is unbelievably intrusive. And what happened in the conference committee was a compromise was reached whereby Congress' objective was going to be achieved by creating   by leaving it, in the first instance, Justice Kennedy, to local  \n Well, I'm   I'm not so sure because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney's fees.\n Well  \n And I  \n   let me just say this, with respect to the  \n Plus other   plus other damages.\n I think this case, Justice Kennedy   I have three things to say about this. Just this case is every bit as   as paradigmatic as the parade of horribles that they suggest. And here's my proof. It has been since 1997 that courts have been ruling that 1983 and damages are available under this statute. There is no evidence in any of the briefs on the other side or any of their amici that there has either been a flood of litigation or inappropriately large awards. And if that happened, Congress would do   would be attentive to it in the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out when the local cable authorities came to   came to the very same committees 4 years before and said, we're being hit   there's an express right of action in 555 of the   the Communications Act. We're being hit with very large 1983 awards. Please do something about it. And the very same committees 4 years before enacted a provision that said you may get only injunctive and declaratory relief, thereby creating an incompatibility with 1983, as the legislative history expressly provides.\n Well, cable   cable media companies may   may have Congress' ear more readily than   than   you know, than the municipality of whatever this is or any  \n State and   than State and local governments? I hope not. But here's   here's the additional  \n But I   I wouldn't put a lot of money on it. (Laughter.)\n The point is that Congress   Justice Kennedy, the point is not that Congress was being inattentive to State and local budgets. What it wanted to do what was this   the point this Court the addressed in   in Stakura and   and Owens v. City of Indianapolis, which is to enforce a Federal statute through privately enforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages remedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that had provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program and provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate. Now, this Court has made clear, with respect to damages, in   in Carey v. Piphus and other cases, that there may be very many cases in which there's a violation of a procedural right but only nominal damages are available. And in Buckhannon  \n But with respect to  \n If I may just finish this sentence. And in Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, this Court has   has recognized that in order to get attorney's fees, you have to have substantially prevailed and a court, under 1988(b), may award attorney's fees in its   may award   in its discretion insofar as they are reasonable. And  \n Mr.   Mr. Waxman.\n Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\n There is in this legislative record a concern expressed by a Senator from California when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the Federal review forum. And that was rejected, if I understand correctly, because there was a concern that municipalities would have to travel all the way to Washington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum. And Congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the cost of transporting their representative to D.C. Well, that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that would be awarded.\n First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I   the reference to those two Senators   what those two Senators were talking about is not, as my colleague's brief suggests, this provision. They were talking about another provision of the Telecom Act. I think it was section 253, but I may be wrong. But even if that's the case, the fact of the matter is that whether it was going to cost them   I agree. It would cost   look, a regime in   which left all of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking, and it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on local municipalities to have to come to Washington to justify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which would have to send an army out to example   I mean, it would sort of like be the   the television commercial, you know, where the guy is walking around saying, you know, can you hear me now, can you hear me now? The fact is it made great sense to continue to leave the initial decisions with local authorities. But Congress had   was frustrated, expressly frustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which they had let local authorities do it under their normal routines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting the job done. That was the imperative of this statute. And in the   in the absence of any evidence, even now 11 years later   or I guess it's 10 years   9 years later. In the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or inappropriate awards, I think given the very heavy presumption that this Court has recognized over and over and over again, that 1983 is there.\n That isn't the only  \n 1983 is the background principle against which Congress legislates. And this statute either   neither provides nor excludes any remedies, and all it does is confirm that when you go   when you are injured, you can go to court. And  \n The other   the other harm is there any evidence of because it's   it would also be harmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite difficult decisions, because the   the antenna   they bristle up and you put them in the wrong place. They're environmentally harmful. They   there are a lot of bad things, as well as good things about them. And of course, it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning boards were erring too much on the side of granting everybody's application, as well as too much on the side of not granting them.\n To be sure.\n And so I   I don't know how   what the   there won't be evidence. How can we get evidence on such a thing?\n The   the   you   the evidence will be either in the decided cases or by local municipal governments coming to Congress and saying, this is too heavy a thumb on the scale. But what we know is that if you afford only prospective relief, which is the   the ancien regime that Congress was   that Congress felt wasn't doing the job, it provides no deterrent, no incentive to accomplish what Congress said was  \n But I   I don't think we  \n   a compelling national objective.\n I don't think we usually think of   of judicial review of agency decisions in the ordinary course as being a deterrent.\n We  \n It's an opportunity to elaborate reasons. It's a safeguard. It's not a deterrent. And you're saying it has to be a deterrent. And as Justice Breyer indicates, it   it means that there's   there's another voice in that   in that administrative hearing room. They're terrified of damages.\n Justice Kennedy  \n And it's going to skew the decisions.\n Justice Kennedy, it   under their   under the regulations of this municipality, which is   is perfectly representative, it is final agency action when the city planning commissioner says no, unless you choose to appeal it to the city council. And there is   not only is there nothing peculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the violation by a State and local government of an express Federal right, assuming you can prove not only that the right was violated but also that you were really damaged. It's   I'm not suggesting that   that Congress had damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct. You have said in a variety of instances   I mentioned Stacura in particular   that 1983 damages do serve as a deterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal local officials. But what Congress had   Congress had to come up with some way to confront this problem in which there were sort of local parochial  \n May I ask this question, Mr. Waxman? I don't know if it's really a legal question exactly, but I have the impression that most of the plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed, large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff. And therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive to be sure these rights are protected. Is that a correct impression or is it incorrect?\n I   I don't know whether it's a correct impression or not. Our brief points the Court to an authority that at least 9,500 of the entities that have   have created antennas or tower facilities have 10 or fewer facilities. And one thing we know for sure is that when Congress enacted the Telecom Act of 1996, it specifically wanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies. It had specific provisions in the law to give special treatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster diversity and competition. But in the event that you  \n I can't imagine   I can't imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their mistakes, which is what you're saying.\n Well  \n You're saying the municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people to take advantage of, is just washed out. One mistake at the lowest level and you get damages and you get attorney's fees. That   that is extraordinary.\n Justice Scalia, the   the   1983   and your jurisprudence shouts this as clearly as it does any other principle   stands for the proposition that it's there unless, in the explicit language of the statute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated incompatibility. And that's the background rule. There are many instances in the Telecom Act and elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get injunctive relief. You may not get 1983 damages. I mean, go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title II of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly   expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation of 1983. And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged and entrenched intransigence by this particular municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v. the Village of Mequon. But this Court has recognized, as have the lower courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you really have been damaged. And in an instance where there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus, where the damages are purely nominal. The agency is given the opportunity. In this case, the city never said, give us the opportunity to go back and correct it. And Judge Wilson, a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing to go back and correct because the only thing   the only reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna and tower in the first place. It   we concede that it makes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago and have no right to modify. And therefore, there was a substantive violation, not just, you know, you   you may have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back. There's a line of cases this Court has decided under the Social Security Act where there have been remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get damages. And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you probably don't get attorney's fees either. If there ever is the sort of parade of horribles that they protest about, even a small parade of horribles, Congress will be as attentive as it was in 1992 when the cable  \n Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Lamken, you have about 4 minutes left.\n I'd like to make only two brief points. First, that the imposition of the   of damages and fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court for even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the antenna siting rules, which are often complex and uncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and aggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees on municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce their zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly attempted to preserve in the statute itself. It is   in this case alone, for example, respondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees   and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add   is   is $15 million, essentially the city's entire budget for a year. And respondent claims to be a relatively small operator. That sort of   with that sort of liability in an uncertain area of law, very few municipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights to enforce local zoning even when they're relatively certain that they are right. Section 332(c)(7) is entitled and has one of its purposes as the preservation of local authority. It should not be construed to provide for that authority's evisceration. The second point I wanted to hit is that when Congress established the mechanism for review in 332, it provided a very adapted mechanism with an unusual pair of characteristics: a very short limitations period and mandatory expedition. This Court's decisions in Novotny makes it clear that neither of those requirements can be simply transferred over to section 1983. Novotny had very similar language, a 90-day limitations period. The Court did not transfer that over to section 1983. Instead it understood that the general rule, the general Federal principle of law, that in the absence of an express limitations period, that State law would control. Wilson then confirms that rule, as an interpretation of section 1988, that the governing Federal principle is that State law controls unless there's an express Federal cause of   statute that addresses that particular cause of action. If there are no further questions, we ask only that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Lamken. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens and may it please the Court. Before this Court is a setting of law in a courthouse and a display on law that contains the universally recognized symbol of law. Despite the fact that the deck law occupies only one tenth of this otherwise secular display, the Sixth Circuit struck it down. The Court focused solely on the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments and that's aired by ignoring the overall context. The Ten Commandments is unlike most any other acknowledgment. It is in a category essentially all by itself. It is thematic in common places in courthouses while Nativity scenes and menorahs occur occasionally and often gratuitously on public property. The Ten Commandments occurs quite frequently and has for more than a century in courthouses all over this nation. It is associated with courthouses for a clear historic reason, because the Ten Commandments has played an influential role in American law and government and our system of law in this country. The context in this case is clearly important. Yet the Sixth Circuit  \n May I ask you there basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia made in the course of the last argument? The context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in the course of litigation over this and it started out with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version 2, the Ten Commandments had certain   were surrounded by certain quotations of religious content from other texts. And finally, as I guess literally is true with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten to the present context. Isn't the problem that you have to face, as I've said before, what Justice Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going on. Everybody knows that the present context is simply litigation dressing and that the object for what is going on is the object that was revealed in the first place. What is your response to that?\n Several. The display in this case has three different phases. First it was the stand-alone Ten Commandments. They were sued. They could have defended that but they chose instead to switch rather than fight because they wanted to try to comply with this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence, to try to figure out how to be able to display this particular document. They stepped, however, on a land mine admittedly with this second display.\n Well, they created the land mine basically. I mean  \n They were trying to do the best that they could, trying to follow this ever bending establishment clause jurisprudence especially in the area of displays. Remember this was back in 1999. At that time, there were less than a handful of reported decisions ever in this country on the Ten Commandments. The first was in 1973, Stone was in 1980 and there were a couple of others. There are only 30 reported cases in the country or so and 23 of those happened from 1999 to the present so they didn't have really any guidance. They were trying to follow Lynch and Allegheny as best as they could but these are governmental officials. They're not jurists schooled in the law. And admittedly they made a mistake. But what they have now is the foundation is display and as the District Court recognized, it is fundamentally different than any previous display. Like this Court's decision in the Sunday law cases, even though it may have started off for a religious purpose, the Sunday laws were continued to be retained for secular reasons. In this case  \n Are you saying that the purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't matter?\n We're saying that in this case, the purpose is about the display of law. We also have an argument later on that this Court should reconsider the purpose in generally as it relates to the Lemon test.\n Okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true. The current display includes the display of a lot of legal documents. But is there any reason for anyone to believe that that display of legal documents or anything else would be there for any other purpose than the display of the Ten Commandments, including the religious, the overtly theistic part of the text?\n Yes, Your Honor. The District Court actually recognized that one of the omni intended effects of the history is to educate everyone of the difference between an acknowledgment and an establishment. And even if they had a religious purpose under the second display, that religious purpose has been buried and has been abandoned. They voluntarily accepted the  \n You're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?\n No, we're not.\n Okay.\n And that's why we said that they could have defended the individual first display which was the Ten Commandments alone, in part because it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse. They could have defended when they were originally sued on that basis alone but instead they chose to modify the display. And when they modified the display, it had excerpted sections around it.\n But is there   I guess   I don't want to tie you up too long but I mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the Ten Commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the Ten Commandments and the religious text?\n Your Honor, they must be able to change their misstep, if it was a misstep, that they had. Otherwise, that past case would be superimposed on the foundation's display forever and the question would be  \n Well, not forever but for now. This isn't a case in which they came up with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, let's have a display of important documents in the history of law. This in fact is a continuous process and it is a continuous process within the context of litigation about the constitutionality of the display. It's not a   the implication is not that you can never have a different display but that there is no reason to believe that the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed. What is your response to that?\n The intent has certainly broadened in this case and there is clearly no evidence in this record that this foundations display is solely purposed or intended to be a religious display. In fact, even the respondents of amici that wrote against us said that on the face of this display, it appears secular in nature. It does. In fact, the foundations display not only has numerous other documents of which the Ten Commandments is only one tenth of these many other document but it also has a foundations document that says what the purpose is about. There is only two places that talk about the purpose on the foundations display. On the document itself, which says it's a display about some documents that influenced American law and government, and the undisputed testimony that these are documents that reflect documents that have influenced American law and government. That's the record before this Court on the foundations display and that is fundamentally different  \n Suppose we go back to the first display. If all that was there was the Ten Commandments, now, in your opinion, was that constitutional?\n That is arguably constitutional  \n Do we take it along with the resolution of the counties? Do we look at everything?\n Your Honor, there was no resolution, Justice O'Connor, for the first display. It just went up.\n So just that first display, what was the purpose of that first one?\n The purpose of that first one is like it is in many courthouses around the country. Both courthouses have numerous documents of his historical nature along the walls,284 just in the curia alone. And in Pulaski, many, many documents, when they celebrated their 200th anniversary in 1999. So that was one of many documents that's there and that was a document of the Ten Commandments that was meant to show the historic nature of the Ten Commandments, how it has in fact influenced American law and government in the appropriate setting of a courthouse.\n The original one?\n The original one.\n Was there anything there that said we're interested in history and what we're not interested in is having this on the wall as   to encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage them to study religion and to understand that in their lives, religion should be important and this very solemn secular setting. Nonetheless, religion is important. Is there anything like that on the document itself?\n No, it was just the document itself in a frame on a wall amongst almost 300 other documents.\n What if its purpose were to demonstrate   and I quote from one of our earlier opinions   that we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. What if that were its purpose? Would that have made it bad?\n I don't believe so, Justice Scalia, because that in fact is an acknowledgement that is part of our history; like in Marsh versus Chambers. That's why this Court has authorized prayers before legislative sessions or suggested that the national motto is constitutional because indeed we are a religious people as this Court has said more than five times. We are a religious people. Our institutions do presuppose the existence of a Supreme Being.\n And is it your position that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not agree with that message?\n That's correct, Your Honor. Justice Kennedy, it would not inflict any harm because in this case, it's a passive display in a courthouse in a hallway and you could simply walk past that and avert your eyes once you see this. It inflicts no harm, it does not  \n Mr. Staver, what about all the distinctions that have been made between messages that are brief or I think the expression has been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in God we Trust, like God save the United States and this Honorable Court, like under God, and a document that is about worshipping the Lord, at least as many words devoted to that topic. So it's not a brief reference. It's a powerful statement of the covenants that the Lord is making with his people.\n Justice Ginsburg, the Ten Commandments is a unique symbol in the area of acknowledgment because of its historic role in influencing our law and government. It is displayed in this context for that unique role. It does have some statements in there about God but, frankly, very few when you look at the overall context.\n Have you read the first four commandments and could you say that?\n Sure. And those are definitely and decidedly religious. There is no question that the Ten Commandments is a religious document. There is also no question that it has influenced our American law.\n Do you think the Ten Commandments are longer than the legislative prayers you've heard at the beginning of congressional sessions?\n No, Justice Scalia. I think they're quite shorter.\n I don't know how much help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of the involvement of the government, is the government involved in religion when it posts the Ten Commandments alone? Yes, of course it is. Now, there could be a purpose to it, that they want to just show the history of law but it's all by itself and there is a lot more history than that and context may matter a lot. Not everybody will go with the Ten Commandments just by itself there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far. This is going too far. Why? Because it isn't really related to history, it's the only thing up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth. Now, suppose I go down that track because what I'm really looking for is a key as to what's too far and what's not. But for present purposes, let's assume it's too far. Now, once they've gone too far there, the next thing that happens is they keep changing it but they change it pursuant to the resolution and it seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to surround what went too far with a number of other things that would somehow make it legal. Now, if it was wrong to begin with, is it wrong to end with?\n No, Justice Breyer, it is not wrong to end with any more than it would be wrong to begin with the Sunday laws based upon the Sabbath commandment which was a commandment about worship and the end with the secular reason for keeping those particular laws as this Court has recognized in McGowan. And in this case, even if they started off with a decidedly and only religious purpose, which we contend they did not, they did not end with one and they've got to, as governmental officials, be able to adjust their missteps whenever they step on a constitutional land mine that is sometimes blurry and confusing to them. That's what they tried to do in this case, the best efforts to try to follow this Court's decision when there was really no specific guidelines for them to be guiding their direction. The Ten Commandments that Justice Stevens, you had mentioned about the versions, the versions I don't believe, with all due respect, are relevant in this case or any other case regarding the Ten Commandments because if that were the case, you wouldn't be able to teach the Bible in an appropriate context because there are so many different versions and yet Stone and Schempp has indicated that you indeed can teach even the Biblical text with all of its multiple versions.\n But I assume if you were running a course in a school about the biblical text, you would explain the differences. You would indicate the difference between the Jewish, the Roman, the Protestant, the Lutheran and so on and you're not doing that here. I would have thought your answer might be, well, if that really made a difference, we could have separate versions. But it's not comparable to school teaching.\n Justice Souter, it would in fact be somewhat comparable because if you're teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all the versions lined out.\n Would you think it was appropriate in a public school course that was otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments?\n We would believe that, in fact, in this case, I don't even think they thought about whether there were different versions but we certainly believe that they could have the text there and talk about the Ten Commandments.\n In a public school, wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual reasons if not the reasons of the establishment clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with differently in the standard Roman translation and the preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded as commandment number 1 are different in the Christian versus Jewish and so on. Wouldn't that be an intellectually responsible requirement?\n That's in a school context which this is a courthouse context.\n Exactly. I thought you were equating the two together.\n Not one to one but I think the version issue, if there is a version that flunks the test, it would be this Court's south frieze. It's actually in Hebrew and it speaks only to Jewish people. But yet that's not sectarian such that it violates the establishment clause. That's the acknowledgment as opposed to an establishment. Justice Stevens, if you would like, I would like to reserve the remaining of my time.\n Yes, you may do so. Mr. Clement, you're welcome to stand up for a second time.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court. The display of historical documents here, like the display in the Lynch against Donnelly case of the creche, may include a religious item without running afoul of the establishment clause. As in the  \n Do we have to consider the history of the display at all?\n Justice O'Connor, we would urge you not to consider the history of the display. You in your concurring opinion in the Pinette case made the point that in the context of accommodations, the inquiry into religious purpose doesn't make a lot of sense and you urged the Court to drop it in that context. I think so too in the acknowledgment context. Certainly if you have a situation where you don't have   I think in the acknowledgment context as well, a focus on purpose may not be that productive. But I would like to talk about the purpose  \n I don't know what you mean by the acknowledgment context.\n I think this Court has said that you can accommodate religions. They've also said that you can acknowledge the role that religion has played in our society and I think in both contexts, a focus on purpose is probably not a prudent exercise of judicial resources. But I would like to talk about the purpose here because I think what you have here is a display of a document alone in the first instance that certainly was at least defensible and probably constitutional, yet the courts below got off on the wrong foot by saying that the first display was open defiance of this Court's decision in Stone against Graham and I think this Court's cases themselves suggest that the contextual differences between the school and the courtroom are enough to at least make the display not in open defiance. Now there was the second display and we are not here to defend the second display but that was the display that was in reaction to the lawsuit filed against the first display. Now, I don't know if that second display was the product of bad legal advice or simply frustration at the first lawsuit being filed but I don't think it should make a constitutional difference. In the Lynch against Donnelly case, Mayor Lynch, after the ACLU filed a lawsuit against him, had a rally at the site of the creche, a press conference, where he publicly vowed to fight to keep Christ in Christmas and then he led city workers in carols and said they should sing another one that apparently bothers people. Yet despite that adverse reaction to the litigation being filed against the city of Pawtucket, this Court upheld the display and although the dissent did focus on the mayor's crusade to keep Christ in Christmas, the majority and the concurring opinions did not. And I think that is the proper mode of analysis. Now, the second point I think is should these counties be faulted for trying to bring their practices in compliance with the Constitution? And I think the answer there is clearly not. And I was going to point this Court to the Marsh case that's been talked about quite a bit. One of the things that as Professor Chemerinsky said about the Marsh case that this Court emphasized in that case itself and in subsequent cases is the fact that the prayers there were non-sectarian in the sense that they did not directly invoke, say, Christ. But that actually is something of a change that took place after the litigation began. Prior to the litigation, there were explicit references to Christ as Justice Stevens pointed out in footnote 2 of his dissent in that case. But the state of Nebraska, after they had a lawsuit, decided let's make this an easier case for the Court, not a harder case, and they modified their conduct.\n Okay, but at the end of the day in Marsh, there wasn't any question that what they were doing was praying. And here it seems to me that the change that you're arguing for as significant is only significant unless it is a change in the essential activity because there is no law and it would be crazy law from this Court that said you can engage in religious endorsement, promotions, et cetera, so long as you hide the ball well enough. What this Court basically has said is you can engage in secular objectives that incidentally involve religious figures or references, e.g., Moses up there. What you started with in this case or what the county started with was a pretty religious-looking exercise and the question is, did they go from a totally religious exercise to a secular exercise or did they go from an obviously religious exercise to an obscured religious exercise? And therefore, you can't make context a mere change in physical context dispositive because it ignores that distinction. And that distinction I think is what is driving or what is going to drive possibly in my mind the resolution of this case. What do you say to that?\n Justice Souter, I have two points in response. First of all, what I think would be a crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the Court to say that this display is a foundation to the law document, it's perfectly constitutional in every other county courthouse in Kentucky except for McCreary County and Pulaski County because of their prior conduct. The second point that I think is important in this context is that I think this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence is already difficult enough to apply without creating the First Amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\n Basically, and I think I understand you, you're saying, and I think you said it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have a   try to move toward an objective criterion saying there are some ways you can display religious things and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as distinct from an intent jurisprudence. That's your point, isn't it?\n That would be my point, Justice Souter, but I also think independent of that point, it is also not a particular productive jurisprudence to really treat different municipalities differently because the mayor in one case may have started with the creche and decided to add the wishing well or in the other case started the wishing well and added the creche. I don't think it makes any sense that if they end up in the same place, the constitutional rules could be the same.\n Mr. Clement, you placed heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was undisguised and it was permitted to have since the beginning of our nation. Would it be equally compatible with the establishment clause if this Court opened its daily sessions with prayer?\n Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure that I could the jurisprudence that said this Court could not open its sessions with a prayer but the Capitol can. Now, if there was any difference drawn at all, I would assume it would be a difference based on history.\n I'm not sure we don't deal with it. I don't know who we're addressing when we say God save the United States and this Honorable Court.\n The kind of prayer that is used to open the legislative sessions which this Court has distinguished from in God we trust, God save the United States and this Honorable Court.\n And as I said, Justice Ginsburg, I think if there were a difference in principle, it would have to be a difference based on history. But I don't think there is   in this context, I think it is fair to say  \n I'm asking you what your view is of the compatibility of every federal Court in the country having over the bench a replica of the Ten Commandments and opening each session with prayer.\n Justice Ginsburg, I suppose if the federal courts decided to do that, we would probably try to defend them on establishment clause grounds. I don't think, though, that   I think that would obviously be a much tougher case than the posting of the Ten Commandments in the outer hallway along with a variety of other documents which I take it to be the first case here. And then the final display that the Court has before it is actually the Ten Commandments in the context of the other secular historical documents. And I think that kind of display clearly is constitutional for the reasons that the display was constitutional in the Lynch case.\n Do you think we have to amend the Lemon test to reach your approach?\n Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court on a variety of occasions has chosen to simply put Lemon to one side as opposed to overtly amending it.\n Do you think, then, we have to either put it aside or amend it?\n No, I don't, Justice O'Connor.\n To decide this case?\n No, I don't. I think it would be prudent, as I suggested at the outset, to make not necessarily a full amendment and eliminate the first purpose prong of Lemon but at least in the acknowledgment context as in the accommodation context we're not going to focus on that. But independent of that, I think many of these Court's cases that were decided even under Lemon acknowledge the principles that municipalities should be rewarded, not punished, nor trying to change their conduct to try to get things right. In Abbington against Schempp, which I think in many respects is a precursor to Lemon because it talked at least about the purpose and effects test and I gather that's about all that's left of Lemon. In that case, this Court held out the promise that it might be permissible for the government to have some use of the Bible in school. Now, when it did that, it didn't except out Abbington township and said, but not for you, Abbington township, because you violated the purpose prong. The Sixth Circuit here has adopted a rule that once mistaken, always condemned and we don't think that has any proper place in this Court's establishment of jurisprudence.\n Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Friedman?\n Justice Stevens and may it please the Court, three times in the course of a year, McCreary and Pulaski county posted Ten Commandments displays. They variously describe the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code of Kentucky, the central historic legal document of the State and, finally, as the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal system. In the course of the litigation, they announced that under current law, they announced to the curt that uncurrent law, America is a Christian nation and they acknowledge that the purpose of their second display was to demonstrate America's Christian heritage. In this context, it is our position that the current courthouse display reveals both a purpose and an effect to endorse religion. This Court has repeatedly and most recently in the Santa Fe case made clear that it is necessary to look at the content, the context and the history of a display in order to gauge whether or not there is a true secular purpose or whether or not an asserted secular purpose is a sham. We submit here that on this record, the District Court and particularly in the context of an appeal from a preliminary injunction, which we have here, that the District Court had ample evidence from which it could conclude that the asserted secular purpose of McCreary and Pulaski counties was indeed a sham. The counties announced their purpose not only in the content of the display itself but in the resolution that the counties enacted, the identical resolutions that the counties enacted within weeks after the filing of this lawsuit. And in that resolution, the counties make clear that they relied on and cited approvingly the Kentucky legislature's reference to Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics. They made clear that they supported the fight of Alabama Supreme Court justice Roy Moore against the ACLU. They made absolutely clear in their legal papers that they deemed this to be a Christian nation under current law and they made clear that they absolutely intended and believed they had the right to display the Ten Commandments. They did so not in a display of history. They asserted and they intended to do so because of the religious nature of the Ten Commandments. There can be no doubt that the Ten Commandments portrays a religious point of view and is profoundly religious. The Court said so in Stone. There is no serious question about that. The question then here is whether or not the counties, in their current display, have done anything to sufficiently neutralize the endorsing message that is contained in this record. And we submit it has not done so. It now announces that the Ten Commandments are the foundation of our legal system, not just that religion is but that the Ten Commandments, a particular religious code, the word of God, it asserts is the foundation of our legal system. It asserts that the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God, provides the moral background of the Declaration of Independence. We think it's clear that the content of the Ten Commandments and the content of the Declaration of Independence deal with substantially different topics.\n Suppose you had a county 100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the same display was put on and the recitation was   and it was a sincere recitation, that the government simply wanted to recognize that the 10 Commandments has played an important role in the civic lives of our people. Then you have   they're each up for five years and five years later, some school kids wander by one and they wander by the other. In your view, from what you're telling me, the Commandments are permitted in one location and not the other? I mean, that's the necessary purport of your argument. You may not think that either of them are valid but on this prong of the argument, it seems to me that to differentiate, I just don't understand that.\n I think to an extent there is a differentiation because this Court has made clear that any assessment must depend on context. There is no fixed per se rule but rather, the context one must both look at the purpose and the effect. In gauging the purpose, one looks at both the litigation history, the social facts, the content and any changes. Here the District Court had not only the display itself but it had the announced purpose of the county. It therefore was in a unique position to gauge the purpose of the   the true purpose of these counties. Moreover, it was in a unique position to gauge the effects that the reasonable observer in these small rural Kentucky counties, the reasonable observer assessment of this particular display. And the Court   McCreary County is a county with only 17,000 people. Whitley City, the county seat, which is not even incorporated, has 1,100 people. The District Court from its chambers in London, Kentucky was well situated to gauge whether or not the reasonable observer, knowing the litigation history of this case and knowing the changes in the forum and the context of this display, would perceive this to be a neutral recitation of history or simply the third in a series of efforts by this county government to post the Ten Commandments because that is what it wanted to post.\n Does that mean forever? What I'm thinking   let me spell it out. The key words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten Commandments, because it would lead to, in the circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate, perhaps, and obey. In other words, their reaction to it would likely be a religious reaction. Now, here if you saw it just by itself, perhaps one would be concerned with the intent or the effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred character of the law, which is fine for religious people to do but not necessarily fine for the State to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a religious way. If that's the problem, that would exist here only because of the history or most likely because of the history. And if that is the problem, that would dissipate over time because it is the smallness of the audience and their familiarity with the history that would likely produce the similar religious reaction to the display. Now, what's your reaction?\n I think it's a question of degree and while over time the importance of the purpose may diminish, the purpose does not fully diminish and the effect does not change substantially. It is a question of degree, it is a question of line drawing. Here there is not an effort to incorporate the Ten Commandments into a neutral display or a neutral course of study such as a compare and contrast of ancient moral codes or a comparative religion course such as many of us have taken and schools clearly can offer. It is not a neutral display of law givers like the frieze in this Court. It asserts the primacy of the Ten Commandments. It says the Ten Commandments are the moral background of the Declaration of Independence. It doesn't say there is some commonality between the Ten Commandments and some American laws. It talks not only about law. It talks about our system of government. It says the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God is the moral foundation of the Declaration of Independence. That in itself is an endorsement of religion in this context and I don't think that can dissipate over time.\n Why is it? It may be true. These pilgrims came for religious reasons. If all you have is a display of the origin of the law in the United States, what would be wrong with saying, this is a historical account? It's like teaching religion in the schools. Of course it stemmed from the religious beliefs of those who came to the United States. You don't mean it religiously. You mean it historically.\n It's the difference between acknowledgment and endorsement. Of course counties and other governments can acknowledge the role that religion played in history. That is very different from acknowledging religion as a general matter and asserting that a specific code that is central to specific religions is the one   not only the one religious source but the one source, religious or moral, that provide   religious or secular that provides the moral background of the Declaration of Independence.\n I don't care it stands for that. As you heard, the code takes various forms for various religions. And I think all it stands for is the proposition that the moral order is ordained by God. That's all it stands for. And to say that that's the basis of the Declaration of Independence and of our institutions is entirely realistic.\n What this display says  \n I don't think they're really saying that the particular commandments of the Ten Commandments are the basis of the Declaration of Independence. That's idiotic. What the commandments stand for is the direction of human affairs by God. That's what it stands for.\n Whatever the merit of that statement, that is not what these counties have said. What these counties have said in their resolutions is that the Ten Commandments are the precedent legal code of Kentucky and the central historic legal document of the state. What they have said in this display itself, in the explanation of the display, that they are the moral background of the Declaration of Independence, to the exclusion of all others, in effect. When you say the, it doesn't say one of. It says it is the foundation of our legal system. It doesn't say it had an influence on some of our laws. It asserts the primacy, the actual text of this display asserts the primacy of the Ten Commandments.\n If that's what it means, it's idiotic. I don't think anybody is going to interpret it that way. You can't get the Declaration of Independence out of the Ten Commandments.\n I would agree with that, Your Honor.\n And I don't think that's how somebody would normally read it. I think what they're saying is the principle of laws being ordained by God is the foundation of the laws of this state and the foundation of our legal system.\n How long is that resolution going to guide our view of the future displays or even the present one? What about the membership of the board of supervisors is changed? How long do we look to that particular resolution?\n I think, Your Honor, it's an element that the District Court in the first instance must accept and gauge in determining whether or not the announced secular purpose is indeed a true purpose or is a sham. Where we're talking about a close time period, here three displays in less than a year by the same officials of the same county trying to post the same document, this case becomes very close to the Santa Fe independent school district case where it's a moving target in direct response to pending litigation as an effort to try to get the same end result and changing the operative facts just slightly in the hope that eventually it will be right.\n May I ask you a question on that point? And I should know the answer. It must be in the briefs but I don't remember. I assume that they rescinded the resolution before version 3 of the display was put up, is that correct?\n That is not correct, Your Honor. The resolution was enacted in early December 1999, a couple of weeks after the display. It has never been rescinded.\n It is still on the books?\n It is still on the books. A point is made in the reply brief, it is not a binding resolution, it encourages the county judge executive to post the Ten Commandments as part of a historic display. It doesn't say post a display of documents and have a county judge choose to post the Ten Commandments. The initial paragraph of the resolution makes clear that it encourages the county judge to post the Ten Commandments and then as part of a historic display. The county judge did that. The District Court enjoined that display. The county appealed that injunction and then, after getting new lawyers, dropped its appeal. Soon after that, the county posted a third display, again, the Ten Commandments with what it called historic documents, leaving aside how the Stars Spangled Banner or the national motto as a historic document. What it did is wrap the Ten Commandments in the three or four secular documents that we all clearly acknowledge as the root of the American system of government. It did so pursuant to the same resolution. There has never been another resolution, it has not been rescinded. The resolution is there. It cites Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics, it cites legislative allusions to Jesus Christ. I think the resolution, which is cited in the joint appendix of the docket number, makes it clear that the purpose of this county was to post the Ten Commandments and to do so because of the religious nature of the Ten Commandments because of the primacy in its view of the Ten Commandments. That's what it focused on. That's what this litigation history has revealed throughout and that's what the District Court found at least at the preliminary injunction stage, which is where we still are. There has been no evidence taken in the case, no discovery taken in the case to suggest anything other than what the District Court found. And on this record, I submit that there can be no conclusion other than that the purpose of the county in posting the series of displays was to post the Ten Commandments because of their religious nature and the effect on the reasonable observer who knew what was going on, who was there to see what was transpiring in this small county was clear to the District Court. The District Court doesn't operate in a vacuum. And this Court has made clear that courts cannot turn a blind eye to a sham secular purpose. The District Court not only saw the displays, heard the arguments of counsel, saw the resolutions of the District Court, of the fiscal Court. The fiscal Court is the legislative branch of government in Kentucky. The District Court also was there in the community and could see both the public reaction, the letters to the editor, the keep the Ten Commandments signs on yards throughout the county.\n Is all of that in the record?\n That is not in the record.\n Then I don't think we should talk about it.\n The District Court was well situated to understand the social fact, historical record and arguments of both the lawyers and the parties and the statements of the parties.\n Mr. Friedman, can you tell me where in the joint appendix the resolution appears?\n Joint Appendix page 1, number 5, and it's Exhibit 1 attached to it. And that's the one of the counties. The other one is   and these are the docket entries. The document itself is not in the joint appendix. And the other county is joint appendix page 28, number 6. They're both Exhibit 1s attached to those documents. Those documents are the county's motions to dismiss in the District Court.\n It's not printed?\n It is not in the appendix itself, no. The resolution is not in there. The citation to it from the index is there.\n It is in the record which we have?\n It is in the record. It was submitted in fact by the petitioners in this case. They submitted the resolution in support of their arguments defending the second display, the display that surrounded the Ten Commandments with the religious text. They made clear in that brief that they were asserting their right to display the Ten Commandments as part of their argument that the purpose was to demonstrate America's Christian heritage. I submit that in that brief, in that resolution, in the repeated statements of the county officials and of their counsel, the District Court was well within its discretion to determine that the purpose here was religious, was not secular and that the effect, as viewed by the reasonable observer, was religious   was to endorse religion, not secular. If there are additional questions, I would be happy to answer it.\n The other question I have is assuming you didn't have any of this history and they started off with plan 3, would that have violated the establishment clause?\n Yes, Your Honor, I think it would. It would be a closer question but in this context, what we have is the assertion that the Ten Commandments are the source, the moral background of the Declaration of Independence, the foundation of our legal system. It is not incorporating the Ten Commandments as part of a neutral course of study. It is not like having Moses along with 15 other or 15 law givers. It is the assertion of the primacy of the Ten Commandments.\n I don't understand the difference. I mean it seems to me it would violate the establishment clause, it would equally do so if you said it's a major part of or even a part of. Now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's the exclusive one. It may make it more wrong but we're not grading papers here. It seems to me that whether it violates the establishment clause depends upon whether you're endorsing   whether you're proselytizing religion.\n I think that's correct, Your Honor.\n What does primacy have to do with it?\n I think it makes it an easier case when it asserts this is the one rather than one of several or one of many.\n But your real position is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as they had the Ten Commandments in the display, that would be enough?\n I think it depends on the content and context of the display.\n Exactly what we've got in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying it's the sole source of the primacy. They say it's a source. Does that still violate the establishment clause?\n I think it does, Your Honor.\n Since you have a minute, give me your opinion to the right standard if hypothetically you start with the Goldberg-Schempp idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden by the establishment clause to recognize the religious nature of the people nor the religious origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy to go too far and it's easy in this area you are trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you hoped and really end up with something worse than if you stayed out in the first place. In other words, it's a very delicate matter and it's very easy to offend people. Now, suppose you start with that. You're trying to define what is too far constitutionally speaking. What's your test? Of the many that have been in our opinions, which do you think works the best for that purpose or some other?\n I think the Court's endorsement test has stood the test of time and has worked well. It allows the District Courts that are most familiar with what is actually happening to look at both the purpose and the effect of a particular display. I don't think there can be an ironclad rule. There can be presumptions. There can be brighter line tests perhaps. But I think ultimately  \n Within reason outline an approach that would say a religious display is presumptively for   is a presumptive endorsement. I think with the Baptist brief. Would you endorse that test?\n We think that test can work very well in a context like this where we're talking about the display of religious texts rather than just symbols. And the point I think is well worth considering, that we assume that when people post signs or displays, bumper stickers, buttons, that they endorse the content of that text and that the presumption then would place a burden on government to make sure that it is neutralizing the endorsing effect of displaying text. I think that is a very workable text in a context like this where we're talking about the posting of core religious texts.\n Would you explain why you distinguish text and symbolize them? You distinguish text from the crucifix and so on. Why?\n It does depend entirely on context, to be sure, but symbols are subject to alternative interpretation. Text is not. Or text rarely is. And text such as this, religious text, cannot be seen as anything other than the revealed Word of God. I mean, here we have 120 words in the first four Commandments, 142 in the first five Commandments of this display that is a profound, detailed explication of core religious content, core religious meaning.\n I understand the text part but why not adopt the same test for the symbols? For example, why not adopt it for the Moses? The burden would be on the government to show that it was not approving, endorsing, et cetera, and in this context, that would be pretty easy. Why not have the same test?\n There is no reason why it couldn't be applied just as well. My point was simply that it's even easier to do it when there is text. The Court doesn't need to go so far as to decide whether to apply it to both text and symbol, though it certainly could. It need only go so far as say when government posts religious texts, it must be presumed to endorse the content of that text. It's a little more difficult when you're talking about symbols, depending on what the symbols are. Some symbols are far more sectarian such as the Cross, such as the Star of David, than other symbols. At least when there is text involved, one presumes that the display of text is an endorsement of the content of that text unless the content and the context make clear that it is neutralizing. The examples are obvious. The display of religious art in a government owned art museum, the playing of religious music by a government symphony orchestra, the context of the orchestra, the context of the museum are sufficient to neutralize the religious message that is contained in the display itself. Here   and the same thing I think would be said of a comparative religion course or a compare and contrast ancient moral code course. There there is not an endorsement of a particular code, a particular text but rather a neutral educational display about several alternative ones. That is different from taking one religious code, one revealed Word of God, placing it next to the revered documents that frame the American Republic and saying, these are all alike, these are worthy of equal reverence. That is simply wrapping the Ten Commandments in the flag and, with all due respect, that constitutes endorsement. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Friedman. Mr. Staver, you have about three minutes left.\n Justice Stevens, the argument before this Court was unlike anything that went down in the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals because never was a resolution ever mentioned. Never did the District Court or the Sixth Circuit ever discuss the resolution. It was not mentioned in this Court until this answer brief by respondents was filed. It is not part of the District Court's decision, it was not part of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Court said that what imprinted every action thereafter with defiance in a taint is the mere posting of the first display. There was no resolution for that display, none is needed. There is no resolution for the foundations display.\n Was there a resolution, Counsel?\n For the second display, yes, Your Honor, there was.\n And whatever is in the record is that resolution?\n It is that resolution but it is specific to the second display because it specifically mentions what kind of documents are in that display. It is not a general display regarding posting of documents. In this case, when of the Court  \n But is it correct that it was not amended when the third display was created?\n It was not amended because it was not   it was relevant and fact-specific in the display itself.\n It is the last expression of the governing body's intent?\n No, Your Honor. What's the last expression is the foundations display which clearly a reasonable observer would see. And if there is any doubt regarding  \n But there hasn't been a new resolution.\n There is not a new resolution.\n And that one wasn't rescinded?\n That one died, Your Honor, with the Court's ruling.\n It was adopted and it still is there, presumably?\n Presumably. There is nothing in the record that suggests what happened to it. Whether it was repealed or not. But it was specific factually only to that second display, not to the foundations display which the District Court found was fundamentally different. And if there is any doubt regarding the history of purpose, we would suggest, Justice O'Connor, your suggestion in the Wallace, that if there is any doubt regarding purpose, to look to the effects prong. And I think when you look to the effects prong, a reasonable observer will see that this is a constitutional display. This case is one in which the Sixth Circuit drew the most difficult hate, it imposed it in a subsequent action in the most difficult area of the establishment clause and clearly the public officials have substantially and fundamentally changed. They can't live under this taint forever. They tried but they could to correct their way. They tried what they could to display this in a constitutional manner so that anyone passing by would see this as one document among many others. In addition to the display itself, with all the other hundreds of documents that are on the wall, this display has a specific stated purpose.\n So presumably these things are open if it goes on to the final hearing? The preliminary injunction stage?\n Yes, the preliminary injunction. And the fact that the resolution is technically latent on the books, they are will repeal that, they repudiate that resolution. Thank you.\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n The honorable Court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.\n Good morning, Justice Stevens. May it please the Court: I will begin with that, if you would like. This case is not moot because there is an ongoing case or controversy between the parties. There is a judgment, it is true, from the Delaware State court, which has now been affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court. But preclusion doctrines not Rooker-Feldman and not mootness govern the resolution of the claims that we asserted first  \n Well, what financial interests do your clients have to keep litigating today in another court?\n I don't know the  \n What's going on? I mean, it's very confusing.\n Well, certainly, Justice O'Connor, we've not yet recovered on our judgment and that judgment is still there. It is still in existence. We've not yet collected on it. But I don't believe that mootness turns on whether you have, in fact, collected on a judgment. There are very few cases out there in which a party has, in fact, obtained two judgments, one from a State court and one from a Federal court, usually because a party waived the application of preclusion doctrines. And   and we have conceded previously that that's not our interest. What is our interest here is that we have asserted Federal jurisdiction. This case was brought in Federal court by SABIC. During the course of discovery, we found some things out that they had been overcharging us and we indicated that we were going to bring claims against them in Federal court. They ran down to Delaware court by forum shopping in order to try to obtain a shorter statute of limitations, which turned out for them to be a strategic blunder of monumental proportions. But the Federal case, when we filed it, those claims had original jurisdiction in Federal court. They have not yet been resolved in a proper way. We  \n But do you have a continuing case or controversy? That was   that   that's a bedrock Article III requirement, and if you've got all the relief that you were seeking   let's put it this way. Suppose your opponent SABIC says, here's the check for the $417 million and we undertake that we're not going to pursue any further relief. Would you have a case or controversy left?\n Yes, Your Honor. We might not have an interest in pursuing the case, but we have a legal interest in terms of Article III case or controversy. It is well established that the   the fact of taking a judgment does not make a case moot. In fact, if there were a holding that we think that the Federal case were moot  \n But if you've got all the relief to which you are entitled, that does make a case moot.\n In terms of cases that involve injunctive relief where it is impossible for a court to give you the relief that you have   that you are seeking, that is true. But when you are seeking money damage, it is at least theoretically possible   we're not saying that we're going to ask for that, but at least theoretically possible that the Federal district court could still give us relief. And therefore, what we are asking for is  \n What relief could it give you?\n But what for?\n What relief? If you're paid in full, what   what relief are you entitled to?\n Well, we think the relief that we're entitled to, in terms of this, is for the case to be remanded for the district court to resolve these issues under preclusion doctrines.\n But what issues would   would the district court resolve?\n Preclusion.\n Well, if you win on the preclusion  \n Who cares?\n   what do you get then in substance?\n We don't necessarily intend to take a   another judgment in Federal court.\n Then what do you intend to do? If you win on preclusion, what do you do then?\n Well, hopefully we'll win on preclusion with respect not only to this suit, the New Jersey II suit, but also the New Jersey I suit, which we say the district   or the Delaware judgment precludes.\n Well, I think we'd like an answer. Justice Ginsburg gives us   gives you a hypothetical case. You've got the money. The judgment has been discharged in the State courts. What is left to do in the Federal court?\n It is likely  \n Now, the one answer I heard you give, well, we're interested in preclusion to say   well, that's all historical at that point. Who cares?\n It   it is likely, Your Honor   and we have previously said   that we may very well dismiss the case of our own accord. But that doesn't mean  \n We're looking for   we're looking for something that makes the case live.\n Our claims are alive. There are claims there that seek relief  \n But we're   we're questioning why that is and we're asking you what relief you need to get that you wouldn't get in the hypothetical that Justice Ginsburg posed.\n We thought we would not seek further monetary relief.\n So what  \n Do you know how many claims in this case that   that were not in the Delaware case?\n We have affirmative defenses to the New Jersey I, but   but the claims in New Jersey II and Delaware are the same, Your Honor.\n Is your answer that you might want equitable relief, an injunction to continue making payments in the future, or something like that?\n No, Your Honor. We're not seeking additional monetary or equitable relief.\n You   you would be stuck anyway because you made a counterclaim and   and it would be   on which you prevailed. And in that counterclaim you would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything that you could get. But   but at this stage at least, the   the door   there   there is still conceivably an avenue of further litigation because, SABIC hasn't yet said that it's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to petition for cert, for example.\n And, indeed, Your Honor. I mean, SABIC has represented to the Court that it likely intends to seek certiorari relief from this Court in the Delaware suit.\n So it has  \n So if they do, it's not finished.\n It is not finished  \n Yes, all right. I'll ask them that.\n Getting back to the Rooker-Feldman issue, which is the issue on which the Court granted cert, Rooker-Feldman is a narrow, limited doctrine, but it bars only appellate review not parallel litigation in Federal district courts. Rooker-Feldman is not a theory of vanishing original jurisdiction, nor is it a jurisdictional substitute for the preclusion analysis mandated by Congress in the Full Faith and Credit Act. The expansive interpretation asserted by SABIC misperceives the fundamental nature of appellate review. It's untethered to any natural negative implication in 28 U.S.C. 1257. It illegitimately displaces the application of section 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act, in most cases to which it is traditionally applied, and it serves absolutely no useful purpose.\n Well, the problem that bothers me   and I don't know that there's an answer to it   is you have plaintiff. Plaintiff goes into State court. He brings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit. And then he decides he'd also like to go to Federal court. He brings exactly the same suit. And here we have two suits and exactly the same thing running along at the same time. Now, I know there are principles from this Court's case law that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen. They've always bothered me. But now let's take a special instance. The special instance is that in court one in the State, the plaintiff loses. Now, what he decides to do is to say to the Federal court, we want you to review what they did in the State court. Can't do that. Right?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Okay. So he brilliantly figures out I will omit the word review from my   from my motion. I will ask for precisely the same thing just not use that word review. I will ask them to go and make their decision which happens to be   in my opinion should be   100 percent the opposite of what the State court did showing they're wrong. But I won't use the word review. Now, you say because he cut the word review out, he can do it.\n No, Justice Breyer. It's not because he cut the review out. Rooker-Feldman is an issue of appellate   the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. So what does appellate jurisdiction mean? Well, appellate  \n Mr. Coleman, would you clarify, I think, in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry? Rooker-Feldman both involved State court litigation that was over and done with. Then you come to the Federal court. You have two parallel cases would be   brought within a month of each other?\n Within 2 months of each other. Within a month of each other, Your Honor.\n And isn't the standard defense of the person who has started the other suit first, well, Your Honor, prior action pending, please hold the case that started second in abeyance till we get done? And if we win in the first case, then it will be precluded. Then the second case   the parallel case will be precluded. That's not Rooker-Feldman territory.\n That's   that's   Your Honor, that's our position that   concurrent jurisdiction is a separate issue from the appellate review issue that Rooker-Feldman raises. Justice Breyer, the answer to your hypothetical is that appellate review is something different from having a parallel action. Appellate review is probably best defined by two characteristics that I'll try to flesh out for you. The first is that the proponent alleges some sort of injury-causing error by the trial court and not by the adversary and then seeks an order reversing, vacating, or otherwise nullifying that lower court order. When a party alleges an injury by his adversary rather than the trial court, the most that can really be said is that you are continuing on a parallel litigation but not that you are seeking appellate review. You do not have what looks like appellate review. You're not alleging errors by the lower court. You're not seeking an order that directly nullifies or otherwise undoes the State court judgment.\n No, but the argument   it seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when you try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the State case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in some sense to review what happened in the State court. Justice Ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the answer. Is that your answer?\n Absolutely.\n Because if that   if that is   if we accept that as the answer, then there's no argument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to include the de facto review as opposed to the   the very strict sense of review that you're talking about.\n That is absolutely our position, Justice Souter, that preclusion addresses all of these issues.\n Well, but can you   can you expand on this a little? I'm not taking a view on it. I'm trying to clear up what's a confusion in my mind. I see how you could do this on the parallel business with   with delaying it on the docket and using the doctrine of preclusion. I understand that. But we've still got this doctrine called Rooker Feldman out there, and as long as you have that doctrine, it strikes me as odd if   say, it weren't a plaintiff. Say it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the Federal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket. Let's move it up. Let's decide it now. He doesn't use the word review, but everything else is the same. He wants a decision out of that court that is going to be the opposite of what the State court did. And what's concerning me   maybe I shouldn't be concerned, but what's concerning me is whether he can get it or not seems to turn completely on whether he uses the word review in the petition.\n I don't   I don't think that that is true. It should not and does not turn on the words that you use in your petition. What it turns on is the fundamental nature of the injury that you claim and of the relief that you seek. One reason why you don't need to be necessarily concerned about this is that in all of these cases in which one case has gone to judgment and there is a   either a continuation or a new case, preclusion is going to cover these. The only extension of Rooker-Feldman that SABIC is asking for is what they call the actually litigated test. That is the heart of the Full Faith and Credit Act.\n Rooker-Feldman, if I understand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction bar. Is that  \n Yes, Your Honor. It  \n Yes. And  \n   it arises from a negative implication taken from section 1257 and a second negative implication from 1331.\n Well, to   so if the two lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit   they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.\n Yes.\n To apply Rooker-Feldman in that context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction at the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the line.\n And   and   yes, Justice Ginsburg. And that's a distinction between your hypothetical and Justice Breyer's. Justice Breyer's, as I   if I understand it correctly, is that the Federal suit starts after the State court is done. Yours is where you have parallel actions at the same time. And where the Federal claims are parallel or even filed first, as in our case, you can't say that the moment you file those that you're seeking review of some nonexistent State court judgment. You're simply asking for relief from something that your adversary did to you. And the argument that SABIC makes that the court relinquishes jurisdiction has no basis or justification in anything this Court has ever said. It is a theory of vanishing jurisdiction that I cannot understand.\n Suppose  \n Mr. Coleman, can I interrupt with a question?\n Of course.\n Is it your position that what should have been done in this case, not in the hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just stayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware case?\n And, in fact, that's what the Federal district court had done, Your Honor.\n And that's what   he did   that was correct.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n And then when the Delaware case was over, then what should he have done?\n Well, we could either ultimately dismiss it or the Federal district court could say, looks like your Delaware case is over. SABIC brings a motion  \n And   and he has given you all the relief your entitled to. Therefore, you go ahead and dismiss the case.\n Yes, or SABIC brings a motion  \n And therefore, my next question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.\n Because the question before the Court today is a question of jurisdiction, not of practical consequences other than the mootness question that SABIC has raised. But practical consequences are that what we may  \n Well, maybe we could vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong, but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the judgment.\n I think, as in Feldman, that's a question that should be first addressed by the district court. Certainly we hope that you will vacate or reverse the Third Circuit's judgment and allow the district court to address those issues. Perhaps we dismiss it.\n But if you don't tell us what issue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct the suit to be dismissed.\n There   there is a live   in   in the terms of Article III, there are live claims that remain pending before the district court. And while it is true  \n And I take it that's because you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first action and you don't have the check.\n At the very minimum  \n Okay. It's   if the 3 months is expired and the check is in your hand and it's certified, what's left?\n As a practical matter, we have no intention. As a jurisdictional matter, there's still  \n I'm not asking about your intention. Let's assume you do intend to litigate further. What for?\n If we did intend to litigate further, SABIC would be entitled to go to the district court and say they can't. They are precluded.\n I want   I want an answer to my question. What are you going to litigate for? What's left?\n Well, again, setting aside our intentions and hypothetically, there are cases in which  \n I'm talking about your case. What's left?\n We   we do not seek   will not seek any further review from the district court.\n Nothing is left.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Now, suppose you don't have the check. What's left?\n Well, the case is still up in the air.\n Why?\n Because  \n You have a judgment.\n   the case   the case is not over. Indeed, because the State  \n I never heard of a case that isn't over until you get the check. I thought the case is over when you have the judgment. (Laughter.)\n And then if they don't give you the check, you have a different matter. We have to get it enforced.\n There is a different matter. But as a matter of Article III jurisdiction, Your Honor, the   the mootness doctrine does not apply to a situation where you have a judgment and it doesn't necessarily apply the moment you get paid.\n Suppose that you lost in the State court and the judgment is final. You then go to Federal court. Are   is there a context in which Rooker Feldman might then be applicable? This is all hypothetical.\n Our argument is that it would be applicable only if the injury that we claimed in our Federal suit was an injury caused by the State court   the court itself or the judge rather than our adversary and we sought relief from that judgment. That would obtain the nature of appellate jurisdiction rather than we say, well, SABIC did us wrong, we'd like a judgment. And then SABIC can come in and say, well, they're precluded. They already tried that.\n In other words, if you had some ongoing relation and, in this hypothetical, the State court ruled against you and you went in to try to reverse that ruling, that would be   that would Rooker-Feldman.\n Yes. If we alleged harm from the court and sought relief from the court's judgment.\n There were only the two cases, Rooker and Feldman, that established this.\n Yes.\n Has this Court ever said anything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from preclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation instead of you go into Federal court after the State court is over and you're trying to undo what the State court did?\n I don't think this Court has ever held any such thing, and I think it would be inconsistent with at least Feldman itself. The idea of   of appellate jurisdiction over the constitutional claims in Feldman that were held not to be barred comes down in the end   SABIC says, well, those claims weren't actually litigated. But the opinion itself on page 467 points out that the Mr. Feldman had raised his constitutional claims in front of the D.C. Court of Appeals in terms of asking for his waiver. And when I checked the oral argument transcript from the Feldman case, it was mentioned specifically in terms of Mr. Feldman had raised the constitutional claims in front of the D.C. Court. And that's on pages 9, 14, and 16 of the LEXIS version of the oral argument transcript.\n But there's no preclusion unless they're also decided.\n Yes. Well, yes. The district court could then decide whether in fact they were precluded, and   and it's likely that they were. I didn't follow up on what happened when the case went back down on remand. But the Court said, we're not going to decide that. We will allow the district court to address that in the first instance. And so we think that the actually litigated revision of Rooker-Feldman is simply inconsistent with Feldman itself, that it improperly displaces full faith and credit that is not true to the negative implication from section 1257 which has to be a very narrow implication, indeed, because 1257 gives this Court jurisdiction, and it's only appellate jurisdiction, to suggest that another court doesn't have that appellate jurisdiction must be   must be narrowly limited to the context, the type of lawsuits that this Court would seek, which is not simply they did me wrong, please   please give me money, but rather, that lower court erred. It violated my rights. It is structurally or in some   in violation of Federal rights or something that the court did and that you have been asked to fix. That, we think, is consistent with the proper negative implication from 1257, but overrunning most of preclusion law simply is not. For these reasons, we would ask the Court to reverse. And, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n You may do so. Mr. Castanias. I hope you'll tell us also whether you think the case is moot before you're through.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case is moot. There is nothing for Exxon Mobil to get at this  \n Well, you're still asking for cert.\n That's right, and that's  \n Well, then why is it moot? Because something could happen. We might get this case in theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision, and should that happen, there luckily for them they have this other case going. So as long as   you're prepared, I take it, to say you're going to ask for cert. If that's what you're going to say, I don't see how the case is over. It's up to you.\n Okay. Well, I'm   I'm not going to take the Hobson's choice, Your Honor, but I am going to tell you, first of all, that SABIC is going to apply for cert. At least that's my current understanding. And second of all, that shows why this case is not justiciable at this point because if the most likely event in the   in the event of this Court's review of the Delaware determination, is a reversal on a statute of limitations problem. That's the reason this suit was brought as the, quote, insurance policy that the Third Circuit identified, which was if the Delaware Supreme Court or the Delaware Superior Court had kicked this suit on the ground of the 3-year statute of limitations   and if you look at page 20a of the supplemental brief, the corrected supplemental brief that we filed with the Court, including the Delaware Supreme Court's opinion, you'll see that they had a whale of a time getting over the plain language of their own statute.\n All right. If for   somehow you won on that, even though it sounds a little like a State law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and they reversed it as a statute of limitations, then what they're saying is, well, that's just why we filed in Federal court. We didn't want the Federal court to review the State court. We wanted our Federal court suit as an insurance policy in case something goes wrong with the State court suit. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Rooker-Feldman. It is parallel adjudication, just what he said. Now, what's your response?\n My response, Justice Breyer, is twofold. First of all, with regard to the mootness question, if that eventuality occurs, that's the time when there may be a justiciable issue for a Federal district court. Not now. We've been talking about ifs and hypotheticals and what may happen in the future.\n Mr. Castanias, was there a proper case in the district court when the complaint was initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in Delaware?\n We've never disputed that, Justice Ginsburg.\n All right. So you can bring two cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and that's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action pending.\n Right.\n Now, you are urging that Rooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine. Why would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to me rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you rush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo that State court judgment, I don't like it? Rooker was just a paradigm case of that. Why would you want to spread that doctrine? What is   what is there that preclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, preclusion doctrine may accomplish this in a certain number of cases, but I think it's important   and I think I have to correct my colleague on the other side here with regard to the state of the record. Yes, there was a stay of the New Jersey II trial court litigation, but it wasn't because of the Colorado River application that we made. In fact, if you'll look in the appendix to the petition  \n Well, I'm not talking about anything fancy like Colorado River. Prior action pending is a familiar defense. You've got two actions. They could even be in different districts of the same State and one says, Your Honor, this case started second, the other one is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a prior action pending. That's not Colorado River abstention or anything like that.\n Well, I   I think, Your Honor, you will see that that is a component of Colorado River, and that was part of the application that we made to the district court in this case under Colorado River. And my only answer   the only reason that I'm bringing this up, Justice Ginsburg, is that if you'll look in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, you will see that SABIC, my client, made an application for Colorado River abstention, and the district court denied that. The district court denied that in this case.\n Well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but   but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court   they're all bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, so we're going to agree. You agreed that the case would go forward in Delaware, the trial in Delaware. Is that not so?\n Well, it was   it was   if you'll look at   I believe this is at page 8a of the addendum to the red brief. You'll see that it was Exxon Mobil that pushed in Delaware, but that actually happened before the ruling on sovereign immunity, that   that they elected to go forward in Delaware.\n Well, when you say they pushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a   in a reverse suit. You wanted a declaration of non liability.\n Right.\n They brought their case for liability in the Federal forum. They were forced by you into the Delaware forum, and now you're saying you were pushed, that Exxon pushed. You brought the case in Delaware. They didn't.\n We   that is true that we brought the initial case, but the case was eventually tried on their counterclaims. The case was inverted to make them the party plaintiff. They went first at trial and is it   at the page I cited to you, that was where they decided to go forward with the Delaware case.\n But it was your preferred forum, not theirs. When they filed their complaint, they filed it in New Jersey where they had a related case pending. So you chose the forum.\n That   that is absolutely the case with regard to the Delaware matter. But I think what your question is getting at   and I think I have to go back a couple of minutes in our colloquy here to talk about why abstention won't do the work in this case. In the lion's share of cases, it probably will, Your Honor, but in this case it didn't. And this brings me back to Justice Breyer's question which said   in which he said that   that concurrent jurisdiction has always bothered him because what you're ending up with is a race to judgment. But it's important again, Justice Breyer. It's a race to judgment.\n Well, that's   you see, Justice Ginsburg answered that. I   I mean, she wasn't answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that   that the second person says, you know, Judge, there's another one pending and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except in some unusual instance.\n Which happens thousands of times in   in all of the courts. It's very common and I don't know why we're over-designing this vehicle. It's simply other action pending. End of case.\n Justice Kennedy  \n Or end of argument, not end of case. (Laughter.)\n So why isn't it that the end? I mean, here it's not moot. They filed the other action. You point out that you not only think something could wreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the State claim. And   and therefore, they have this insurance policy in Federal court which they'll gear up if and when the State claim does get wrecked as you hope.\n Justice Breyer, I think this is the point in the argument where I want to turn to the definition of review as this Court has   has put it forth in cases like ASARCO. This is a case that Exxon Mobil dismisses in their reply brief as mere dictum. I don't think that this   the discussion of Rooker-Feldman and the ASARCO case can be dismissed as dictum in that it was a specific response to a specific proposal by the United States appearing as amicus to dismiss the case for lack of standing and instead remit plaintiffs to pursuing a second suit. In that case, the Court wrote that to re adjudicate   and I'm quoting here from the opinion, and I don't have the particular page here   to re-adjudicate the very same issues that were determined in the State court proceedings would be   again quoting   in essence, an attempt to obtain direct review of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the lower Federal courts. In ASARCO, there was no reference to what the intent of the plaintiffs was. There was no reference to what the timing of the lawsuits was. It was simply that identical issues actually litigated.\n So perhaps the Court, if it had been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of Rooker-Feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has been decided. It is claim-precluded. That's what preclusion doctrine is supposed to do. So in that context, maybe this Court used the wrong word. Maybe it should have said, you litigated it, it's over and done with, now it's precluded. Why do you need to interject the word review? Isn't that   unless you're going to say every time court A decides a case and then you're in court B and someone is raising the same claim, that is a review of court number one rather than you're precluded in court two because of what is   has been litigated and decided in court one.\n Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, I'm hesitant to say that this Court was incautious in its use of words. This was  \n It is sometimes.\n But   understandably, but   but with regard to   with regard to Rooker-Feldman, it was not just   it was not just an accidental   incidental invocation of it. It was the reason for the rejection of the argument. The reason was not res judicata. The reason was respect for the dignity of the State court's work in the case, and that's ultimately  \n That's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere. That's what preclusion doctrine is all about. We respect the judgment of the court that rendered it. We, therefore, give it full faith and credit. That's what preclusion doctrine is about, is about respect and credit. Isn't that so?\n That's   that's   that is   that is generally right, Justice Ginsburg, but at the same time, there   we all agree   Exxon Mobil, SABIC, and the decisions of this Court   that there has to be some overlap with regard to Rooker-Feldman and SABIC   and   excuse me   and   and preclusion doctrine. The   the argument made by Exxon Mobil, which is, in essence, the same question you're asking me, would have destroyed any reason whatsoever for the Rooker and the Feldman cases, as well as the ASARCO case. There's also a significant body of law that's body of law that's been built up over the last 85 years in the lower courts in   in this regard. And  \n But you  \n So some of the lower courts have given a broad interpretation to Rooker-Feldman and have turned it into something other than the narrower view of it. And I think that's why we granted cert in this case, to decide whether to give it a broad or a narrow interpretation. The Third Circuit applies a rather broad interpretation of it.\n Well, I   I guess in that respect, Justice O'Connor, I disagree because the Third Circuit, admitted by its own words, applies a very narrow version of Rooker-Feldman. And, in fact, using this case as the vehicle to decide this, the   the definition of Rooker-Feldman in this instance amounts to no more than barring jurisdiction in a second Federal suit over the identical claims. This is not a case where you have to worry about claims that might have been brought, the sort of things that footnote 16 in Feldman dealt with.\n But maybe that isn't a proper application of Rooker-Feldman where the complaint is not about something the State court has improperly done.\n Well  \n It isn't. And so in that sense, the Third Circuit has a rather broader view of it I'd say.\n Well, to be sure, Justice O'Connor, the Third Circuit's view is broader than that which appears to be adopted by the Ninth Circuit, as well as the Seventh Circuit. And I think this brings me back to the definition of review. The   the Ninth and Seventh Circuits' views in our estimation are wrong because they strictly look to the subjective intent of the plaintiff and as to whether the plaintiff is, in fact, seeking reversal. That   that's the term that's used in these cases. Noel says seeking to set aside. But section 1257  \n Of course, that's the language that was used in both Rooker and Feldman too I think.\n And that's because, Justice Stevens, that's   that was the particular fact pattern of this   of that case.\n And that's the only fact pattern any of our cases have dealt with.\n That's   in the Supreme Court, that's right.\n And the   and the concern is I think   at least as I understand the   the concern with it, it   it boils down to something like this. Somebody comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion. Don't apply it because, for whatever reason, there's this   there's something wrong here, and   and Federal court should determine the   in fact, the   the claim preclusion of the State judgment should not apply. The answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by way of appeal of your State judgment. You don't appeal State judgments in Federal court. Out. There's no such claim being made here. The only claim that's being made here or the only conceivable claim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might want to do some litigating in the Federal case after the State case is over. There's no claim here that claim preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about is simply claim preclusion doctrine. There's no reason to add a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if they try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice Ginsburg says, you   you plead claim preclusion. Simple. Why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?\n Well, Justice Souter, I   I don't have any qualms with the application of claim preclusion here. The   the Third Circuit, though, was being   was being sensitive to the interests of the State courts, as well as sensitive to the fact that it had another jurisdictional issue in front of it, which was subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. And I'm   I'm certain, as certain can be, that that court would have reached the same result if res judicata had been before it. But the   the fact is that Rooker-Feldman is there and, again, as   as with my response to Justice Ginsburg earlier, your   your question would effectively rub out any need for even Rooker and Feldman themselves.\n Well, no, because the   it   it would not rule out the need to have some answer when someone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be. Don't apply the claim preclusion rules. There's something unfair about doing it here. The answer to that is, look, what you're really asking us to do, when you say don't apply claim preclusion, is to review what happened in the State court, and we don't sit as an appellate court on State courts. So there's still something for Rooker Feldman to do on, as it were, Justice   Justice Ginsburg's claim preclusion argument.\n Well, Justice Souter, I think again, with respect to the hypothetical that you've put to me, the claim preclusion is appropriately  \n It'll get the   it'll get the job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point.\n It   it should get the job done.\n Why won't it?\n Well, there   there are   first of all, there are no guarantees. The   the preclusion doctrines are   are riddled with exceptions.\n Then   then you  \n The preclusion doctrine  \n Then   then you appeal. Don't ask for a new body of law. Just say, look, you got the application of claim preclusion wrong in this case. We're going to appeal.\n I   I disagree, Justice Souter, that   that we're asking for anything like a huge, new body of law or that the Third Circuit was making a huge, new body of law.\n Well, you're asking us to extend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken it, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for this. The Third Circuit injected Rooker-Feldman into the case. Is that not true?\n Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but it's true because of the briefing cycle. When we briefed the case, there was no Delaware judgment. And it was only on the eve of oral argument  \n Ms. Castanias  \n Yes.\n   could   could I come back to mootness? One   one could say that not only is claim preclusion the answer to Rooker-Feldman, it's also the answer to the asserted mootness here. I mean, you   you don't have to move to dismiss it as moot. All you have to do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that has resolved this question. Do you know of any case in which the existence of a prior judgment in another court has been held to render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second judgment moot? I mean, you'd think there would be a case on that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that because the other side is always going to plead res judicata.\n Well, or the other side is going to give up.\n Or give up. But is there any case in which mootness is established by the fact that there is a prior judgment of another court giving you what you are asking for from this Court?\n Well, Justice Scalia, in the   in the realm that we're talking about here, the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Friedman's case came to a mootness conclusion. We've also cited in our brief   and I don't recall the names of them off the top of my head   two cases in which the Court either   either dismissed or remanded for consideration of mootness in light of another State court judgment. So I think there is   there is a body of law, but I also know that it is   as recently as yesterday looking at Wright and Miller on this issue, that when complete relief has been accorded by another tribunal, that is the classic case of mootness.\n Well, I   I don't know why   well, if it's   if it were so classic, there would be a lot of cases, and I don't   I'm not sure that any of yours are right on point. And   and I think the reason is that you don't need it, that claim preclusion is   is the remedy for the party who wants to get out of it.\n Well, and again, I'm   I'm certainly not going to fight claim preclusion because this is a suit that should not be here. This is   this has had moving parts since we   since the petition was granted with the Delaware Supreme Court ruling and now with yesterday's denial of reargument in the Delaware Supreme Court. What  \n Why is it moot? Or even on   why does claim preclusion apply? I mean, if you win, from what you've said   somehow convince us that this refusal to apply the State statute of limitations properly violated some Federal law, let's say   then that would show that the State statute of limitations applied and barred their claim. Would that be sufficient to knock out the Federal suit too?\n I'm not sure I understand the question, Justice Breyer.\n I mean, is   does the State statute of limitations, if   if it applied to the State's case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the identical ground that everybody agrees that the State statute governs?\n The   the   there could be   there could be issue-preclusive grounds on such a ruling, Justice Breyer, but   but  \n I mean, if you   if you win, then   then   if you win your State case, because of the argument you made, do you also automatically win the Federal case? Is it the same issue?\n I   I don't think I could say that at this point because  \n So it may not be the same issue. Then   then they say, okay, it's not going to be claim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's not the same issue, it's not claim preclusion. And therefore, they could proceed with their Federal case, which is what they want to do I guess.\n And   and that is a future event.\n Yes. So we can't say it's moot in any   and we can't say there's an alternative basis where they'd win, can we? I mean, I'm saying   I'm thinking if we get into conference, we're discussing this case, and I say, well, I have to think this through, is it the case that if you're right and you end up winning in this Court, that their case in Federal court is over? I think no, it may not be. The answer is it may not be. Then this is not moot at all. This is not claim-precluded at all. They then might proceed with their Federal claim.\n Well, I   I guess, Justice Breyer  \n Is that right or not?\n I don't think it's right.\n Because?\n And   and I think the reason it's not right is because that just shows that there's no live controversy right now. That's a controversy that might happen in the future.\n Oh, well, but that   that isn't fair to them because, for all I know, they filed the Federal case because there's a different statute of limitations, say, that governs it that will have expired if you don't let them file it by the time   until this whole thing is over. They just wanted it as protection.\n Well, two answers to that, Justice Breyer. First of all, that seems to be a   a place for State doctrines of tolling to apply, not Federal law. Second of all, this Court in   in Heck against Humphrey, which we cited in our brief, solves this  \n That's explaining the unclear by the incredibly hard to understand.\n I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.\n It's explaining the unclear by reference to the incomprehensible. But go ahead. (Laughter.)\n I think I wrote that opinion. (Laughter.)\n And indeed, you did, Justice Scalia.\n I never did like it. (Laughter.)\n I   I've also gotten that impression. But   but Heck I think teaches an important   Heck teaches an important lesson for this case as well, which is that Heck was just a suit for money damages, just like this suit. And   and yet, this Court said that there's going to be no cause of action under section 1983 because of the intersection of 1983 and habeas. Well, we have the same result here. There should be no Federal court case here because of the intersection of section 1257  \n No, no, because it's where you walk in the door. And you started out by saying this case, I think as you must, was a proper Federal case. It was properly filed in   and it was properly filed in Delaware. So you can't talk about a case that says, if you've got this kind of case, you go in this door. If that kind of case, you go in that door. You have a case here that could go in either door, the Federal, the State. The usual rule is, is it not, that if Federal jurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of subsequent events. For example, if a defendant moves into the plaintiff's State and the only basis for Federal jurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction isn't lost, is it?\n No, and in fact, the case that's cited against us for that proposition, the Freeport McMoran case, makes clear, in the portion of it not cited by Exxon Mobil, that that rule is limited to the diversity context. And it's not   it   it does not have its genesis in statute, but it's in policy. We don't want to keep people from moving across State lines. We don't want to   want to impede their   their free movement. So we're going to look at it at the time of filing. But what we have here is a case where maybe it was original jurisdiction when the case was filed, but it's not original anymore.\n Maybe. It's not   it's not maybe  \n Well, in this case, yes. In this case, yes. But original jurisdiction when the case was filed but not anymore because there's nothing original about it.\n A case can become moot, but we've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is the fate of this case. The notion   you used it derisively   the insurance policy. Lawyers bring protective actions all the time, don't they? There's nothing wrong with doing that.\n Well, I guess I come back to   to where I started with Justice Breyer on the   on the merits of the Rooker-Feldman issue this morning, which is that the concurrent jurisdiction is something to be dealt with. This Court has an uneasy body of law in the abstention area dealing with the issue of concurrent jurisdiction, but what it doesn't have is anything that deals with judgments, once you get to a judgment.\n May I ask you? It's perhaps an unfair question. The Chief Justice generally likes to confine our attention to cases of this Court rather than the courts of appeals for our primary guidance, and most of the Rooker-Feldman law is court of appeals law, as we   we both know. Going back just to Rooker and to Feldman, those two cases, and putting aside ASARCO for a minute, which of those two cases do you think provides you the stronger support, if indeed any support, between Rooker and Feldman?\n Well, I   I would have to say that Feldman, of the two of them, is probably stronger support.\n And that is the case in which the court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.\n That's right. But at the same time, the   the Rooker case also dealt with relitigation of the identical issues. And if I could just sum up here, seeing that the light is on here, the issue in this case is limited to identical lawsuits, identical claims. The Third Circuit's decision in this case, if it constitutes an extension of Rooker-Feldman at all, is only a modest extension because it recognizes, consistent with ASARCO, consistent with Heck, and consistent with the very notion, Justice Souter, of de facto appeals, not actual appeals, but de facto appeals being prohibited by the doctrine   it recognizes that claims actually litigated in a State suit to a judgment, if they are litigated anew in the Federal court, that is de facto appellate review. The judgment of the Third Circuit should be affirmed.\n Thank you, Mr. Castanias. Mr. Coleman, you have 8 and a half minutes left.\n And I'll take just a few of them, Your Honor. I believe the concession that the Federal court exercised original jurisdiction at the time our case was filed is an important concession because I simply do not see yet still any rationale for this idea of vanishing original jurisdiction. I also see the concession made in response to   to your question, Justice Breyer, about what happens if they win on the statute of limitations issue. Well, one of the cases they cite on page 12, footnote 5 of their brief, the Northern Natural Gas case itself makes clear   and there are other cases. They went to Delaware to apply the Delaware statute of limitations. They conceded in front of the Delaware Supreme Court that even if they had won that, it wouldn't bar another lawsuit in a different forum applying a different statute of limitations. The only way they could even hope to get the shorter statute was in Delaware. The Delaware statute would never apply to our Federal claims, so that if somehow it went back on that procedural ground, it would not bar a trial in Federal court. We don't think that that's likely to happen, but that is another explanation yet of why it's moot. We also cited to the Court the Male case. It is an old case, but it does make clear that when there is the question of jurisdiction before the court and some other court rules on the merits, that does not make the case moot. In fact, you really wouldn't have a need for claim preclusion if that were the rule in   in mootness, because once the case is final over there, they'd all be moot, and you wouldn't need to apply  \n Well, that depends on who wins.\n You're right.\n I mean, if you lost in the other suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot. I mean, it   it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.\n I   I think that's right. I'd also like to address, just very briefly, the ASARCO question. The language that the Court used in there we don't necessarily think was loose or inappropriate, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason was the Court cites at that point an amicus brief by the United States and it cites a particular footnote. And what that footnote says is it's a recommendation that the mining company in that case could file a Federal lawsuit seeking a judgment that the invalidation of the statute was not necessary. But by challenging the invalidation itself, that   that looks more like a direct challenge to the State court judgment. It's not simply a relitigation. So that behind the Court's language there   and of course, it was really just addressing standing. It was not directly addressing Rooker-Feldman. But the U.S.'s suggestion in that case was a suit challenging the State court judgment, and in that situation, it looks more like appellate review, more likely to infringe upon Rooker Feldman-type interests. In the end, we believe that preclusion doctrines adequately cover all of this, that it is not true  \n Mr. Coleman, I don't mean to take your time, but in the ASARCO case, was the State court judgment final at the time in dispute?\n Your Honor, there's a question about that. I mean, the Court kept jurisdiction, but there was a determination that the statute was invalidate   was invalid and then a remand back to the district court for further proceedings.\n Because if the judgment were final, then that would fit right into your   your analysis, if the judgment of the State court were final.\n Yes, Your Honor, it would.\n Yes.\n In the   at the end of the day, we believe that this Court's preclusion jurisprudence is not riddled with vagaries, that it's not difficult to understand, and that it's certainly not more vague or difficult than the borrowing that they are attempting to do to bring existing preclusion doctrines into   in order to expand Rooker-Feldman. Preclusion is the answer in this case. We believe that the district court should be permitted to address that in the first instance, and we would ask the Court to reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Coleman. The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Judge Cudahy stated in his dissent in the Seventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report in this case should be required on both statutory and constitutional grounds. As Judge Cudahy put it, there is no item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's decision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.\n Mr. Shapiro, can this case, in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?\n Oh, yes, Your Honor. We believe it can.\n There also are due process allegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what the precise due process violation is that's alleged. But I would like you to address both and to tell us, first of all, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis from your perspective.\n The readiest ground for decision is the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is a good means to avoid a complex due process question. There are two statutes that are key here. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the public record statute. The public record statute says all reports of the Tax Court are public records, and we're talking about a report of the Tax Court in this case. The legislative history of that provision shows Congress had the broadest possible intent to make all practices in the Tax Court completely transparent. All steps in the adjudication were supposed to be  \n Well, would that include   if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law clerk memos to the judge?\n We   we don't take that position. It refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of a trial judge who heard the witnesses. The report is presumed correct under rule 183. It's the only independent evaluation of witness credibility  \n Now, why   why do you say that?\n   and the only judge  \n Would you elaborate for this reason? Because the briefs and you again today keep talking about that first document. You use the word report.\n Yes.\n Well, to me that's the whole conclusion of the case. I'm prepared to assume, at least for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the report they're talking about, you'd win. But that isn't what the Government says. The Government says that's a piece of paper, preliminary. We   like my draft. I write drafts all the time. So   so do trial judges. And he goes and brings the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down and talk about it. And they sit down and talk about it, and he changes his mind and writes a different document. And that different document, of course, is totally public. The whole opinion of the Tax Court. There is that document.\n There is only one rule 183 report. Under the rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares and submits to the chief judge at the completion of the trial, which contains his independent credibility findings.\n How do we know that? Now   now, what is the answer specifically in the statute? Let's call it document 1 and document 2. And it really didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1 continuously labeled with the word report when I thought that's the key question. Is it? Is it that report they're referring to? So now, go ahead.\n Under rule 183(b) there is a report denominated as such. There's no question here it was submitted to the court. If you look at page 114a of the Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge submitted a report, as required by rule 183(b). And this case was then referred to Judge Dawson. He had no involvement with the case until this report was given to him.\n Which  \n I'm sorry.\n Which   which brief  \n Oh. It's the petition for cert. The Kanter petition.\n At least  \n What   what page did you say?\n What   what page?\n 114a, 114a. And throughout  \n Mr. Shapiro, why don't you simply read the text of 183(b)  \n Yes.\n   which is in the Government's brief at 4a? It says, special trial judge's report. It is the only report to which the Tax Court rules refer.\n That's correct, Your Honor. And it's  \n And   and if in fact  \n   it is presumed correct.\n   you rely on the rule, do we even have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the statute? Can't we simply, from your position, rely on the rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?\n Absolutely. This is a report that must be submitted. It is presumed correct under this rule. It's an independent evaluation of credibility from the only judge who heard the witnesses, and of course, it's part of the record. And it doesn't  \n So you've really got three arguments. You've got the rule. You've got the statute, and you have due process.\n And it doesn't make the slightest difference that the superior judge caused the subordinate judge to say, I have changed my mind at a later stage in the proceeding, because it is the original report that is presumed correct under the rules.\n All right. Now, what   what was the page? Please. You're going quite   and I want to   because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in the Government's brief that you said yes  \n No, not the Government's brief. The Tax Court rules.\n That's   that's appendix 4a.\n 4a of the Government's brief.\n It's the rule.\n Yes, it's the rule itself, 183(b). And it makes it clear that there must be a report filed with the chief judge. The docket here says that that was done.\n Can you make the argument that   maybe you can't   that the special trial judge can go to the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief judge, and say, now, here's what   kind of what I'm thinking? It's not my report, but here's what I'm thinking. And then the   the Tax Court judge says, well, why don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z? He says, okay, and then he goes back. Can you make the argument that that first document is not the report?\n The first   there is only one  \n Well, I guess another way of saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before the report is submitted? I   I guess that's my question.\n The rules are silent on that, but Judge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the report is submitted. Then the case is assigned to Judge Dawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a presumptive correctness standard. So it would be surprising if there were consultation of that sort. But what we contend is if there is consultation behind the scenes about credibility determinations, then it is critically important that the report be submitted and made part of the record and not concealed, and that the deferential standard of review be  \n Would   would that problem be overcome if the special trial judge simply   if his   the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special tax judge?\n I suppose that's a possibility, but in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of the trial judge. Maybe in a   in the future the Tax Court would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate the Raddatz problem that they now have.\n In which case, they   they might well revise the language of their rule.\n Yes, they   they might, and  \n Which currently requires that the finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be correct.\n That's correct, and after all, we should remember that the Government was supposed to present clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this case, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on behind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what could be more important to the reviewing court than to know what had occurred at the first stage and the second stage here? If the trial judge found no underpayment and no fraud, which we have reason to believe he did   three Tax Court judges stated that to us   if that was   that was his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible, then an unexplained overturning of that credibility determination with no trace in the record would surely be a candidate for reversal on appeal.\n Let   let me ask this question, if I may. Suppose the   a special trial judge hears the witnesses, makes a report. It's assigned by the chief judge to a Tax Court judge, and the Tax Court judge looks it over it and says, you know, before I   before I really spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't explore these three problems. Would you please do it over again? Is he permitted to do that or is that a violation of the rule that he shall presume the report to be correct?\n Well, we haven't challenged the conversations as such. We think it is   it is suspect, however. Under Raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the witnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses, I don't agree or I think you may be wrong in your credibility determination, I'd like you to reconsider that, that's a serious Raddatz problem. And the only cure for that is to make the first report part of the record.\n I'm asking if it's a violation of   of the rule.\n The  \n Because the   the rule says a special report shall be presumed to be correct.\n Yes.\n And if there's this initial review, he says, you know, I think it's really pretty incomplete until you do X, Y, Z, please do it over again, is that a violation of the rule?\n Well, I think the rule is silent on that, but the spirit of the rule, frankly, is that the STJ does his job. He completes his report. He submits it, and the reviewing judge examines it under a presumed-correct standard in   in the same orderly fashion that ordinarily occurs when there is an initial judgment from a   from a trial judge about credibility with deferential review that comes later. But the rule doesn't tell us much about these consultations, and we do submit that if   if they do take place, as the Government suggests, there's importuning and changing of minds going on through consultations, do this on record. Turn square corners because it would be quite important to the appellate court to know if there was a good reason for the overturning of these credibility determinations. And we   we've seen that kind of review in the Stone case in the D.C. Circuit, which is very similar to this case. Factually the cases are quite similar. And the reviewing court, Judge Williams, found clear error based on what the rule 183 report stated about witness credibility. There was an elaborate explanation why particular witnesses were credible and incredible, and the court could use that to evaluate the judgment of the Tax Court.\n Of course, what you're asking us to do would   would just solve your problem in this case, and   and in the future, I suppose they could revise rule 183 as simply not to require a report. There   there's nothing in the statute that requires this report, is there?\n Well, that's true. They could cease using the STJ's, but  \n Well, they could   they could use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll consult with the   with the deciding judge.\n I   I suppose that could happen. If there is   if there is no report written, we couldn't contend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, and that   that might be. But it   there could be a Raddatz issue in that scenario that you present, Justice Scalia. If one judge heard the witnesses and the other judge didn't hear the witnesses and   and the   the superior judge  \n Well, they confer with each other. Maybe, maybe.\n But it   it would be   it would be quite strange to have credibility determinations made by a judge who had never heard from any of the witnesses.\n What happens in cases in agencies, you know, where   where   suppose the agency itself or a member thereof is going to make a decision, and there might be other members who would hear the witnesses. And I was thinking of that analogy. It's possible. It happens in the Federal Communications Commission where the staff, you know, consults back and forth in ratemaking cases.\n Oh, yes.\n It's hard to find precisely the analogy, but it seems likely.\n The   the closest analogy in this Court's decisions is the Morgan II decision.\n Yes, which gives and takes away.\n Now, Morgan II is really on point because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings, proposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but did give them to the decision-maker, the agency. And this Court held that was a violation of due process.\n You have to have an opportunity to refute the information that's going to  \n Absolutely.\n Yes.\n And   and every administrative body that we know of in the Federal courts and in the State system too   Chief Judge Vanderbilt pointed that out in the Mazza case. Every State in the Union requires disclosure of these administrative law decisions to the parties.\n If you analogize the STJ to the administrative ALJ. But you might also analogize him to a member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy, it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you look at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's going on.\n Yes. Well, we   we've avoided suggesting that any depositions should be taken of   of judicial personnel here. That's not our view. Our view is simply that the report that was prepared   it was prepared   should be made part of the record by virtue of two statutes. There is an appellate review statute, Justice O'Connor, that states quite expressly that Congress expected review to take place here just as it does in the district court, to the same degree, to the same extent, and in the same manner. And in the district court, if an adjunct judge makes a finding of fact, whether it's a master or a magistrate or bankruptcy judge, that is always disclosed to the parties.\n Mr. Shapiro, is there any evidence in this record that the special trial judge in fact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?\n We don't know what is contained in that first report. We have heard from three of the judges, including the chief judge of the STJ's, that   that what happened was that Judge Dawson rewrote the credibility findings. Now, we won't know until we see this. That could be wrong. But   but it should be part of the record for the court of appeals.\n Mr. Shapiro, on credibility, which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the case for it? Because credibility is more than just observing the witnesses' demeanor. I mean, Judge Dawson could have said, yes, they   these witnesses might have looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.\n Well, you'll see in perhaps a dozen situations, he says, I simply don't believe that witness, none of whom he heard. And this is a case where credibility was key. Was there a bribery scheme of the kind that the IRS claimed? Every witness who testified said no, it didn't exist. These are simple investments with the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet, the Government's theory was there is some nefarious bribery scheme that every witness denied. And there is no documentary evidence of that. The evidence of the proceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the result of their investing money in real estate deals. And so credibility was the key to this whole case. And the   the Government, I don't think, can be serious when it tells this Court that this first report is some confidential document, that it's privileged internal deliberative material. For 40 years, the   the Tax Court made these reports available to the public. It   they were routinely served on the parties. For 40 years there was no suggestion  \n Would   would you comment on that? I   I understood from the brief there was a suggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge volume of   of printed material that we're not troubled with now.\n Oh, yes. That's a post hoc rationale. There was no such explanation when this rule was changed, and there's not a bit of work or a bit of expense resulting from our position. We simply ask for a copy of a report that exists. They can serve it on us electronically. It won't cost them a cent. We're making a very modest request under these statutes and under the Due Process Clause. And there was no explanation  \n Well, now, wait. Under the Due Process Clause, I assume you would be asking for more than just access to the report. You   if   if you're really relying on Morgan II, he who hears must decide, I think you would be saying that after reading the report, you should have the opportunity to argue to the   to Dawson here, to   to the Tax Court judge that the report should not be adopted.\n Well, we defer to  \n Isn't that part of your due process case?\n It   it really is not. We're asking  \n You think it satisfies due process just to show you the report, and then  \n To give   and make it part of the appellate record. We're not asking for any remand to the Tax Court. If the Tax Court doesn't  \n Well, then   then you're not relying on Morgan II.\n Well, we   we just rely on that as an example of the need to disclose this at an appropriate juncture.\n There wasn't a need to disclose the point that Morgan II made. It was he who hears must decide.\n Well, in Morgan II, the   the point was that any   any proposed findings that are drafted up have to be shared with the parties. Now, there they had to be shared with the parties at the administrative level. We're not going that far. If the Tax Court tells us that they don't want to have that layer of review within the Tax Court, they don't want to receive our comments on the initial report, that's fine with us. We want it to be made part of the appellate record so that the judges who are interested in this and believe it will shed a strong light on the issue of clear and convincing evidence can have this be part of the record. And already the Fifth Circuit has overturned the finding of fraud in this very same case.\n Do   do I understand that you would be satisfied if the Court simply looked to   what is it   7482(a)(1), the appellate review section, which says that the Tax Court decisions shall be reviewed in the same manner and to the same extent as district court decisions? And that  \n Yes. We'd be satisfied because that is a sufficient basis to say the record has to include the rule 183 report. And it is not up to the trial court to tell the appellate court what's in the record on appeal. It's up to the appellate court to   to determine what goes into that   that record. This   the case in the Second Circuit on that is IBM v. United States where the Second Circuit analyzed rule 10(a) and said it is not the province of the trial court to dictate to the reviewing court what is in that record. And this Court in  \n And where is it? It's   it is specified someplace, but when you review a district court decision in   in a court of appeals, the   certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule that lists  \n Oh, yes. It's rule 10(a) and it's   it's very general. It says that all the original papers in the trial court come before the appellate court, and an original report is an original document submitted in the trial court. And this Court confronted that question in Universal Camera 50 years ago, and the Government made the same arguments then that it's making now and it lost 7 to 2 in that case. It   it said that the report  \n Institutional memory. Isn't that   that's a good institutional memory  \n It goes back. (Laughter.)\n The same argument was made that the report is an irrelevance. It's just an aid to the decision-maker, and the decision-maker can do what it wants and has ultimate judgmental power. So there's no need to include that report in the record, and no weight should be given to it. This Court said, we will not adopt an exclusionary rule for the administrative law judge's report. And this is an a fortiori case because this report is presumed correct. In Universal Camera, there was no presumption of correctness at all. So that   that case, you know, goes further than   than what the Court has to do here. And the Government's argument that   that somehow this is  \n That   that was decided under the APA, wasn't it? I mean, that was an APA case, which this isn't.\n Well, yes, that's true. But, you know, the Court reached out to the APA for guidance in construing the labor laws. The labor laws were silent on this issue, but under the APA, the Court said the general policy is to disclose these reports and we are going to say that that is applicable to the NLRB. Now, the Government says all of this changes the course because the judge changed his mind, but you know, there are so many opinions and orders and reports in the Federal judicial system where a mind is changed and an opinion is suppressed or   or vacated or replaced and that first opinion is still part of the record. It's a fallacy to say it's not part of the record just because it's been abandoned. For example, if I seek summary judgment in the district court and it's denied and then I ask for reconsideration and it's granted, the opinion has been abandoned, but it's still part of the record. And if I   if an appeal is taken, it's going to be exhibit A in any appeal, and it may result in a reversal. Same thing when a case goes en banc. The panel opinion is vacated, but then when   when cert is granted, the argument before this Court may convince this Court that the panel was right. Even though it's been abandoned, it's still very important. Or if a jury verdict is set aside   the   the district court says, judgment as a matter of law   on appeal, the jury   jury verdict may get sustained. So it's just a logical fallacy to say that because somebody has changed his mind, if that's what happened here, that   that the first report drops out of the record.\n Would the   the Tax Court rule   now, this 183(c)   says   it describes the special trial judge's report, which is submitted to the chief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a Tax Court judge, and then it says that   that the Tax Court judge may modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, or may reject it in whole or in part. Does the Tax Court ever modify a special trial judge's report? Does it ever reject it in whole or in part?\n Oh, yes, and   and the remarkable thing is that every time it does that, it recites, we hereby adopt the findings and opinions of the trial judge. Now, in the old days, that was not a problem.\n But that's one thing that they can do. They can adopt it, but my question is, do they always adopt and never use   never use the term modify or reject?\n Oh, no. They   they do modify and reject. It's just it's hard to determine, when they are doing that. In the old days  \n They   they never say so in their opinion.\n They don't  \n They always say that they adopt the trial judge's report. Don't they?\n Yes. That's entirely correct. And now, in the old days, before they amended the rule, you could compare the two and see what was changed, but now you can't. You can't tell what has been changed. And in this instance, we believe there's been a complete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate courts can't tell what's going on. Was there a reason for doing this? Was deference given? Was some other agenda at work in this decision? No one can tell because it is all off the record.\n What   what is   can I ask you a really esoteric administrative law question, which I have never been able to figure out? It's probably relevant, but I   this is an agency. That's what   my great tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no Tax Court. He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be known as the Tax Court. What he meant by that is it's not   it isn't the Tax Court, just known as. So   so this is an agency, an administrative agency. So I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA, when you look at the section, says this initial decision can be made by a 556-qualified person. Now, a 556-qualified person can include the agency itself or a member of the agency or an ALJ. Then when you to look at what happens in 557, after that presiding employee makes an initial decision, it says you have to give a chance to the party to respond to the initial decision, which you like, in the case where the presiding employee   presiding person is a subordinate employee. And so, that's what I was just checking here. And so   so what's supposed to happen where the presiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative decision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote, one or more members of the body which comprise the agency? I've never run into that before. Maybe you haven't. Maybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.\n Well, I   I haven't either. But the judge here certainly was subordinate and  \n He was a subordinate employee?\n Yes, he was.\n Rather than a member   is   is   if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. Then the case is easy I think.\n He   he is a subordinate because as the Government keeps telling us, the Tax Court judge is the only official spokesman for the court. They get to make the final judgment. And the Tax Court judge reviews what the STJ has done.\n These   these  \n But you're   you're not asserting that the APA governs this.\n Oh  \n No. I'm just looking  \n Isn't there an express exception for   for  \n Yes, and this a court. This is an Article I court, this Court has held. And Congress has created very specific appellate review procedures for this court.\n The   the special trial judge has no tenure, does she?\n That's correct. He   those judges could be terminated at will, including because there is not sufficient work for the judge. They can be terminated on that basis. And that, we think, colors the analysis here for the reasons Judge Cudahy gave. This is not an independent judge. When he is persuaded by his superior to change his mind, it's obvious that he   in our view, that he's going to be heavily influenced by that. It's a serious Raddatz problem. The only cure is to make this part of the record and to enforce the rule 183 presumption of correctness, which creates a clear error standard of review. I see my time has run out. May I reserve the rest for  \n Yes, you may, of course. Mr. Hungar.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The central flaw in petitioners' case is that both of the trial court judges responsible for evaluating the evidence in the record reached the same conclusion regarding all of the factual issues.\n Mr. Hungar, before you proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the Government is defending this practice because the Government, after all, is on the other side of every case. And aren't there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government's favor and then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were? I mean, I   I   the Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the special tax judge   special trial judge was?\n Justice Ginsburg, we do know what the report of the special trial judge was. It is in the record. Judge Couvillion's name is on his report.\n No, it is not the report. It is called an opinion. It isn't even called the report, and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report. Does anything else describe the report? And what is this report? There is a report. It is submitted to the chief judge. What would you call that?\n The report is the   contains the recommended findings of fact and opinion, analysis of the law and application of the law to the fact, of the special trial judge. The report is the findings of fact plus, quote, the opinion.\n Now, what is the 183(b) report?\n Well  \n There  \n The   under rule 183(b), the   the special trial judge submits his report to the chief judge. It is then referred to a Tax Court judge.\n So that report, the special trial judge's report, is a document prepared by the special trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.\n Correct. But the important thing to understand, Your Honor, is that nothing in the rule precludes, during the course of the deliberative process that then follows, the special trial judge from concluding that he has made a mistake, that he no longer agrees with the   the stated findings of fact in that   in that original report, from withdrawing and submitting a corrected report.\n But that's not the way the rule reads. The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that the court itself may accept, reject, or modify. It doesn't say anything about the special trial judge reconsidering and rewriting his report.\n It doesn't preclude it either, Your Honor. There's a longstanding practice  \n Yes, it does because it   it goes on to say that due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate and the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed to be correct. But if those findings of fact are simply the same findings of fact that he agrees with the rest of the   the panel on, it just makes no sense at all.\n The Tax Court judge cannot report in   in the opinion that is issued by the Tax Court, he cannot say I'm adopting the opinion and findings of the special trial judge if the   if the Tax Court judge does not agree with those and the   and the special trial judge adheres to his original decision. The only way it is possible for there to be a change is for the special trial judge himself to determine, in the exercise of his responsibility as a judicial officer, that he made a mistake.\n What report goes to the chief judge?\n Originally the original report goes to the chief judge.\n That's a report. Is that not a report?\n It is a report, Your Honor.\n Why doesn't that   why isn't that required to be   to be made public?\n Because if   because the   because the Tax Court has determined that it will not be made public, that it is part of internal deliberation.\n It's a report. The statute says that the reports have to be made public.\n No, Your Honor.\n That is a report.\n No, Your Honor.\n And it goes to the  \n No, Your Honor.\n No?\n With respect, the tax   the   the statute says a report of the Tax Court must be made public. A   a report  \n Well, but the rule   the rule says that the first report, the document 1, has to be given deference. Whether it's presumed to be correct.\n Well, Justice Kennedy, if I may, I'd like first to finish my response to Justice Scalia.\n Sure.\n The statutes   the   the disclosure requirement applies only to reports of the Tax Court. It is perfectly clear that a report, the original report, or any report of a special trial judge is not and cannot be the report of the Tax Court unless it is first adopted and approved by a Tax Court judge, and then goes through the next step of   of being submitted  \n Well, it's   it's very hard to understand how appellate review can function if that first report of the special trial judge is never disclosed. I just don't see how the appellate review can function properly.\n And how do we know that it was   that it was presumed to be correct under the rule?\n Yes. How does the appellate court know whether deference, as required by the rules, was given unless the appellate court can see it? It's such a strange procedure. Why, in answer to Justice Ginsburg, does the government take the view it does? Wouldn't you like to see it if it went against you?\n We submit, Your Honor, that there is no evidentiary or probative value in an initial conclusion that the   that the person who reached that conclusion has abandoned, has concluded was wrong. Special Trial Judge  \n Well, the rule  \n   Couvillion rejected  \n   the rule   the rule 183 does provide for a certain degree of deference to be given to those findings of the special trial judge.\n To the recommended findings of the special trial judge. And I submit that if the special trial judge has concluded that his initial recommendations were mistaken because, based upon further consideration as a judicial officer in the exercise of his obligations, he has realized he made a mistake, I submit it would be bizarre to require a Tax Court judge to give some sort of   of deference to  \n Mr. Hungar, do you  \n   abandoned findings.\n Do you see somewhat of a problem, that we are not dealing here with the relationship between peers? Judge Dawson is appointed, what, for a 15-year term. The special trial judge is appointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax Court's grace. And if you have compared in your brief that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, I think it's worlds different.\n Justice Ginsburg, Judge Dawson actually is a senior judge who was recalled. So he doesn't have the 15-year term protection. But it's true that special trial judges are   are appointed by the chief judge, not by the Tax Court judges, but by the chief judge, so that Judge Dawson wasn't, in a sense, his   his appointing, employing official. But more to the point, special  \n He has had a special   a   a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the court were appointed.\n Well, Judge Couvillion has been a special trial judge, I think, for nearly 20 years. But the point is special trial judges are bound by the code of conduct. The Tax Court has adopted for both Tax Court judges and special trial judges the same code of conduct that applies to Federal judges under Article III, which  \n It seems to me  \n   obligates independent decision-making.\n It seems to me that it's very much like, if you have to compare it with something, the relationship between a magistrate and a Federal district court judge. The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a report, findings, and a recommendation. What's the difference between those two?\n Well, one difference is that the district court judges, as I understand it, appoint the magistrate, not the chief judge. But a more significant difference is that the statute and rules applicable to magistrates require disclosure of their reports and do not treat them as part of the internal deliberative process. The Tax Court has determined that it is inefficient to have disclosure of the original report, then have exceptions and have that whole process followed that they used to follow. They have determined that they will treat the Tax Court   excuse me   the special trial judge's report  \n So where does it say that? Where does it say that?\n They're not requiring the   this case doesn't involve the question of whether they can make objections to the finding in   in the special report. It's just whether it's disclosed.\n Yes, Your Honor. But the   but the Tax Court has determined not to disclose it.\n No, I understand. But your argument about how it would make the proceeding more cumbersome, it seems to me, is   is misplaced.\n Well, it certainly would be more cumbersome if they followed the procedure that they used to follow, which we submit, although the record is   they did not specifically state  \n But they're not asking for that. Am   am I wrong on  \n Yes, that's true, Your Honor. What they're asking for here, what they say they want is merely disclosure of the original report.\n And it's a particularly strong argument in a case   in several of the issues. I remember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility of oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the   the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility on one issue, if I remember correctly. And it seems to me that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility determinations were made by the person who heard the witnesses.\n But the person who heard the witnesses is Special Trial Judge Couvillion.\n Has been convinced that he was wrong.\n Yes.\n And the question is, well, what was his   what was the basis for his original position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid argument to make on appeal?\n Under that rationale, Justice Stevens, every time a district court judge changes his mind, after giving further thought to a case  \n No, no, no.\n   before he issues his final opinion  \n Only if he is required by a rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed report to someone else.\n Well, again, the   the rule does not preclude the practice. It is a common practice  \n It doesn't forbid it. You're right. It doesn't forbid it in so many words. But I just wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know what the basis for decision was and who thought what about the witnesses and so forth?\n Absolutely, Your Honor. If the   in a   when a   when a court has a collegial deliberative process involving more than one person that is involved in the decision-making   certainly this is an unusual process in that   and there is no identical analog, but we see no due process problem.\n No. But I don't see what is consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as producing the report and the presumption of correctness in the rule. The rule presumes that some original document, which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a presumption of correctness, and I don't see the consistency between provisionality and deliberate character on the one hand and presumption on the other.\n If I may, Your Honor, the rule does not state that the, quote, original report shall receive a presumption of correctness. It doesn't even say that   that any report shall receive a presumption of correctness. It says the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge.\n And aren't those findings of fact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief judge in the report that is made to the chief judge before it is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?\n Not if   not if the tax   if the special trial judge has abandoned those recommendations, withdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.\n But he hasn't abandoned them at the point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if that's what this is referring to, then the presumption of the   of   of correctness necessarily has to apply to whatever the document is that's delivered to the chief judge.\n Well, it applies to the report, but I submit that if the special trial judge withdraws in order to correct an error in the report, what he submits as the corrected report is then the, quote, report.\n You're   you're  \n Why isn't that explained in the rules, if that's the process?\n   have a condition subsequent. It seems to me that you're saying, Mr. Hungar, that the last sentence of 183 is unenforceable.\n The   the credibility   the due regard and presumption of  \n The presumption.\n Well, it's important to understand also that, in fact, it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. This rule must be construed to be consistent with the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code makes very clear, and this Court held in Freytag, that the Tax Court judge, not the special trial judge, is the decision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds of cases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute. This Court so held in Freytag and the   and the statute makes that very clear. So it would violate the statute to construe this, as petitioners do, to require some sort of deferential clear error review.\n So you're saying the rule itself in that respect is invalid?\n If construed as petitioners would have it, yes.\n Well, how else could you possibly construe it? There's no presumption operating at all on your reading.\n In the tax context, Your Honor, the   there is a presumption of correctness that attaches to assessments and deficiency notices issued by  \n No, but you're saying there is   there is no presumption of correctness that can operate with respect to the report that goes first to the chief judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge. And therefore, I think the implication of what you're saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.\n Your Honor, presumption of correctness does not necessarily equate with clear error, deferential review. That's my point.\n I'm   I'm not even getting to whatever the standard of review may be. I presume the word presumption means something other than it's there unless you want to change it later after the person who employs you objects to it. It's got to mean something more than that.\n What the presumption of correctness means in the tax context, with respect to deficiency determinations and the like, is that the burden of going forward is on the party seeking to change what   what   the determination that is presumed correct.\n But there's no party who is seeking to change at this point because the parties don't know what's in it. They're not going forward. This is, as you point out, an internal process that is going on here. So that definition can't apply.\n No, Your Honor. If   there   there are two processes that go on. The Tax Court judge, quite appropriately, we   we assume and have   have no reason to disagree, confers with, discusses with the special trial judge. If   if in the course of that discussion, one or both of them come to the conclusion that something is wrong in the original report and if the special trial judge agrees, the special trial judge has the option of withdrawing his original report, submitting a corrected report, and having the presumption of correctness, whatever it means, apply to his corrected report. If   if  \n In   in that discussion, does the Tax Court judge have to give great weight to the findings of fact of the   of the special judge?\n No, Your Honor, not great weight because, again, that would violate the statute.\n Any weight?\n He is to give due   the due regard provision we think is essentially precatory, as the   as the Seventh Circuit said. It reminds the   the Tax Court judge that he should not lightly set aside the credibility determinations. But again, that's not what happened here.\n So I   I think your   I think your answer then is not that this is invalid. It is simply unenforceable. It is precatory language, looks okay, but there's no way to police it.\n It's certainly not enforceable in an appellate court. That's correct.\n Judicially it cannot be enforced.\n That's correct, because otherwise it would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningful limitation. But again, it's important to understand here the Tax Court judge did not exercise his authority in this case to reverse or set aside the special trial judge's findings. He could have done so  \n Do they   do they ever? I mean, this   this says, this decision   it's labeled   the   the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the special trial judge. Are there Tax Court cases where the Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the decision of the special trial judge or the court rejects, in whole or in part, the report of the special trial judge?\n We cite  \n Do Tax Court opinions come out that way?\n We cite in footnote 4 a small number of cases from prior to the last rule change in which that occurred. In addition, there are at least a couple of cases since the rule change in which the Tax Court judge rejected parts of the opinion, but not the findings. We're not aware of any cases in which the Tax Court judge has rejected the findings, but there are other cases   Little against Commissioner, 103 T.C. 285; Walker against Commissioner, 101 T.C. 537   in which the Tax Court judge expressed a disagreement with a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge and then proceeded to decide the case in the manner he or she thought  \n Because if one were just to rule this   read this rule straight: first, the report that goes to the chief judge, and then it says that the Tax Court judge may modify it, reject it in whole   adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part. You would expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in combination with the special trial judge or without, would say, action on the report   action on the report, which is the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or it is rejected or it is rejected in part. I mean  \n Well, again, that assumes that the   that the   the rule compels the interpretation that the special trial judge is prohibited from withdrawing, correcting, and resubmitting his report. I submit it does not compel that interpretation, and the Tax Court  \n The rule   the rule doesn't say anything about this consultation that you've described. And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why isn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it instead of being deceived by reading here is the special trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?\n Well, I don't think it   I mean, I don't think it's   it's deceitful, the   the possibility that a court  \n Misleading. Because when I just read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court judge, and that judge does something with it, and that something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject in whole or in part.\n Your Honor, when the Tax Court adopted its present procedures in 1984, it   it certainly did not do so in as artful a manner as it could have. But the question is whether it violates the statute or due process for it to do what it has done. Let me just   we've been spending most of our time talking about this issue of whether the Tax Court   the special trial judge is permitted to change his report under rule 183. That's not even one of the questions in the questions presented. The only rule 183 question in the questions presented is whether the rule requires clear error review. We submit the answer to that is no because it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. So this   this question about whether the report permits   whether the rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one of the questions presented. The courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the premise that it was permissible for the Tax Court judge and the trial   the special trial judge to engage in the deliberative process and for the special trial judge to revise his findings as he did  \n I don't think there's any   any question they can change the report, but the one   the one   I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of information. The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned may direct the filing of additional briefs to receive further evidence and oral argument. Does it ever happen that before the judge to whom it's assigned decides whether or not to go along with the recommended findings, that he will direct oral argument? Does that ever happen?\n I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor. I'm not aware of that, but  \n Because if he did, it would seem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties what the report they're arguing about would say.\n Again, I   this is a holdover from the prior version of the rule in which the exceptions process was followed, and again, it may be that had the Tax Court given it further consideration, they might have viewed that unnecessary. But we're not aware of that happening.\n But it certainly seems to contemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case is assigned about whether or not to accept the report and deliberation which might be informed from input   input from the parties. That's a fair reading of the rule, I think.\n If  \n Maybe it's not practiced.\n   if the Tax Court judge so determines, yes. The rule certainly allows that, but it doesn't obviously require that.\n And if he did then ask for further briefings, do you think that there would then have been a requirement to disclose the report?\n Well, presumably it would be a waste of everyone's time unless he   I don't know that he would have to disclose the report, but he would need to direct their attention to the issue he would like them to brief.\n It seems to me that the author of this subsection (c) must have contemplated the possibility of disclosure of the report.\n Well, again, Your Honor, this language was adopted at a time when they followed the exception  \n When they followed a different procedure, and the question is to how much   how much did they intend the   to change that prior procedure.\n Well, we know that the Tax Court has interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice it followed here because it said so. And it would be quite extraordinary, we submit, for this Court to reverse the Tax Court, which is surely entitled to considerable deference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all, the Tax Court has exclusive statutory authority to promulgate its own rules, and particularly with respect to this issue about whether the special trial judge can change his report, since that was not even one of the questions presented. If I may turn to   back to the statutory question. Section 7461 requires disclosure of reports of the Tax Court. The special trial judge report is not the report of the Tax Court. Indeed, even a Tax Court judge's opinion and report does not become the report of the Tax Court.\n Does the statute you just quoted prohibit the disclosure of other reports if we call this first draft something other than a report?\n The statute doesn't  \n In other words, would   would the rule go further than the statute?\n The statute does not prohibit the disclosure of other reports, but the rule clearly does not require the disclosure of reports. The Tax Court in 1984 amended the rule to make perfectly clear that   that initial reports of special trial judges are not to be disclosed. The Tax Court said in its orders in this case the reason for that is that those are now internal deliberative processes. The Tax Court has made clear that its rules permit exactly what it's doing here.\n Mr. Hungar, you started to say that   that even the opinion of a   of a Tax Court judge is not a report of the Tax Court.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n How does that work?\n Page 2a of the appendix to the gray brief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) provides that the report of the division   and the Tax Court is now and has for many years been divided into one-judge divisions. They used to sit en banc or  \n I was   I was going to ask you what   what 7461 referred to when it says the Tax Court and its divisions.\n Yes.\n It also is referred to there.\n For a brief period of time, they sat in   in panels.\n I see.\n But they   the   the press of work force them to   to divide into one-judge divisions.\n So it's a single judge is a division of the Tax Court.\n Yes, that's correct.\n And the publicity of proceedings does say   it does say that all reports of the Tax Court  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n And all evidence received by the Tax Court and its divisions, meaning its single judges. Well, what happens with   with a single judge's opinion?\n He   he prepares it and submits it to the chief judge under rule   under statute   under the statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the division shall become the report of the Tax Court within 30 days after such report by the division, unless the chief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court. So   so even a Tax Court judge's opinion is not the report of the Tax Court. Surely the report of the special trial judge is not either.\n It's like an en banc. I   I have written decisions for a panel in my years on the court of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my opinion gets vacated. It's no longer counts for anything. And isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is? They have the  \n No, Your Honor. The   the opinion is not made public. In fact, the statute precludes it from being made   made a part of the record. The last sentence of that same section 7460(b) at the top of page 3a, it says the report of a division shall not be a part of the record in any case in which the chief judge directs that such report shall be reviewed by the Tax Court. And that's a very important point. Congress has mandated by statute essentially the same procedure that the Tax Court follows here.\n Oh, no. No, no, no. How often, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's initial position was?\n The   the Tax Court judge certainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special trial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation under the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a   on a report if he doesn't agree with it. If he doesn't agree with the Tax Court judge's view, he has the obligation, the ethical obligation   and we presume he follows it   to say I don't agree. This is my report. If you  \n Then he   then he can publish his   he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax Court judge can?\n No, but he can preclude the Tax Court judge from doing what the Tax Court judge did in this case, which is simply adopting his report. If the   if the special trial judge refuses to change his report  \n But then we still won't know what his report is. Yes, he can say, I won't sign this. Tax Court says, fine. This rule says I can reject your findings in whole or in part. I don't need your name on this decision of the Tax Court.\n Justice Ginsburg, if   if that were the case here, obviously our arguments would be more difficult. But that is not what happened here. If   if  \n I'm asking you just as the   the judge who disagrees with the   the full court can publish his dissent, can the special trial judge who disagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?\n In the   the one case involving a change in the opinion, where the Tax Court judge said, I don't adopt a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge, there was no published opinion of the special trial judge. So I don't believe there's a procedure for the dissent. But the point is the court of appeals  \n Has there ever been? Has there ever been?\n A published dissent by a special trial judge? Not that I'm aware of. But the point is the court of  \n And how   how often does the   is there a dissent when there's   when there's a full court review decision?\n Well, there's often a dissent. It's   it's hard to know from the standpoint of a researcher when   when it is that the judge who heard the evidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting, unless they happen to say it in their opinion, because again, there's no original opinion issued by the Tax Court judge who first heard the case. That's kept confidential by statute, which again is an important point. Congress has mandated confidentiality of the initial reports prepared even by Tax Court judges, and it has given the Tax Court plenary authority to promulgate rules governing special trial judges. It is hardly surprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or Due Process Clause, for the Tax Court to follow a similar process for special trial judges.\n Except that the   the relationship between the   the one judge and the full Tax Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the same boat with respect to what they know about or can know about law and what they can know about the evidence and the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between the special trial judge and the judge to whom it is assigned is   is quite different because only one of them has heard evidence and only one of them is the source of conclusion about fact.\n No, Your Honor. It's identical. The   the full Tax Court  \n It certainly is not identical in   in the sense that the   the Tax Court judge then goes and listens to evidence. He doesn't. That's the whole point.\n Well, neither does the full Tax Court when it  \n Neither does the full Tax Court, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one judge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the same boat. They have access to the same material. Their limits are exactly the same in each case. That is not true in the relationship between the single Tax Court judge and the special Tax Court judge. The special Tax Court judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can find facts based upon the evidence that he heard.\n No, Your Honor. The   the tax   the full Tax Court doesn't go back and   and hold a new trial, just like the individual Tax Court judges  \n I   I am quite aware of that. That's not   that's not the point. I'm   I'm saying that you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and full Tax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize the relationship between one judge and a trial master. They are in different positions. They are not in parallel positions.\n Well, then if   if I understand the point you're making, it's a point of the   the   it's the hierarchy issue, if that's   if that's the point you're making.\n It's the knowledge issue. The special Tax Court judge heard somebody.\n So did the Tax Court judge  \n Nobody on the Tax Court did.\n No, Your Honor. That's incorrect.\n In other words, they're   they're sitting hearing witnesses? They are   they are redoing the trial? Surely not.\n Your Honor, in a review   if a Tax Court judge   most Tax Court cases are tried by Tax Court judges. Tax Court judges are trial judges, and if a Tax Court judge tries a case  \n But we are talking about situations in which the trial judge is the special judge.\n Well, I'm talking about the full Tax Court, Your Honor. If the full Tax Court reviews an individual Tax Court judge's decision, the Tax Court judge has presided over the trial, heard the evidence, just like the special trial judge here, and then the full Tax Court judge reviews it. That's exactly what happened in the Estate of Varian case, which is in our briefs, out of the Ninth Circuit. The parties complained that they wanted access to the original judge's report because he had been reversed   been reversed by the full court after trial on an   on an evidentiary issue, and the Ninth Circuit said no.\n Mr. Hungar, I think we understand your answer.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Shapiro, you have about 4 minutes left.\n The question came up whether rule 183 forbids disclosure of this report. The answer is it does not forbid disclosure of the report. It is silent on the point. But the press release the Tax Court issued in 1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said that this simply meant that it would not automatically be disclosed.\n Why does 7461 require its   its disclosure? Because it does say that the   it's only the decision of the Tax Court.\n Well  \n That reports of the Tax Court that have to be disclosed.\n Our view is that of   of the Tax Court means any report emanating from the Tax Court. That's the literal meaning of that language. It doesn't mean final.\n Well, that   that would mean that   that you would have to make public the   the reports of a regular Tax Court judge in cases that then go on to the full court. And that's not done, is it?\n There's an exception for the en banc situation because legal issues are addressed en banc, not the factual issues. And there's an opportunity to dissent.\n Well, but it doesn't matter. It would still be a report of the Tax Court if you don't take that language literally. If you say any report coming out of the institution is a report of the Tax Court, you would have to make public the reports of the individual Tax Court judges, which is not done.\n Oh, we say there's a special statute dealing with the en banc situation that   that governs in that situation. And that the publicity  \n Why is that? What   what statute is that?\n That   that's the en banc provision that counsel referred to that said that when the case is heard en banc, the trial   the   the single judge's report is not made part of the record. Congress' assumption there was that there would be a new   new report issued. People would be able to dissent if they disagreed. And this process focuses on legal issues. There is no presumption of correctness.\n That's not a   that's not a de novo   they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc Tax Court, can they not? That's a de novo hearing.\n Yes, but it addresses legal issues. It's not a device to second guess factual determinations, and there's a special statute that deals with that, which does not apply to this STJ situation, where there's a presumption of correctness applicable to what the trial judge does. And there is the general disclosure statute that applies there.\n I don't know if I'm getting   so that's his basic point. The rule doesn't require the disclosure because they've interpreted it differently within their   within their discretion. Statute doesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require it. We have to go to the Constitution, I don't see exactly the implications. So I'm nervous. And now, the reports   he says, go read 7460(b). That's what they're talking about. And then   and again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read it more broadly than that. And what about all evidence received by the Tax Court, including a transcript. Of course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript. And   and so maybe that word evidence can be read more broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript of the stenographic report.\n I think you're right, and  \n You think I'm right just suddenly for the for the first time? You have thought of this?\n Well, I   I think that the intent of this provision   and I know Your Honor consults the legislative history. The intent was to make all of the steps in the adjudicative process transparent, including the evidence, including the   the stenographer's report, and all reports from the Tax Court.\n There's   there's a very careful use of language. It says all reports of the Tax Court and all evidence received by the Tax Court and its divisions. So it's only the evidence that   that's received by the individual judges has to be made public, not the reports.\n Well, we believe that the word all is a broad, generic inclusive term that should be applied, as Judge Cudahy stated, to an STJ report that actually has to be submitted to the chief judge and that has legal effect. It's not just a casual document like a law clerk memorandum. It has legally operative effect. Congress' purpose here was very broad, to have transparency, applicable to all the steps along the way in the Tax Court. It was quite clear on that, that there are arbitrary actions at each step of the way. If you look at the Senate report and Congressman LaGuardia's statements, they said secrecy is a vicious practice in this context, and it   it should be avoided.\n But we   we don't have to get into any of that if we accept your argument about 7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district court.\n Absolutely, Your Honor. There   there are three separate bases for ruling in our favor. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the disclosure statute. The third is due process. And due process should inform the construction of these statutes. This Court tries to avoid serious due process issues through its interpretation of legislation. Judge Cudahy suggested that was the right way to decide this case and we agree that it is. We thank the Court.\n Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Prisoners typically want two things: first, to improve their conditions while in prison; and second, to get out of prison as quickly as possible. Respondents' claims here are not conditions claims. They do not seek a larger cell or better food while in prison. Rather, their claims are about getting out of prison. Traditional understandings of habeas would suggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in section 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms that this common sense answer is also the correct answer. In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which independently prevent respondents from using section 1983 to pursue their claims here. First, Heck establishes that civil actions under section 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State criminal judgments. Before a prisoner can advance a claim under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it has been favorably terminated. And Edwards v. Balisok confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal judgments for this purpose.\n Well, it isn't just duration of   of confinement. I mean, in   in Balisok, what you had was a determination that the confinement would be definitely less as a result of the   the good time scheme. The   the gut notion behind Balisok was that what you were attacking would imply that the sentence itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on. We don't have that here. What we have here is a scheme that makes a   a sentence that is imposed a more definite sentence. We know where in the range it's going to be reconsidered. And however that may be classified, it's not simply a Balisok situation.\n It's arguably different than the good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as   as Your Honor notes. However, I   I would suggest that even with respect to good-time credits, often under many State systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially   and in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on the  \n Right, but that had  \n   of the sentence.\n   that had nothing to do with the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that correct?\n Your Honor, the   the Court   that's   that's correct, yes. And I guess what I'd   I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court, though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence; that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement, then that isn't a   or that isn't a claim that should be brought in 1983.\n No   no question. But the durational consequence in those cases was a definite consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in   in the second example. Here, there   there is no such clear consequence. Here, the consequence is that there will simply be a period of time before a sentence already imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it will be shortened or allowed to run. And that's different.\n I'm not sure it is, Your Honor. Both of them are going to have definite durational consequences for confinement.\n No   no question about that. At   at the level of whether there is a durational consequence, they   they both have it. I   I grant you that.\n And, Your Honor, as far back as Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration go to the very heart of habeas corpus. That's  \n The duration of   of the sentence. And here, there's no implication at all that this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't   the determination of parole eligibility or parole suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in any way, shape, or manner. Does it?\n Well, a decision from a Federal court   and I guess   I think the answer to Your   Your Honor's question is yes, it does. And the reason I say that is I think we need to look to the consequences of the Federal court decision that would follow from the claims that   that the plaintiffs   or I'm sorry   the prisoners here are advancing. The State of Ohio has made individualized decisions with respect to each of these respondents that they should not again be considered for release from prison until 2005. The request   the relief that they're requesting and the claims that they're bringing, if successful, would result in the Federal court undermining that State decision with regard to the length that they should be incarcerated. It goes directly to the   the  \n It doesn't   it doesn't shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated. There   there is no certainty that   that if they win this action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser period, is there?\n Absolutely no certainty of that, Your Honor. But there is certainty  \n And   and there was in the other cases, wasn't there? In Balisok.\n Well, Your Honor, I don't think so. I mean, prisoners could be released in the State of Washington before the terminus of their sentence. They might not   it isn't as though they had to serve all the way till the end, less whatever good-time credits they had. They could easily be  \n Well, but  \n   released prior to that time.\n Oh, indeed, but the   but   but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be   be released earlier. They might have been released even earlier still, but their entitlement to be released earlier was a consequence, wasn't it?\n It was, Your Honor.\n And there is no entitlement to be released earlier as a consequence of this.\n We  \n You just get another hearing and maybe you will, maybe you won't.\n That's correct. You'll   you'll just get another hearing. But an important note on that: you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing sooner than the State has decided that you should get a hearing.\n Well, that's true. So it makes it possible that you'll get released earlier, but   but there's no assurance you'll   really, the crucial question for me, I think, is whether   whether this could have been brought as a habeas action. Could this have been brought as a habeas action?\n Yes, Your Honor, it could have been brought as a habeas action. If you look at the nature of their complaints, they're   they're clearly in custody. Habeas would require custody and violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n But they're just asking for a new hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release. What's your closest case that   that would allow a habeas action which does not seek an earlier release but just   just a hearing?\n I think probably the Garlotte case, Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge where the only result was going to be to advance the date of eligibility for release from prison incarceration.\n No. But it   No, go on.\n But it   it doesn't advance the date of eligibility. It advances the date at which the parole board will take another look. The only eligibility is an eligibility to take   to have another look taken and not an eligibility for release.\n That's true, Your Honor, but these   under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility means the first possible release date. But these prisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of it's not going to happen for them unless and until the next release hearing.\n But if they are subject to another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for release. And I think that's the point that we're getting   let me   let me ask a   a sort of complementary question. Is there any reason that these  \n Is this with an I or an E?\n I was hoping for an I, yes.\n With an I or an E?\n With an E. With an E. But if   if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I, that's perfectly okay too. (Laughter.)\n I'll   I'll wait and see what the question is  \n Let's see what it is. The   the question is, could these claims not have been brought in advance of any application to these particular prisoners of the revised   whatever they were   the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas would   would not have been a possible remedy. Is   is   am I correct on those two points?\n The State concedes that if they had brought this case before a parole hearing at which the guidelines were applied, that it would be a different case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that   in that situation.\n Here's   here's the difficulty that I   that I have. When I read your brief, I thought, well, he must be right because this is really about custody. It's really about custody. They want to get out eventually. But then when I   I   when I went back to Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's going to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas? Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's clear that habeas should have been brought. And so if he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't got to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go to habeas unless you had to, unless you had   unless it was necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's why that language is there. Now, I got that far. Then I said, oh, I see what you do. We should have one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But there's no reason not to have a different rule when you have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could follow your rule. But the next thing I come across is a statement that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or declaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we write that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this trouble. But the   the   well, because we didn't want to make it too complicated and   and not have all the questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it really, et cetera. Okay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well, I'm going to have to change something for you to win. Either I have to change the thing that says the damages should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change something else somewhere along the line, the word necessary. I don't want to change the word necessary. Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really? Because all that's important here is people know which way they should go. Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking give him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from Balisok. Why not?\n Well, Your Honor, there would be some real consequences that would follow from that.\n That's what I thought.\n The reason that it's important that these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant with habeas. Parole claims like those advanced here are often, if not always, intricately bound up with State law issues, and the State law is often going to provide much more meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that the prisoners advance.\n Doesn't the Prison Litigation Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?\n Yes, but as Your Honor is aware, that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by habeas. Moreover, it's telling  \n Is   may   may I just follow up on that question? At the administrative level, cannot these State law policies perfectly well be taken into consideration? In other words, your argument was these things are bound up with State law issues and the best place to have them resolved is   is in a State forum. They can be resolved in a State administrative forum, can't they?\n They could, Your Honor, but I   I think the types of legal determinations with respect to legal entitlements and also the court   we would assume a State court would also consider Federal claims that might be made by the prisoners when they bring their State court claim. Those types of legal claims are better resolved by State courts. They have the expertise to make the   the determination. And in fact, in Ohio  \n Well, couldn't one say the same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 1983 action? The States know better about how their prisons are operating and what changes would have to be made. So I   I think that you   you may be right that the State knows more about how its parole system operates, but so does it know more about how its prison system operates. And that doesn't   that's not what determines whether you have 1983 or habeas.\n Well, but Congress, with respect to conditions claims   and if you look at the language of the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at 42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without administrative exhaustion. So even Congress, in thinking about the PLRA and in thinking about requiring administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really about conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about   it never has been about   release. Habeas has traditionally been the relief that people   or the cause of action that people bring when what they're interested in is relief   or release from prison. And these claims, no one can dispute, are release-driven claims. They may not ultimately be successful in securing release, but the prisoners here  \n Well, no, I've got that part. But the   and   and you're right about that part. But that   you know, that doesn't get over the   the hump here I think because of the   what we've written. The   I mean, where I'm coming out now, what you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be exhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we say that habeas doesn't   that 1983 applies here I think probably   I can't guarantee it   but those where prison conditions would then cover it, and then there would be exhaustion, and there   where it doesn't seem to make difference there. And now I'm back to asking the other half of this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your point, I think you're right. Now, what   what is your recommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do? Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the injunctive/declaratory relief cases?\n I don't think you need to do either, Your Honor. I think if we go back to Heck and look at the language there that talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something  \n Oh, well.\n   respondents concede in their brief, the only question then is does a parole decision count as a, quote, criminal  \n All right. No, but then what you're doing is taking the first half because what you're reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever those words were in Balisok that we were just talking about, as your case satisfying that condition. And if your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case where a person wants to bring a damage action because of illegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I mean, because all   I mean   and then we've swept   then we've done   we've really moved Balisok from what it was trying to do.\n I don't think that's necessarily right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence at the trial   I don't know that that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from that trial.\n Why is he bringing his damage action? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did at that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt me because I went right to prison.\n Right, Your Honor, and that   that's absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in bringing their claim. It turns on the necessary implication of success on that claim, and that's a   a distinction that the Court made both in Heck and in Balisok. They looked to what's the necessary implication. So we look to the claims here, not why they brought them, but what are the claims. And the claims here, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are the ex post facto claims. If the   if they have success on their ex post facto claims   and we don't believe their claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on those claims, there's no way the State's decision can stand. They are entitled to a new hearing at which they would again be considered for parole  \n Yes, but does that mean the   the judgment   the order denying release on parole is invalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you   we're not going to release you. Secondly, your next hearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as you challenge the date of the hearing   the date of the next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity of the entire order denying parole?\n We   we concede that if there's an ex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled to a new parole hearing. And I guess the  \n But they're not entitled to parole.\n Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely.\n So that it doesn't totally invalidate the order that is at issue.\n Well, the way that   that I've been thinking about it is if you put the State parole decision up on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the wall, one of them has to come down. The Federal decision trumps the State decision. It can  \n Well, it doesn't entirely come down. It just   half of it comes down.\n No. The whole thing comes down, Your Honor. They're entitled both to an immediate new release hearing and  \n But not for release.\n   if they're successful on their claims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings in the future. So the decision, the State's  \n But   but isn't it true that one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had refused to grant them parole?\n Absolutely.\n And that remains.\n It doesn't, Your Honor. They have to decide that again. That   that order is void ab initio. It's as though it were never entered. They have to make a new decision about whether or not this person should   should have parole and that they cannot in any way   the State cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached on that issue.\n I thought the only relief they were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.\n No, they   Dotson's complaint, I believe at page 20 of the joint appendix   he wants to, quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed his crimes. They want an  \n But aren't   aren't those claims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it, he has had another parole hearing. So he's   with the hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or   or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that this case now reduces to a clean question about the retroactive application of the new guidelines.\n Well, it isn't a clean question, Your Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges infected his first hearing was present at his second hearing. If   if you look at the materials that they added to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have the new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 2002 parole decision was predicated on exactly the same guidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, in fact, if anything, it's made his situation worse because a Federal decision on his claims now would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his previous hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 2002 hearing was a release hearing. Unlike the halfway review that occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release hearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both that he should not get parole then and that he should not again be considered for parole until 2005.\n Was there   maybe I'm wrong about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to the 2002 hearing.\n But what Heck makes clear is it doesn't matter what you say you're challenging. What we need to look to is what's the necessary implication of securing success on your claims in Federal court for a State decision. Here, the necessary implication, if they're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going to be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 1999 decision  \n Why can't it simply be that prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing anything that's happened in the past?\n I think for the same reason that in Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective order that said   said something like the method you have for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that method for selecting decision-makers. Saying that you have to change it on a going-forward basis would mean, necessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and deceit by the decision-maker that would mean that  \n I think twice you started something and our questions impeded you. But I think you were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal sentence, and so you   you were saying just as the   the Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board determination. And   and I thought that the comparison between a   a sentence   a criminal conviction and sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination   you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.\n Not exactly on the same plane, Your Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments that are protected for purposes of   of the Heck doctrine. And in Greenholtz, this Court  \n But   but the   the generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect to conditions of confinement, is a   is a higher level of generality than anything that Balisok decided. In Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the good time would give, and   and that is a much more specific   I mean, that literally affects an entitlement to be released. It is not merely a decision with respect to length of confinement.\n Well, Your Honor, if this turns on whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you that it seems good-time credits might be different from an entitlement sense than parole. But   but all the way back, in tracing the cases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about duration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue that the decision here is going to have dramatic consequences for the duration of these prisoners' confinement.\n We   we don't know what consequence it will have for the duration of his confinement. All we know is that it will have a consequence in determining the date at which the next look will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then is in a condition to be released. That's all we can tell.\n That's correct, Your Honor, but they're   they're pressing ex post facto claims. And as this point   Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they can maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency of parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a definite impact on the quantum of punishment that they receive as a result of that change. So if they're going to be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're going to have to show an impact on the duration of their confinement. Either they have no ex post facto claim because there's no durational impact on their  \n Okay. But you're   you're assuming   your argument now is assuming that they are going to be successful on this element, that you say they've got to satisfy later.\n Right, but that's the Heck  \n And   and whether they are or not has nothing to do with   with Balisok and Heck.\n I   I disagree, Your Honor, because in Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens if they're successful on their claims. So I'm   we're   the State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they're going to be successful on these claims. We don't agree it's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they're going to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it means they're going to have to show, have to demonstrate a durational impact on their sentence.\n Sure. It also   it also means that if   if   assuming your argument is sound, if you lose this case, you win the war. (Laughter.)\n At   at some level, I think there's an   an inherent and fundamental tension in their position, and   and the coin could flipped and conversely there's that same tension in ours.\n Are   are you sure that that's what they have to prove, that   a durational impact? Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of an opportunity to have the sentence shorter? Wouldn't   wouldn't it   assuming there was an ex post facto violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?\n But, Your Honor, I believe what makes out the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum of punishment after they've committed their crimes. So they need to show that as an element. I   I see   I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I could.\n You may do so. Mr. Lewis.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents a straightforward opportunity to apply the Heck rule. Respondent Johnson's section  \n Can you tell us why   why is it still live when they   when they already received a second hearing? Or why is not moot?\n Johnson still has remaining claims for prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as well, declaratory relief. What may be mooted is his claim for retroactive injunctive relief, in other words, a new parole hearing. I think in order for him to pursue that type of a claim, he'd have to go back down to the district court.\n What   what is  \n Well, put in plain language what it is Johnson is claiming he's entitled to. I don't understand.\n Well, he   really three different things. He's requesting prospective injunctive relief, fix the due process violations that are going on in Ohio parole proceedings.\n Which is a new   a new parole hearing. Isn't   I mean, it   I  \n How could that be fixed?\n Yes. How   how can it be fixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?\n Well, he does have a class action. He filed a class action and he's trying to fix the proceeding prospectively. It doesn't necessarily require him to have a new parole hearing. He's still in confinement and will very likely have a new parole hearing, a new parole hearing that he wants the proceedings to be different in. He's not necessarily asking for a new parole hearing. He's saying  \n Why isn't he? If   if   what he's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I want you to do it right in the future.\n Sure. I think that was part of his claim, which might be mooted, but he's also saying in any future  \n No. It   it isn't mooted because he still got it done wrong. The second hearing was still wrong.\n Well, we don't  \n His claims here   if his claims here are correct.\n We don't know that for sure, but part of his claim as well is to say in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed to   to come into compliance with due process. And I think that's separate and apart from  \n You   you say we don't know whether the   the new parole hearing he got was still invalid?\n I don't think there's enough in the record to determine that.\n Oh, so we can assume that that was valid. You're   you're willing to assume that for purposes of this case?\n I am not willing to assume that. I   I don't think we can say one way or the other.\n Well,\n We can't yet.\n Okay, fine.\n We may intend to.\n Then we take it as valid. Then we take it as valid. That's not a claim you're challenging. But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he will have another hearing.\n Actually 2005.\n 2005? Okay, 2005 he'll have another hearing.\n Absolutely.\n And in the year 2005, I want not to have the   what are they called? The 1998 guidelines. I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the Constitution of the United States.\n That's correct.\n So you're saying he's going to have this. I want an injunction or declaratory relief they can't do it.\n That's right, and as well, he says I want to be heard at this next parole hearing. Now, that was   part of his due process allegations in this case were that he   he wasn't even allowed to meaningfully participate in  \n And he's saying it violates the Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.\n That's essentially it.\n That's it. Okay. We're talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it habeas?\n That's   that's correct.\n Okay.\n And   and it is section 1983 because it doesn't violate the Heck rule. This  \n And what   what is your   what is Johnson's mootness argument?\n Well, to the extent in his complaint he was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the challenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted because he has received this 2001 hearing and we just don't know enough about it to know whether he's going to challenge it or not. He'd have to amend his complaint in the district court.\n Could   is it possible that both Dotson and Johnson could get new hearings by   filing habeas  \n I don't think so.\n   petition?\n I don't think so. I don't think that Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because the Federal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality of custody, the legality of confinement, and that's not anything that he's challenging in this case.\n What would you do if there was an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past hearing? The parole commission was   was drunk or they read the wrong file or something, and it was just a challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would that be 1983 or habeas?\n I think that's a closer call, but I think it  \n That's why asked you. Why isn't it   (Laughter.)\n Right. And   and I   I think it is still section 1983 if certain things are present. That is, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the duration of his sentence by winning his case? And if that's meets the Heck rule and if he isn't, then I think he can proceed in section 1983.\n Do we have any case in which what was being   what was sought to be challenged in a habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was determined?\n I don't  \n Is there any   why   why shouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always   and referred to it as   as that in the past?\n Well, I think in the hypothetical that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical factor here.\n No, no, no, not necessarily. He   he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due process safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might   I might   have been given a shorter sentence. I can't prove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence really, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due process. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out earlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?\n Because it's not a challenge to the legality of the confinement.\n My law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly. One is called Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where she says that in those two cases people were using habeas to challenge prison conditions even. Now, so there are   there are two cases that, if she's right   and she's usually right   that   that   where habeas was used to challenge prison conditions. So I've thought, well, if they can use it, they certainly could use it here.\n Well, and I   I think point with   with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not come into play because the prisoners must have gone through and exhausted their State court remedies, and so there wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their claim in habeas.\n No. It was a different issue, but it said habeas could be brought.\n Sure. I think the Court in   in that particular case  \n So habeas could be brought here?\n I don't think so.\n Why not?\n I don't think there's a remedy in habeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the first thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the Federal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are you challenging the legality of your custody?\n Yes, and they say sure   sure I am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be released later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll say. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a shot.\n Right. And   and   but he's not necessarily challenging the legality of his custody.\n Well, but   but that's part of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to   to resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much different than if a judge   let's assume, under a proper sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong guideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. But that's   that's a classic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison for 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a classic habeas case?\n Because I think in   in the first hypothetical, Your Honor, that   that you gave, the challenge, if successful, would   would completely invalidate the sentence that he received. They'd have to redo the   the sentence. And   and I think that's the critical distinction in this case, is that when Johnson files his complaint, he has a 10- to 30-year sentence by the   by the State court. If he wins, he still has a 10- to 30-year sentence.\n Well, it wouldn't completely invalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to be held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.\n But in the hypothetical you propose, Justice Kennedy, the   the prisoner was actually   would be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by winning the case, he's going to undo the State court sentence.\n Yes, well, those cases happen to involve   happen to involve sentences. This case doesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to have his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought for that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say it would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have shortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is properly a habeas action, then we   we can get some language to make it fit.\n Well, I don't   I don't think it is properly a habeas action. I think even in the decisions where courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, I think it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner is already here. He's already exhausted all of his State court remedies. It doesn't really matter whether it's section 1983 or habeas.\n Suppose we wrote an opinion that said, whatever the reasoning   I don't know what it would be right now   that said in the future your client should go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to. But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought in habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said. We're absolutely making it clear just what the   would there be any harm done?\n I   I think there would be.\n Now, what would that harm be?\n I think that by   by having a rule of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction of habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwise cognizable section 1983 claims.\n And why would that be bad?\n And why  \n I'm sorry?\n Why would that be bad?\n Well, because the Congress has enacted a statute  \n No, no. But I mean, is   I'm asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer. Would it be bad?\n Absolutely it would.\n Because?\n Because there's a statute that allows  \n Well, I mean, leaving aside   Congress changed the statute. It says absolutely it's going to be habeas. Is there any bad consequence in the law?\n It's going to give States a license to violate civil rights that will otherwise not be protected under the statute.\n We'll catch them in habeas.\n Yes, but the   the State exhaustion requirements in habeas are much tougher. Of course, the State wants them to have to go through State exhaustion.\n Ah, so it comes down to that.\n That's really the critical  \n You said   you said a moment ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to expand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the prisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an immediate release case no matter what. Is that correct?\n That's correct.\n Okay.\n You would basically end up going to a Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for processes to be changed prospectively.\n And that's why they could not bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days does something. Is   is that the nub of it?\n That's   that's really it, Justice Souter.\n Well, I'm   I'm not sure. It depends how you formulate the order. The   the judge says, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless, within 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the guidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute works.\n Well, if that's the relief that the   the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a habeas claim. But that's not what Johnson is claiming in this case. He's not asking for entitlement to release at all. He's asking for the processes to be changed prospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking for declaratory relief.\n Regardless of what he's asking for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be entitled to any immediate release.\n That's absolutely correct.\n He would still have a sentence of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him out. Is that  \n That's   that's absolutely it. He cannot   by winning his case, he's not going to shorten his sentence in any way. And that's   that's a big distinction from the Balisok case where there was an automatic entitlement to a shorter sentence  \n Well, he might  \n   for Balisok in that case.\n   he might shorten the term of his confinement.\n Might but not necessarily. And this Court made very clear most recently in the Nelson decision  \n Well, you could say the same thing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but he might not. We're just   we're just hearing the case.\n I think a challenge to the sentence necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. But a challenge to parole is much different because you're not affecting the sentence if you win your case. And the term necessary is completely necessary to the Heck analysis, as this Court made clear most recently in the Nelson case from last term.\n That's the nub of it I guess. The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication for the validity of the sentence.\n That's absolutely right.\n In fact, it assumes the sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if he gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?\n That's really all it means. And this Court last term in Muhammad in   in footnote 1 made clear that the incarceration that matters for this analysis is the   in the incarceration of the sentence from the State court. And I think that's   that's what the Court needs to look at, is what is Johnson's effect on the State court judgment or sentence. What's the necessary implications? Not in this case at all. And really, this case I think has already been decided by Wolff. It's something that the petitioners sort of don't mention too much in their briefs. In Wolff, the prisoners in   in that case were trying to get their good-time credits back. I think this is an easier case than the Wolff decision. And what the Court did was parse out, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but you can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the processes that are used in connection with depriving prisoners of good-time credits. And that's precisely what Johnson is seeking here. Your Honor, the other thing I wanted to mention was the notion   Your Honors, the other thing I want to mention was the notion that there's no State review of these decisions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act clearly provides for State administrative review of even challenges to the process. So the   the State of Ohio could easily set up an appeal process administratively to   to correct that problem.\n Thank you, Mr. Lewis.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Untereiner, is it?\n Yes, Justice Stevens. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to, first of all, go to the point that Justice Ginsburg raised about the allegations in Mr. Dotson's complaint. This case has   has become much simpler with respect to Dotson because any claim that he might have had about this 2000 scheduling decision has been mooted. What's really left are claims for future injunctive relief, for prospective relief. These are classic 1983 type cases. Prisoners have been bringing lawsuits since Wolff against McDonnell alleging that parole procedures and other kinds of procedures, disciplinary procedures ought to be reformed and seeking future injunctive relief with respect to those kinds of   of procedures. In Edwards against Balisok, this Court indicated that ordinarily claims for prospective injunctive relief will not be barred by the Heck doctrine because ordinarily they will not call into question or necessarily imply the invalidity of any previous decision. So to Justice Breyer's question, this would require a change in the law, and it would, I think, fairly substantially cut back on the kinds of suits that have been brought for 30 years under Wolff because in all kinds of suits like this, the State would argue, as the petitioners are arguing today, that there's some prior administrative decision that's called into question by a future claim for injunctive relief with respect to some aspect of the procedures relating to good-time credit revocation or parole or the revocation of probation. So I think this would be a fairly substantial change in the law. A lot of these claims would be barred by Heck. The   Justice Scalia, you asked a question about the habeas, the scope of habeas relief. And I think it's important to understand that the lower courts have generally held that habeas is not available for these kinds of claims that are prospective only, seeking changes in future procedures. There are some lower court cases that say that where a prisoner seeks release on parole and demands a right or claims a right to release on parole, that might be cognizable in habeas, but the vast weight of authority in the lower courts is that claims that only seek an   the right to a new parole hearing, the outcome of which is completely discretionary  \n You want a 1983 hearing in which a United States district judge tells the parole commission, now, here are your marching orders for future cases. You have to comply with this rule, that rule, this rule. What is an analog that you can give us where United States courts have done this under 1983? Using an administrative case, if the   if the agency does it the wrong way, we reverse that decision. It would be like a review of a conviction that's not final. Have we had cases where under 1983 litigants come in and say, now, these agencies are doing it the wrong way? You have to   can you give me an analog?\n I think there   there are a fair number of cases in the lower court where   lower courts where these types of claims for injunctive relief have been brought and the Federal courts have ordered, on a prospective basis, that the States conform to all kinds of   I mean, Wolff is a case like that I think where the   the State was required to do certain things in the future. So I think these are ordinary 1983 claims for injunctive relief.\n Is there any significant difference between this case and Wolff? I mean, Wolff was a case of procedural fault supposedly, and if those faults were cured, someone would have a better chance at getting good-time credit. Wasn't that what  \n Yes.\n So it seems to me it's very   very close to your situation.\n It is very close, Justice Ginsburg. Dotson is essentially making two claims for prospective relief. He is saying that these 1998 parole guidelines effectively rescind his eligibility for parole. At the time of his conviction, he was entitled to parole after serving 15 years. Under these guidelines, he'll have to wait till   until 32 and a half years have passed before he's eligible for parole. And he's claiming that in   in his next parole release hearing, which is in June 2005 and beyond, the State is required to apply the old rules to him so that he'll be eligible. So this is very much like what was at issue in Wolff. The second claim he has is that he's entitled to annual parole release hearings in the future. Again, it's a future   it's a prospective claim only. In the future, he will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and the new rules say that the State can postpone those hearings for up until 10 years. So on both of those claims, he is seeking changes in the future, and these are classic 1983 type cases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 30 years in the lower courts. Now, the Heck test requires a showing that if he prevails on his section 1983 claims, he would   that would necessarily imply the invalidity of his underlying conviction or sentence. And I think this case is very different from the Balisok case. There   there was a colloquy about that earlier. I think that Balisok is clearly distinguishable because the administrative decision there would have had an immediate and direct impact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by   by revoking the good-time credits. Whereas, here, the impact is very, very speculative. Justice Souter, you referred earlier to a durational consequence. The durational consequence here is really quite hypothetical and remote. If he prevails on his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future hearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in Ohio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings. He'll also be entitled to   merely to be considered eligible for parole in the future. So I think that the   the consequences   any impact on   on the duration of his confinement is   is really quite hypothetical here and it would require an expansion not only of the Heck rule but also of habeas jurisdiction to resolve this case in the State's favor. Unless there are any further questions, we would ask that the Court affirm the Sixth Circuit's unanimous decision in favor of Dotson. All 11 members of that court found that Dotson's claims were not barred by Heck, and this Court should affirm.\n Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.\n Thank you, Your Honor. A number of points. I wanted to start by responding to Justice Souter's question, which was again asking about this need for entitlement to early release as part of habeas, and would ask the Court to consider the In re Braden case where a prisoner in Alabama was seeking to challenge a detainer that had been issued by Kentucky. And the basis for the challenge to the detainer in habeas was the fact that it was having implications for his parole eligibility in Alabama. So there, there was not going to be necessarily an entitlement to earlier release, but simply a difference in the parole considerations. Second, Justice O'Connor, with respect to your questions about mootness, the only point that I would add is that if this case is moot now, it was moot when the Sixth Circuit decided it as well. So if mootness is the direction we're going, I think there need to be a decision vacating the judgment below  \n Well, what's your position as to whether or not it's moot?\n Your Honor, we don't believe it's moot either, and in   in fact, for two reasons. First, once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing decision, albeit it not the one that was originally threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but there is a new one where that would have that consequence. In terms of bad consequences, I think the single biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to 1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts. The Layne decision in the last   decided just 2 years ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action about the way parole works in Ohio. They were successful and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving  \n But   but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio courts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have brought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts have jurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh, they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.\n That's true, Your Honor. At the same time, this   bringing this   this case in 1983 in Federal court means that they're not going to be able to get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst doctrine. So they are depriving themselves of a chance to get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are offering and that courts in other States are offering. The other   the other point I wanted to make is that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole revocations can't be in habeas either. A parole   parole   when you're on parole, you're still serving part of your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial term that the court has imposed upon you. Granted, you're not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't impact your sentence. It would merely bring you back into prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than having you serve it on the street. So I think that understanding of sentence can't make sense for   for habeas purposes.\n I think sentence means custody. Don't you think it means custody?\n Well, but to the extent we're talking  \n The custody you've been sentenced to?\n But to the extent we're talking about duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the claims here do have a   success on the claims here would have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement. This Court in Muhammad said   I think this is probably the   the closest quote on point   challenges to particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the province of habeas corpus. This is a challenge to a particular, the parole procedures, that's affecting the duration of their confinement. Or at least that's their allegations, and that's what success on their claims is going to mean. And because of those durational consequences, as well as because of the consequences of success on the merits for previous State parole decisions, we believe that those claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983. If there are no further questions.\n I had one further question. Are you asking us to change anything in Wolff against McDonnell, or can we follow that case?\n I think we can follow that case as it's been reinterpreted in Heck. Wolff said that   well, Heck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not   and I believe the language is   necessarily vitiate the underlying decision. So the way Heck understood Wolff was that the procedural challenges there, with regard to the prospective relief they were seeking, were not the type of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision that had already been made. Here, by contrast, the claims that they're bringing, the ex post facto claims, if they're successful on the merits, would necessarily vitiate the decisions that have gone before. Thank you, Your Honors.\n Thank you, Mr. Cole. The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Pesticides are economic poisons designed to kill living things. Sometimes they do not work as designed. For more than a century until the 1990's, courts routinely permitted farmers to bring claims against pesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by pesticides. In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972, Congress did not intend to displace those preexisting State law remedies. The farmers here allege claims for defective design, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of warranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that severely damaged their peanut crops. I'd like to start with our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate for three reasons why those claims survive preemption. The defective design and manufacturing claims challenge the product's composition, not its label. The fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or in addition to FIFRA requirements. Now, with respect to the first point, Dow concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective design and manufacturing claims generally are not preempted. That concession warrants a remand here, as this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers to develop their claims.\n But couldn't you make every failure to warn claim a defective design claim? That is, they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects would not have been present if the product had been designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse effect on the peanut crop.\n Justice Ginsburg, the way the Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1 and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that products liability claims can proceed on: a defective design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings. The restatement explains that they are distinct legal theories that go to different problems that the manufacturer has caused with respect to the product. A defective design claim asserts that the composition was inadequate and that a properly designed product could have been put on the market that would not cause the harm.\n Mr. Frederick, on the defective design claim, presumably that's based on a factual theory that Dow could have reasonably designed Strongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acid soil.\n Correct.\n But doesn't that mean your client should have to put forward some evidence establishing a material issue of disputed fact on that point?\n Certainly, but here  \n And it didn't do that.\n Well here, Your Honor, the motion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not based on the merits of the claims. It was based on them being preempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law. They also asserted a limitation of   of remedy provision. But we never had discovery in this case. The District Court, after finding jurisdiction, considered Dow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked us out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance to prove that a safer design for the product could have been made. And that's where we think the court's decision below was overbroad and should be reversed.\n The   the problem I have with   with the Government's case and with the respondent's case is that   it's really the obverse of what Justice Ginsburg said. Their problem is that they would recast everything as a warning.\n That's absolutely correct.\n Does the restatement have some specific provisions that say no matter how good the warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's a   I don't know   dangerous product or defective product or something?\n Yes. Restatement sections 1 and 2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if you can show that the product could have been reformulated to be properly designed, then the existence of a warning that might go to certain of its uses would not negate a defective design claim. The Texas Supreme Court  \n Even   even if the warning specifically covered that design defect?\n That   that's   that's correct. And what the restatement  \n So even if this product said, warning: may not be effective in high pH soils, that's not good enough?\n Under the restatement rule, which Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've cited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true because the restatement explains that there are certain warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not understood properly and that if it can be proved that a properly designed product would be on the market, there are public policy reasons why that's what we want to encourage manufacturers to do. I mean, under  \n At any cost? I mean, what if it   you know, yes, I can   I can sell you stuff that will   that will work in high pH soil, but it's going to be three times as effective. Do I have to sell it?\n Well, the  \n Can't I just sell it for those people who don't need it for   for high pH soil at a third the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way, don't use this in high pH soil? It's crazy to say you can't do that.\n Justice Scalia, to answer your question in several ways, that's a jury determination to   to ascertain the reasonableness of the alternate design that the manufacturer would be asked to   to do or to market a separate product that was separately designed for high-acid soils.\n But it's never a question of the reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?\n I don't think it's a question of warning in this sense, Justice Kennedy. If you take their theory, which is that a defective design claim always collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a defectively designed product that admittedly causes harm, and all they have to do is change the label and say, if used in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm, because that would necessitate a change to the label  \n Oh, not necessarily. It wouldn't be always either way. I would think that if in fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not having designed the super-safe product or the unreasonableness consists of not having had a different label.\n And that   there are   that's why the restatement makes clear that there are distinctive theories for defect  \n And you're arguing that in this case you have the first.\n That's correct.\n It seems implausible on   you know,  \n Well, we have both actually.\n   because all they'd have to do is don't use it in pH soil.\n No. We have defective warning too, and   and if I can address that as well. The statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or misleading statement in the label as to any particular. Our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are grown. That was false. Under the statute, that is a misbranding, and that is actionable as   both as a failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of warranty. Now, the Medtronic majority made absolutely clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in fact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law claim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the existence of a State law remedy is not an additional requirement.\n So on   on that aspect of the case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation of FIFRA.\n We don't necessarily need to say a violation of FIFRA is   so long as the requirement is the same, although we can certainly  \n Well, that's a   that's a bit different. You were   you were asserting a moment ago I thought   please correct me if I'm wrong   that this was a violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.\n I  \n It seems to me that you then have a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was the theory of your complaint.\n No. The theory of our complaint was a failure to warn both for negligence and as a defective product.\n But the reason for that, I take it, is that FIFRA does not   I mean, I think you agree FIFRA does not provide an independent private right of action.\n That's correct.\n So you've got to sue under State law, but you would   you would kind of have a slam dunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said, the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the   the warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an inadequate warning. That would   that would keep you within the   the   in effect, the   the Federal limit, and it would also make clear that you had a State law cause of action, not a Federal cause of action.\n That's correct, and because  \n And   and that's in effect what you're arguing.\n Yes. And   and because of the preliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly should have the opportunity to amend our complaint. There are counterclaims that this is done at the motion for declaratory judgment.\n In your view   in your   your opinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA   suppose EPA does the following. EPA looks into this and they publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think that State tort suits will interfere with our ability to promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're preempted. Can the EPA do that on your theory?\n Yes, it can and the   the interesting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of course EPA hasn't done that. EPA has made very clear it never tested for efficacy. It never even gave notice and comment so that  \n Well, EPA has   has waived efficacy data requirements. Right?\n Yes.\n Now, is it your position that a State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy claims?\n They have to do it pursuant to their powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale or use or under 136v(c) which says that when a State designates a particular locality requirement and a special need, it can impose a label   it can impose requirements that the manufacturer has to comply with. Now, the EPA importantly   and this is in their regulations at 163.152   has specifically said that States have labeling authority. The States can impose labeling requirements. Now, there's no reason why  \n But you're not relying on that in this cause of action.\n No, Justice   no, Justice O'Connor, except to the extent that if the State can affirmatively do it through a positive regulation, their theory has to be wrong that the   that any incidental effect that induces a change to label is preempted. That theory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuit relied on.\n Well, does   does FIFRA require the manufacturer to say on the label what the item can be used for?\n Yes, but I want to address  \n So how   how does an express warranty claim escape preemption  \n As the  \n   where   where Dow just says the federally mandated statement is included on my label and it's true?\n A warranty claim, Justice O'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case, is not a requirement under State law because it's a voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties. The Court I think has made clear that what has to be ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the State law create a requirement. That's not true in the warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements in   as to warranties. It speaks to requirements in other ways. So what Dow did here with its warranty was completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that warranty by putting on the market a product that was not suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook. Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State law. And that has been, I think, verified by seven Justices of this Court in the   in the Cipollone case. Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where there are general legal duties that are not observed by the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product itself, those claims are not preempted. Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market a   a product that was mislabeled and that they went out and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses. We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages. Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific ones. And the existence of the preemption clause of 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try to prove to a court that fraud was committed here. Now, if I could briefly address two points. One is that the inducement to change theory should be rejected. That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for several reasons. First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b) which says requirements for labeling. It doesn't say requirements that induce a change to the label. And that's how many of the courts have gone off track since the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court. They have read FIFRA as saying just because the word requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to change the label is thereby preempted. We think that's overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced to change the label. Because EPA does not evaluate the specific contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are made on   on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to court and say we would have to change the label and thereby 136v(b) preempts it. Now, I'd also like to stress that the other side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. As your question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not evaluate efficacy on the front end. And in fact, the history behind these provisions is that EPA understood from the very beginning that common law claims would serve an important incidental regulatory effect. If we could review the history for a moment. Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers had brought claims against manufacturers for design defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law claims that we have asserted in this case. It was so well established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and explained what the common law duties of pesticide manufacturers were. Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there is not one mention of any effort to displace those preexisting common law claims. And when EPA, in discharging its responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by the requirement that it re-register products that were already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't do this. Congress responded, but importantly in the administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor General changed the position of the Government, that these kinds of incidental common law suits would have an important regulatory effect. If we could just take the case of DDT. For 30 years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages until it became clear that the groundswell over the course of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only at the back end that the expert agency regulators determined that in fact the product needed to be banned, but that was only after a very long history in which common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and others who were harmed by that product. Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater products than had been done in the Carter administration in 1979. And in the Federal Register notice announcing that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who put on the market ineffective products. We cited that on page 31 of our brief.\n But do you take the position that juries can do what a State regulation cannot do, or are they much   are they on a par?\n Well, our broadest theory, Justice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b) doesn't include common law claims at all.\n Suppose we disagree with that.\n If you disagree with that, then they would have to be the same, and that's why our point about the existence of the parallel requirements is the same. I want to address the point of the discordance between what State juries can decide and what State regulators can decide because Dow and the Government have featured that in their case. The Government in the Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said there was no problem to be had with juries rendering supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were following one Federal standard. The Federal standard here is clear: falsity. Tell the truth. That's what manufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and under the regulations.\n Well, that's their strong point. So what is the response to that? Because you can easily get two juries in different parts of the country to decide absolutely opposite things as to what the label should say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're in an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed this statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries in different places.\n First, the juries   unlike a   a declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy, Justice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is not saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.\n I'm speaking practically. And I don't have to go into all the argument.\n Sure.\n You know the argument. It's a very familiar argument.\n Sure. The answer is that   that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b   surround   by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow States to depart in significant respects from what was nationally uniform. And the way it did so was to say States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose extra requirements for special locations. Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a problem was identified with their product in the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label a supplemental label. And that supplemental label says it is for distribution in those three States only and it provided 10 important changes to the label that it otherwise had as a nationally uniform label. That's how the system is supposed to work. If the incidental regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that can be done without an adverse effect to national uniformity through the supplemental labeling process. And what Dow did here was it has its label and then it attaches the supplemental label that addresses the particular conditions that exist in the State. And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly appropriate and valid way to address the geographic, environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the different regions of the country that engage in agriculture. There's nothing that is uncertain about that if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow the appropriate Federal standard. Now, I would like to turn   sorry. Did you   no, go ahead. I would like to turn briefly to the   the requirements aspect of the case because we do think that, under our broadest theory, this is a different situation than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important statutory indications that are in the provision 136v. Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from Medtronic. Where in Medtronic there was a provision that allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to requirements and whether or not the States should be displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a) and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be imposed. They're in addition to what the Federal standard is. That means that you have to look at requirements in a somewhat different way because the States have this authority that they did not have under the Medical Device Amendments. There's a textual indicator under (b) also which refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that shall issue these requirements. Such   the meaning of it in Webster's means what has been already described   is in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate regulations. So we think that there is a textual basis for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court   five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would encompass common law claims. If there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the balance  \n Let me ask one because I think you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute, which is the   the statute sets up a perfectly good way of keeping this branded stuff off the market. All any complaining farmer has to do is to go to EPA and ask them to pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction. It's like the atomic bomb on the company. And so that's very strong. And the only thing that leaves out is the possibility of damage remedies, but if you want your damage remedy, just go to EPA and tell them to give it to you because they can write the rule the other way that I was suggesting.\n Well, I don't think that EPA could write a rule requiring damages to be done. It doesn't have the statutory authority  \n They would just say it doesn't preempt.\n Well, there's no indication here that EPA can do that kind of thing. In FIFRA, it certainly doesn't have that kind of provision. I mean, certainly there are different ways that the statute could have been written. That isn't the choice that Congress made. Thank you.\n Mr. Waxman.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: FIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress specifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity, preempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling different from those required under FIFRA.\n Why   why doesn't the other amendment limit your argument? Because Congress has also passed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses to get in to the business of   of passing on efficacy, it   it need not do so. And in fact we know it is not doing so. Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of   of the   the whole preemption claim?\n There are   there are two fundamental reasons. The first is that it is a principal requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains, that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide with the precise labeling to the word and font size that EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the wording relates to human safety, environmental protection, or efficacy. Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr. Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA to Congress   and Congress'   the   the committee report plainly indicates this   that the EPA was not saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no longer concerned with efficacy. What they said was because the Department of Agriculture and the extension services and the State universities are all involved in this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for registration, even submit a registration application, the manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing, which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive  \n But it's not monitored at all. The   the manufacturer can say   make up reports and EPA is never going to look at it.\n If the manufacturer makes up reports, it has committed a felony. EPA can enforce it. It can refer it to the Attorney General. It's just like the  \n But maybe it isn't a labeling violation. I mean, there are claims made here that I have trouble shoehorning into your theory. For instance, why does a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its product on peanuts on acid soil impose a label requirement?\n Justice  \n I   I just don't understand that.\n Justice O'Connor, I think   I will address the negligent testing and, of course, the design defect  \n Yes.\n   discussion that's figured so prominently in my colleague's argument. It's very, very important to understand that unlike in Sprietsma and Medtronic and so many of the   and, for that matter, with respect to the preempted claims in Cipollone, the claims that were preempted below, we didn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss. We couldn't have with respect to at least one of those two claims. We filed a motion for summary judgment that said with respect to   let me take design defect first. With respect to design defect, it is possible under Texas State law to state a claim for products liability under defective design without impeaching the labeling. And there is a brief filed in this case by Dean Powers, the University of Texas Law School, for the   the Texas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law, and he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why they are all preempted and all invalid under independent and adequate State grounds. But what we did is we didn't move to dismiss. We filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion for summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this case to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, and we said, in effect, we know that you can allege a design defect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we think that what you are complaining about does impeach the labeling. Therefore, show us what you have. Now, under rule 56, they had two alternatives. They could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule 56(f), as this Court referenced in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made. We don't know how this was tested. We don't know how this was manufactured. We're entitled to discovery, and district courts recognize that all the time. What they did  \n And they didn't do that?\n They did not do that, and what they did was to submit affidavits and documentary evidence, including expert affidavits.\n Mr.   Mr. Waxman, you said they didn't file a motion to dismiss. I thought you brought the lawsuit.\n We brought the lawsuit and we  \n But then they couldn't file  \n No, no, no. I said we didn't file a motion to dismiss  \n You didn't file a motion to dismiss your own complaint?\n No, no. Their counterclaims.\n Oh, okay.\n In other words, this wasn't decided   Mr. Frederick's reply brief talks over and over and over again about how this was decided on the pleadings, and you know, there was no discovery allowed. Under rule 56, they could have asked for discovery when we basically said, okay, let's show our hands. We got two jacks. What do you got? And what their expert said and what their response said was if the 2001 amended label had been on it, we wouldn't have been injured. Now, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose a summary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, the burden is on the adverse   the adverse party must by affidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and they didn't do that. Now, the classic design defect   let me   let me give you an example.\n Well, let's just try to boil it down a little bit for my purposes. Do you concede that there could be a claim based on no testing  \n Well  \n   that there could be a claim based on design defect, that there could be a claim saying there were off-label oral statements made that amounted to fraud or misleading  \n I'll take them in your precise order.\n Okay.\n Under Texas law   and the Court of Appeals opinion, the Grinnell opinion cited by the Court of Appeals opinion, says this, as does Dean Powers. Under Texas law, negligent testing is not an independent tort. It is of necessity a subset of inadequate warnings. It is an element of a   the tort   the claim of product defect related to warnings. And so it is not possible under Texas law, settled Texas law. Other States are different, but Texas in its sovereign capacity has chosen to make claims of negligent testing an element of the tort of defective product by failure to warn, and that  \n And the way you proceeded in this case, you made it clear that it would be impossible for the Texas court itself to weigh in on this because you jumped the gun. They wanted to proceed in Texas court, and then we would have known what Texas law was on these subjects. You said, no, we want to be in the Federal forum.\n We want   as the   as the Fifth Circuit found and the District Court found, we filed a declaratory judgment in Texas after we received their demand letters because we wanted this to be adjudicated in a single forum, which the Texas venue rules would not have allowed, and we   we actually filed this in Lubbock, Texas, which is the geographic center of where these 29 farmers operate. Now, with respect to defective design, yes, under Texas law if they had a   they have to allege and they have to prove that there is a safer alternative design for this product, which they never even introduced one quantum of evidence about. But  \n It seems to me you're   you're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than the preemption issue.\n Well, what we said was your claims are preempted if they impeach the labeling that we are required by Federal law to use.\n But they now say they don't. They ought to be able to proceed on those claims. What do we do with that?\n Well, what this   what   what happens under rule 56  \n And also the   also the claims of false, misleading statements outside the label.\n Yes. I'm going to get to the false and misleading statements outside the labeling in a minute, but just to finish the design defect point, they filed a complaint   a counterclaim which had as a count this was defectively designed. It is possible under Texas law to prove that something is defectively designed. If they had come in and said, but we filed a motion for summary judgment that says here's our evidence and we don't think that you can satisfy   that you are, in fact, complaining about a defective design  \n But if they did allege a defective design claim under Texas law, would that have been preempted?\n No. If   if they had said, look, the problem with this, which as footnote 9 of our brief indicates, it's not a  \n It seems to me your argument is not whether there's preemption. It's whether there's a State cause of   State law cause of action.\n No, no, no. It's   it's both. With respect to defective design, what we said is, your claim is preempted because you aren't going to go to the jury on defective design without impeaching the label. If we're wrong, prove it in response to our summary judgment submission.\n But you can  \n Is that their burden?\n It is  \n Is that their burden or is your burden to show  \n It is   it is absolutely their burden in   as the responding party to a motion for summary judgment, to show that there are material facts that are either in dispute or there are material facts that would allow them to go to the jury.\n But on your theory there is no material fact, it seems to me, because your   what you say they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching the label.\n And they  \n Every time they sue on the   on the ground that   let's say, that   that the   the actual use was inconsistent with what the label described, you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have to change our label to say that what's on the label now is in fact not properly descriptive of the product. So it's not a   a question of needing more fact. On your theory, whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law, well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else. That impeaches the label. Therefore, preemption.\n That is exactly right. What they could have done in response to our motion for summary judgment is to say this product assertedly harms   when it is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the product it is   the plant that it's supposed to protect if the soil pH is too high. They could have easily have come back and said if they had a   a design defect claim that didn't impeach the label to say you should have   there was a way to manufacture this product. You could have it in pellet form rather than in the soluble form or if the problem was the alkalinity of the soil, there is a way to design this so that it is dissolved in a more acidic solution. The classic case, which is referenced in the NRDC brief, which has many, many examples of true design defect claims that don't impeach labels, is a case involving rat poison. It's a case called Banks v. ICI America. It's a Georgia Supreme Court  \n So you quite clearly have both. I understand that. Let me ask you a question about the   the preemption point because what I think they're saying is go read the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there you see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory requirements, regulation. And I think one of their claims is we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without any change in the regulatory, that   that it was violated. These are false. They're misbranded. So we are not imposing a requirement different from or in addition to the requirement of Federal law. We are enforcing a requirement that is the same as the requirement of Federal law, and if, by the way, the EPA were to think that tort suits in those circumstances in practice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a regulation to that effect. But they haven't. Now, what   what is the answer to that argument?\n The answer is threefold. Number one, a challenge to a   the wording of a statement on the label on the grounds that it is false and misleading is   does impose a requirement different than Federal law, not the requirement that   that labeling not be false and misleading, but the fundamental requirement that a   unless and until the EPA says otherwise, the manufacturer can only sell this product with the precise labeling that EPA has approved. And it   if you look at page 63a  \n Mr. Waxman, do I  \n   of the joint appendix  \n Mr. Waxman, do I take it from what you have just said that there is no   even though the statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way that that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is something strictly for EPA to deal with, that the statute has a prohibition on misbranding? I can see the argument that all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says no misbranding. So is EPA the only the player in the misbranding  \n Insofar as labeling is concerned, the answer is yes, and that's because the statute   the statute has many, many instances in which it makes it clear that in service of the objective of a nationally uniform label, the expert agency that approves and dictates the language of that label be the one to decide what is or isn't  \n Mr. Waxman  \n Where does it say that?\n   can I ask you one question here?\n Because you were just going to point out where it says that  \n It goes to your  \n   which I think is  \n Excuse me.\n I'm sorry.\n Just let me ask this one question. Supposing the label says, this product contains vitamin A. Period. And it doesn't contain vitamin A, and they prove that in court. And you say you would have to change the label. I suggest you could change the product by putting vitamin A in it.\n Well, you can   you're  \n Why isn't that an answer to the misbranding? You change the product not necessarily the label.\n Because the difference between a   that would be a   a manufacturing defect, which are cases that have been decided  \n It would be a false statement in the label. The label happened to be false, a misrepresentation in it.\n If   if the   if it contains   I'm sorry. Was it vitamin A? If it contains vitamin A because that's what the manufacturer intended and that's what the manufacturer produced  \n No. The manufacturer knew it didn't contain it. He falsely put that in the statement  \n Oh, I see. Said that  \n   and   and it's   it's a misbranded, false statement. Now, does he have to change the label or could he change the product?\n Well, I believe that you have   you would have to   I mean, would it be efficacious with vitamin A? I don't know, but if it   if it requires a change in the label, it has to be done by EPA because the manufacturer commits a Federal law violation if it sells the product with any different label. If you   if I can just direct the Court's attention to  \n No, but I'm suggesting he could sell the product with the same label if he just changed the product to correct the misstatement.\n Well, the test, as the Fifth Circuit stated, Justice Stevens, is whether a judgment against Dow   I'm quoting. Quote: whether a judgment against Dow would cause it to need to alter the Strongarm label. I'm   and that's the   those are   that's the test that was applied here and is always applied.\n Okay, but why  \n That is, does the State law cause of action   is it premised on a State law duty that there   that different labeling be used  \n No, but neither  \n   that is, a little bit different than what Federal law requires.\n The problem that I think some of   several of us are having is that both the   as I understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument draws no distinction between the two following kinds of situations. Situation A: there's something that the manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the label, but the manufacturer didn't. Situation B: the manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is wrong and in Justice Stevens' example is in fact false and it causes harm. It makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the ground that I bought it in reliance on the label, the label was false, I should get damages for   for whatever harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for preemption purposes differently from the situation in which the   the manufacturer made no false statement. He simply should have said more. And if   if you don't distinguish between those two situations, then the   the prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing because   because it can never be enforced, in effect, except with respect to some prospective user. It can never be enforced with respect to the actual user.\n Justice Souter, that is a choice that Congress could have made. It is plainly not a choice that Congress did make because it applied the preemption provision to requirements that are either in addition to or different than. And whether a label is assertedly misleading because it fails to include something on the EPA-approved label or  \n Requirements for labeling or packaging  \n Yes.\n   that are in addition to or different.\n Yes. I   I  \n Requirements for labeling or packaging.\n Yes, and   and if it   if the  \n Yes, and the argument that's being made is that we ought to   we ought to read   we ought to read the limitation, which Justice Scalia has just described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in a relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward and, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the two kinds of situations.\n The allegation in this suit   the claims in this suit   and I   I see that my time has expired.\n Ms. Blatt.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: It would entirely destroy the uniformity contemplated by   contemplated by the statute if the EPA-approved and mandated label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation based on a jury's determination of whether a label is false.\n This is a new position for the Government, isn't it?\n Yes, we have  \n You used to take the opposite position.\n That's right.\n And we're dealing here, as   nobody has mentioned it, but there   there's a clear statement rule for preemption, isn't there? Doesn't the preemption of   of traditional State powers have to be clear in the statute?\n We   we think subsection (b) is unambiguous in preempting any statement.\n It's   it's ambiguous enough that the Government   the   the chief beneficiary of the   of the supposed preemption didn't see it. It used to come out the other way. How can you possibly say it's clear?\n Well, the agency is allowed to change its position and we realize  \n I understand. It's   it's welcome to change it, but it   it's one thing to change it. It's another thing to change it and come in to say that the question is clear.\n Well, we think that   we realize that our position was inconsistent with not only the Court's decision in Cipollone and in Medtronic that recognizes that requirement extends to common law duties. But more importantly, a system where a jury-by-jury on the same facts could come up with completely different reasons why a label is false  \n So   so if you have one administration thinking the one thing and the other thinking the other thing, why isn't the answer that the agency can promulgate the reg it wants? And therefore if the reg   if the agency comes to that conclusion, let them promulgate that reg. And if a different one thinks it can work with the tort suits, let them promulgate that reg.\n Well, unlike Medtronic where preemption occurred by virtue of the FDA's regulation, under FIFRA there's preemption by virtue of the statute itself. And I just want to give one  \n Yes, but why isn't there a big difference, for purposes of your argument, between the Medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in this case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? And EPA does nothing on the subject of efficacy.\n Well, that's just not true, with all due respect. I mean, they   the   we don't verify the accuracy of the efficacy labeling, but the requirement, both in the preemption provision and in the requirement to use the EPA label, clearly extends to efficacy. And you can have disuniform context whether it's safety or efficacy. Imagine a label that directs a product to be mixed for 20 minutes. One jury could find the label was false because the product should have only been mixed for 10 minutes. Another jury in the same courthouse could find the label was false because the product should have been mixed for at least 30 minutes. And this case is another really good example. Now the petitioners are saying the label says that the soil only should be a 7.2 level. Their expert says  \n Yes, but the remedy to that would not necessarily be to change the label. It might be to change the quality of the product that requires how much time for mixing.\n And we think it's critical that our position is that this statute only operates in the area of labeling, and it preempts only those State labeling requirements  \n What do you say about my vitamin A example?\n I think your vitamin A example is an excellent example of a non-preempted claim. If a manufacturer says that this is a pesticide and he puts Clorox in the bottle, the plaintiff wants to get to the jury on the theory that a reasonable manufacturer would not have used Clorox. He would have used the pesticide. If the argument, on the other hand, is Clorox was fine. I don't have a problem with Clorox, I just wish I would have been given a warning, but that's not the way a plaintiff would frame his complaint. We think it's critical that our theory is if the plaintiff's theory of recovery is necessarily   necessarily predicated on a requirement that the manufacturer used a label different than the EPA-approved label the Federal law required it use  \n Well, let's   let's be specific here. If it's a failure to test, if it's a   a design defect requirement, if it's an off-labeled, false misrepresentation, why are they preempted?\n On the face of the complaint, we agree that they're not preempted. Our only position is by the time it got to summary judgment, the courts decided that they had no evidence on what would have been non-preempted claims. If another farmer wants to bring an expert that says Strongarm can be manufactured  \n But then do you endorse the theory of the Court of Appeals in this case?\n Well, we think the Court of Appeals took it claim by claim and read the affidavit   or at least the District Court did  \n And you think just mere inducement to change a label is sufficient to create preemption.\n Mere inducement only to the extent that that's a shorthand way of saying the label was   necessarily had to be required. Let me give you an example.\n If Congress wanted that, surely it could have stated it more clearly than simply saying the State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging. A tort suit because of   of mislabeling is not a requirement for labeling or packaging.\n If the  \n And if Congress wanted to say that, they could have said it.\n Well, I think they did say if a common law duty is necessarily premised on the requirement that the manufacturer used a different label than Federal law required him to use. In this case, the common law duty of a failure to warn is saying the manufacturer should have put something on  \n You have   you have that provision which talks about requirements for labeling or packaging in conjunction with another provision that authorizes the State to regulate the sale or use.\n The  \n I mean, you   you have to make sense of the two.\n Right, and that's  \n And it seems to me that means the State can impose certain requirements upon the seller to the consumer  \n Not on labeling. Justice Scalia, every day  \n Well, every change   virtually every change   virtually everyone   if   if you believe the respondent's theory, virtually any State regulation of the substance of the sale will require a change in the label.\n That's just not true. Every day States and localities around the country are imposing use restrictions. They tell   they tell applicators and users when and where to apply the pesticide and what types of  \n Sale   sale or use is what it says.\n That's right and they  \n Say   if they regulate the sale or use.\n That's right, and they do that every day without imposing labeling requirements. Imagine   imagine  \n Give me sale examples.\n They require the manufacturer, in order to sell the product, be registered with the State, and they can impose whatever sale restrictions they want  \n And can they  \n   that don't go to the labeling.\n Can they do the same thing by   through jury verdicts?\n Absolutely not. It would be bad enough if a manufacturer had to shop his label around 50 States and had each  \n So now   so now you say a State can do something by regulation that a jury can't do.\n No. A State absolutely cannot impose labeling restrictions on a manufacturer.\n I'm asking if the   if juries can do anything that the   are   are prohibited under your view from doing anything that the State could do by a State regulation.\n Right. I'm sorry. Right. Under   it   the alternative theory would give more power to the jury to impose labeling restrictions than the State, and we don't think the State can do it. And it would be far more pernicious if a label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation. No one would read the label, much less understand it.\n Ms. Blatt, there's a brief in this case   there's a brief in this case that just shows hundreds, if not thousands, of crop damage claims. And your theory is that with this ambiguous provision Congress wiped all that out. It's hard to believe.\n No. Congress just wiped out labeling and only those labeling requirements  \n But everything becomes   but every   every time   my crop was stunted. Okay. You have to change the label so you can't bring that suit.\n Justice Ginsburg, it's just not true. The lower courts well understand this distinction, and they   they let go all the time claims as not preempted that are true manufacturing defect or true design defect claims. This is not a complete immunity. This is a narrowly targeted one as to labeling. There is a famous example of the Benlate  \n He says their claim is   is very simple. You didn't tell us that using this in our kind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill the weeds.\n Right.\n But you're saying that kind of claim can't be brought anymore.\n It can be brought if there's State law and evidence to support the State law that doesn't attack the labeling. And our  \n I've described a set of facts which your position I think you have to say affects the label. The   the farmer says I bought this bottle. It said okay for all peanuts. My crop grew and it was stunted and the weeds stayed alive.\n If they found an expert that said if you had manufactured this differently or if you had designed it differently and there was evidence to support that, our view is that those claims aren't preempted. And the alternative to let juries  \n No. I'm not giving you that case. I'm giving you exactly what happened.\n This case   they didn't have any evidence other than saying that the label was inaccurate. But the next   another jury could rely on the respondent's evidence to say the label was inaccurate because it works better on high pH soil, and another jury could say, well, we need a margin of safety and the label should have said 6.8 instead of 7.0, which is what their expert says. And you can have this time and time again with how often the pesticide has to be applied, when it has to be applied. And to   and the   the whole point of section 136v(b) was to have reliability  \n Was that happening when EPA took the opposite view? Was there this tremendous disparity with juries going every which way  \n Well, there's   there's been preemption at least since the late '80's, and I don't know of cases where juries   or the theory for recovery was invalidating the label. There are lots of cases that are true manufacturing defect claims, and I direct your attention to the Benlate where the manufacturer contaminated his product. If I'm the plaintiff, my theory   the theory was you mismanufactured this product. A reasonable manufacturer would have taken practices to prevent contamination, and it destroyed a lot of crops and EPA actually took enforcement action against that manufacturer. The rat poisoning example   a 9-year-old kid died of rat poisoning because it tasted like a candy bar. The theory of recovery was all the manufacturer had to do was put a bittering agent in it that would have made the kid throw up and the rats still would have loved the poisoning. That has nothing to do with the label.\n Thank you, Ms. Blatt. You have about 4 minutes.\n I just have two points to make. With respect to the summary judgment posture of the case, the way this unfolded was that on one day the District Court decided the motion for jurisdiction, that it had jurisdiction. On the very next day, Dow rushed into court with its motion for summary judgment. And what Mr. Waxman cites as the Celotex invocation merely says that on   on this point it is neither unfair nor premature to require defendants to produce evidence in support of their claims now as the Celotex trilogy requires. I'm reading from their motion for summary judgment. That was filed before the counterclaims. The only thing that they knew about was the deceptive trade practices notice letter that the farmers had filed pursuant to State law. So they didn't know what our claims were, and they were requiring or saying that the District Court could throw us out of court without giving us any opportunity to file counterclaims, much less try to develop evidence that would prove them. Now, with respect to the disuniformity point, when Congress amended the statute in 1988 to add the word uniformity, it said in that public law that it was a technical amendment. We don't know why Congress put the word uniformity in. The legislative history is barren. It just says this is a technical amendment. It didn't change the substantive provisions that empowered States to impose regulations that would have the effect of disuniformity. Now, at the end of the day, we've got claims that have been brought historically since the late 19th century. Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there were decades in which juries made these decisions with respect to these kinds of products, and those preemption decisions really didn't take hold until after this Court announced Cipollone in 1992. And it was only at that point that the courts began to have preemption, but for the previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these kinds of cases. The sky did not fall. EPA didn't come in and say there's labeling disuniformity as a result of this. There simply were no problems. But what did happen was that the farmers who used products were able to get compensation when pesticides damaged their crops. Thank you.\n The case is submitted.\n"}
