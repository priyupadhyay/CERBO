{"argument No. 03-1488, Ulysses Tory v. Johnnie L. Cochran ": " Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this Court emphasized once again that statutory interpretation is a holistic process based on common sense, that the reading of the statute should look at all the words to avoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the text does not dictate it and the statutory history suggests otherwise.\n That was a case I dissented in, wasn't it?\n Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia, I think even you will find our case more appealing.\n Yes, but   but it is true you have a strong textual  \n We have an excellent textual argument.\n I was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.\n We do. A holistic reading of the text shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code  \n What does a holistic reading mean? Can you stay within the  \n Absolutely.\n   text and still be holistic?\n I'm not going to look outside the text at all. A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, which is on   in the petitioners' brief at pages 1 through 2  \n What does the word holistic mean? (Laughter.)\n I think it means read all the words in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word artificially. For example, when you look at a phrase like on account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in North LaSalle, account means a lot of different things, but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this statute.\n So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?\n I think it'd be partial, but I'm not sure.\n Well, let   let me ask  \n Sure.\n   ask you this. The   the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the   the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.\n Yes, and I think payments are triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of retirement payments. For individuals  \n Well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty.\n Right, and that's not  \n And   and that isn't then on the basis of age. Am I right? Is that   that was the problem the court had below.\n Yes, that's the problem the court had below. I think it's an illusory problem for the following reason. It's clear that the right to receive full enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until one of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the estate, death. And that's the right that we're talking about here, and that's why  \n Well, when you say full enjoyment, you   you think when   when I'm taxed on something, I   I don't have full enjoyment of it? The only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell   the only thing triggered by age   is your obtaining of a tax benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you can withdraw it without   without paying the 10 percent tax.\n That's correct, but the 10 percent tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a deterrent and a penalty.\n Well, I'm sure it does, but   but it's   it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n Well, Justice Scalia, the way that I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a penalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because the holistic sense, the full reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled, or ill people, once they get to the point where those triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur. Those are the same triggering events  \n Ms. Karlan, the   as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are   there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One thing that I don't know and may be of some significance, did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it over?\n Northrop Grumman's policy is to require individuals who leave the company's employment to roll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried to get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they were unable to do because of their health, they could have rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely exemptible.\n Another employer's plan.\n That's correct.\n But they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?\n No. This employer did not permit individuals to keep the money in the plan. They were told they had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.\n That was a term of the plan that it   you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?\n Apparently so.\n Are there any other plans that are   are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n All right. Well, then  \n Let me give you a couple  \n   then you might persuade me.\n Let me give you a couple of examples  \n Okay.\n   that I think will be quite familiar. A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money before you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and you pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so. The Federal Government's thrift savings plan for Federal employees allows you to take a loan out of the plan and to pay the interest back into your own account before you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving you free use of the money. If you don't pay the loan back, it's then treated as a   as a distribution, and you pay the 10 percent tax penalty on it. So that if you read this statute to   not to include IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this statute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern forms of defined contribution pension plans or savings plans.\n Yes. That was what I was going   aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock bonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n I thought they were all in the same boat. So what the effect of this rule is   of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to qualify  \n Yes, that's correct. You would render section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.\n Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit. Excuse me.\n Yes. I   I can see why you might have thought it was the Ninth Circuit. (Laughter.)\n It   it might be wrong anyway. (Laughter.)\n Yes, yes.\n What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?\n Well, in the Cilek case from the Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under the penalty process.\n And the   the payment here   it says   the statute uses the word payment. So suppose you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?\n It would be because it's the right to the future payments and not just the present payments, Justice Breyer.\n So   so   but I'm trying   what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take   just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a   a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.\n That's correct, Justice Breyer. But in order to protect the ability to take money out after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a half, there won't be any money there for him to take out. And that's why the exemption extends not just to present payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the debtor. And I can't emphasize  \n Ms. Karlan, let me ask something about that very point because the statute says that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor it's allowable.\n Yes, Justice O'Connor.\n Are you aware of cases where the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all that money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that. We'll just let you deduct X amount.\n Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the yellow brief on pages 19 through   to 20, I think is where we   where we talk about  \n Can we take this concrete case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something over $42,000.\n Yes.\n What was the claim here as to   was part or all of that   it would be some $54,000.\n The claim was all that all of that was necessary. If I could give an example that I think Justice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally require turnover of the entire IRA because people have time to earn the money back again. When the debtor has other retirement savings, for example, in a case from Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a 401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire IRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of at   will also require turnover of at least part of the IRA. In this case  \n What   what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that? It seems to me  \n Well, if the client is ill now, they get to keep it  \n No, no. They   they say my client is able-bodied now, but we   we need something because   I don't know   there's a history of family illness or something.\n There isn't a reported case that talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason of exempting the money.\n It's   I'm trying to figure out how   how   what the theory is. Is   you say I have a right to receive payments because of age. And you say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is   is   stops the   the younger person getting the money. So does the case then turn on that? I mean, suppose   suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work. What's the right analysis?\n I would say at the 1 percent and 80 percent of the people are taking the money out, it wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore. But if I can give another statistic that might be helpful in thinking about this. 18 percent of the participants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age of 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.\n What percent?\n 18 percent in one of the surveys. And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt under the bankruptcy  \n Well, they're taking out loans against it. They're   they're not withdrawing the money.\n Well, but the loans because   for example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially as close to taking out the money as you can get.\n I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first. How   how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language? If the   if your clients can take the money   just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why is it on account of age?\n It   it's not the   if you look at the statute   and let me just work my way through it with you. It's the right to a payment under a stock bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account of illness. And the question is what does on account of modify there. I think the most natural and sensible reading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a plan that is because of disability, and the like.\n So you say that payment doesn't   on account of doesn't modify payment.\n I don't   I don't think you need to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading here, especially given that the statute  \n Well, I   I think the logical reading is that it   it modifies payment.\n Well, I   I'm not sure that it does, but even if it did, Your Honor  \n Holistic for me. What   what does it   what does it modify? I mean, if you had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?\n Well, this is again   I know you dissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously crafted statute.\n No. I thought I was being holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth. (Laughter.)\n Okay. Okay.\n But  \n Well  \n   but what does on account of modify?\n I think what on account of modifies here is the kind of plan out of which the payment is coming.\n Where   where is that noun?\n There are a variety of plans, stock bonus, pension  \n The right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension  \n Yes.\n   profit sharing, annuity, or similar plan or   or contract. It's a plan on account of illness, an annuity?\n Plans  \n Why   why isn't it a right on account of?\n It's the right on account of.\n Well, I think you can read it either way and you'll get to exactly the same result. So let me read it the way that you've been reading it, which is if you want to protect the ability of people who have IRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to protect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for them to exercise their right to withdraw on account of age.\n Yes, but   but there still is a right to take payments at any time.\n Justice   Justice Kennedy, we don't believe  \n So   so then you're   you're  \n   that that's actually a right.\n Under that, you're giving the   the language that follows it no meaning.\n No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's entitled to exemption.\n But as purely English   as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is that right? The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age. That's the   a plan. That's the right. Now, your argument, I take it, was   is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age. So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.\n That's correct.\n It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty. And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered? And the language doesn't answer it. So  \n But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.\n Yes.\n No.\n No, because the savings account doesn't have   I mean, the savings account doesn't have the   the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got to read the right as meaning a right without penalty, because if you don't read it that way, then every one of these other retirement instruments is likewise going to fail? Isn't that your   your strong point?\n That's your strong point.\n That's correct. That's   that's our strong point and we're sticking with it. (Laughter.)\n Right. Right   it's not a right if you have to pay a penalty for it.\n That's correct. It's not a right, as we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk because if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.\n Right.\n And I think no matter how  \n That's a good argument. I like that.\n Thank you. (Laughter.)\n No matter how you read the statute, it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not cover many of the other  \n Why didn't Congress just put in IRA's along with the other things?\n They did, Justice Ginsburg. They did in the last line of the statute.\n Yes, but that's sort of an oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put it together with the other string of plans?\n Well, my best guess as to why they didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they stuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.\n What  \n What your   what your opponents say is that the   the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until   until you reach a certain age. And if they're structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to mention 408 in the   in the exceptions. What's wrong with that argument?\n Well, what's wrong with that, Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early withdrawal. So under their theory, there has   there is not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in the United States  \n Well  \n   that had that inability to take the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a half.\n Do   do we know that? I mean, couldn't someone   I   I don't think this is a very plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want the IRA to be, in   in effect, like an irrevocable trust in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create an IRA that would be as restricted as   as the circuit suggested it might be?\n I don't necessarily think so for the following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products. They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people buy. People don't usually negotiate the terms. If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's the second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax code. You then lose the ability to deduct the contributions going in. You then lose the ability to defer the payments on the income as it accrues in the account. Now, to answer the last part of your question, one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5 to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors. Why do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's are a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.\n And some don't. And the   and the State systems vary.\n That's correct, but only four States offer no protection to IRA's from creditors as opposed to  \n As opposed to how many who do?\n 46 States offer some kind of protection. 23 States protect them without limit in bankruptcy and out. 6 of them protect them inside of bankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as the amount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor's support.\n Well, that's what   with the purpose that we're talking about now  \n That's correct.\n   if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.\n No. No. 23 of them would protect all IRA's. 6 would protect all IRA's if the money in them is necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6 more would protect all the money in an IRA as long as it was deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all IRA's up to a dollar amount. In Nevada, the dollar amount is $500,000. 8 States use, as their State exemption law, an IRA that   a statute that has exactly the same language as the Federal statute. 6 of those State statutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to protect IRA's.\n But here there was no choice of picking up on the State?\n There's a   there's a weird anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means that you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person in Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his   in his IRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than electing the State exemptions.\n And one train that we didn't finish before. You were explaining that in this case the entire $55,000   that entire sum would be needed   would be necessary for the support of the debtors.\n That's correct. The bankruptcy court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't come within the meaning of section 522.\n But you   that was your claim, and I  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n How did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?\n Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an annuity that, I would guess   you know, I   I hate to do math in my head like this. I'd guess it would throw off a couple of hundred dollars a month in additional income. And so if you ask will the Rouseys need that money for their support, I think the answer is yes because their only other support  \n Well. Oh, yes.\n   is Social Security and a $2,000 a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and against which their Social Security will be offset. So when they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about to be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan reduces their benefits. So if the Rouseys are to have an old age in which they can afford to live in any kind of reasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.\n May I go back and just nail down one lose end in   in an answer that you   you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only no statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that you can make your IRA terms more restrictive without jeopardizing your qualification.\n I was unable to find one, Your Honor.\n Okay.\n I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Why didn't the Government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an amicus brief here from the Government, do we?\n I   no, we do not have one, and I don't  \n The Government has no position on the matter.\n Well, I   I don't think they've taken a position here. I will say that in Patterson against Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in their brief, I believe, as pension plans under section 408.\n There   they never go bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against any exemption from the   (Laughter.)\n Well   well, that's correct. The United States trustee may have wanted them to   I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Ms. McKiever.\n Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment is not exempt unless two requirements are met. First, the right to receive the payment must be on account of illness, disability, death, age or length of service, and the right must come from a specified similar plan or contract. Because neither of those elements is satisfied in this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.\n Is it   is it the case that other plans that are clearly covered by the text of this statute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?\n Yes and no, and let me explain that. Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain factors. Those are enumerated based   based upon each individual plan. However, they do not permit withdrawals for any reason at any time for any purpose.\n Not a single one of them.\n Not a single one of them. Now, of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none of the plans that I have ever seen, as the specified plans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.\n And you'd say that if one of them did, it would also not be covered.\n That's correct. It   it is thought  \n What   what  \n I take it   in   in answering Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that none of the   we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as   as restricted as the language in this   this statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a   in a very literal way.\n There are  \n In other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as   as you say the   the 401   the   the IRA is.\n That   that is correct. The   there probably are plans out there   once again, there are so many plans. And those are created by financial institutions, by employers, by different entities. So therefore there are thousands of variations of those.\n Now, why? Okay. Once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you. So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of holistic. So   so the   the point that I would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as pensions   I do. I think of it that way. I don't know much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?\n This is different because this is the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at any time for any purpose. It is also  \n I know that, but   but   and you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.\n That's correct.\n But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.\n Because the right to   to receive the payment, the right to access the money at any time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it does not meet the language of the statute. The statute very specifically  \n No, no. I   you've missed my point and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my following up. I shouldn't have.\n I'm sorry. Yes.\n My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.\n Because there is no causal connection between any of the factors that are enumerated in the statute and the right to receive the money. And that is  \n I  \n May I ask this question? Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an absolute prohibition, would you agree   on getting the money before you're 59 and a half, would then that qualify?\n Absolutely, yes, it would.\n Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?\n Clearly, there's a point at which it would qualify as a prohibition more than just  \n And what is it that makes it a prohibition? Is it   is it because the purpose is to deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically unacceptable? What   what is the reason for drawing the line somewhere above 10 percent?\n The reason for drawing the line is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated in   in the Huebner case, it   it said that it's a minimal penalty. However, there is still the unfettered access that's available.\n But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?\n I would assume as a disincentive to   to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition, such as the   the parking  \n But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.\n It would not be a prohibition, but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10 percent.\n So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.\n Clearly that   it's a very difficult line to draw. I   I can't make that call at this moment, but  \n It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right. But the fact that for a   an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are   you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.\n But the   the hallmark difference here is that it   it is the only type of account that you can access paying the penalty for any reason  \n I assume  \n   regardless of the specified reason.\n   that   that your answer to Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose of the statute is to make sure that people have money for their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any reason whatever, there is no security that that money will be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the reasons to sickness and   and a certain other number of emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for the retirement are much higher.\n Well, that   that's  \n Isn't that the answer?\n But if that's the answer, excellent. So now we have   (Laughter.)\n   let's say  \n Thank you, Justice Scalia.\n Let's try   let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money. Now, would   that you would say would fall within this.\n Yes.\n Fine, yes.\n Yes.\n Okay. Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old age   why isn't that just as good as the million percent tax in a world that is imperfect?\n Because clearly the   the access of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement, just as   as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the   the debtors to   to access freely for any purpose, clearly not showing that   that it would be for retirement purposes.\n But attachment of the  \n All right, but it's acquired. Say   say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60   it's not that bad   (Laughter.)\n 93.\n If   if that is going to be your criterion, the   the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why   why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future? Because the   the question then is going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to old age to   to allow for a continued exemption and how free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA category. You told us a few moments ago   and I'm sure you   you were right   that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up. So if   if we say that the   the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans. Aren't we?\n Not necessarily. The   the line that we're really looking to is that there has to be a direct causation factor between one of the five specified factors such as on   on account of factors, age, disability, death, length of service, and the right to receive the payment.\n Well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that. I mean, you   we would just have endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what doesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to draw here.\n Well  \n And every plan that I know of allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.\n And that's typically  \n In fact, that's what happened to these people. So I just don't see how your argument is going to  \n Well, the   the ability to access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do with the length of service, the years in service because they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full percentage. They're not fully vested until that time. Also, with the   when there are multiple factors existing in the right to receive the payments, each multiple factor can be a cause of the   of the ability to reach the money. When there are no meaningful factors imposed, though  \n Isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support? I mean, that   that seems to me a fall-back position that's provided for in the statute.\n I understand that   that may appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as   taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if it is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts, whether they are truly retirement accounts or   or if they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify under this statute. If   if you want to open it up and   and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under 522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on what can be potentially exempt under that statute.\n No. Well, obviously, it's   it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.\n That's correct.\n And it includes IRA's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n The section 408 reference is   does not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is a further condition to place on the   the exemption. First of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum requirements for an IRA to qualify as a   as a tax-favored plan. That  \n Ms.   Ms. Karlan says she doesn't know of any   of any IRA that did place a   a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the exemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that   that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?\n Absolutely. Those are customizable plans. Any person can go into  \n They can, but do   do you know that there's   there's one out there? I don't know  \n I   I do know of several out there.\n You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you? (Laughter.)\n I did not create one for this case. No, I did not. But they   they definitely exist. In fact, in the Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected that she would only receive periodic payments based upon her age, and that was found to be exempt by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel because that qualified. The payments were based upon her age, and it was then a similar plan because she could not access the funds at any time but only for the specified reason such as age.\n Was that   was that an IRA that she had? It was an IRA?\n My understanding is, yes, it was under section 408(b) was   that's my understanding based upon that case.\n Let me   let me ask you. Maybe this is irrelevant, but were   were these restrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is no, why would anyone so restrict his   his IRA?\n I   I do not know if that one specifically was, but no. These have not been set up through  \n But why   why would anyone do that? They're   they're qualified without these restrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his   his rights to   to withdraw?\n Clearly to protect the money potentially for retirement and   and just as  \n In other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?\n That's  \n I   I want to make it tough so that I   I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the motivation?\n Well, that would potentially be a motivation because clearly the money is there readily accessible at any time to   to buy anything that the debtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 30 or 40 years old can liquidate their   their IRA account, whereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't have that kind of access  \n Should we put any weight on the title, on the name? I mean, I   I can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress trying to fool people? (Laughter.)\n Was the Federal Trade Commission? Should they investigate? What   I mean, the   the   I think of it as an account that's basically aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at retirement, which has usually to do with age.\n Well, the   the name is clearly not determinative. Also, Congress in the   in the  \n I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any   I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any indication, when people passed this, that they didn't think they would be? Any   any reference in the terrible words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?\n Yes. First of all, Congress did historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status overall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account is set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e)   522(d)(10)(e) requirements that   that are much more stringent in the requirements of the traditional IRA.\n Well, are they? Because there was one statement   I think it was in Ms. Karlan's brief   that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as long as you're willing to pay the penalty.\n That's a misnomer that that's a   a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow as a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to payment. They have the right to borrow the funds. However   for example, in the New York Police Department pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their pension plan funds. However, they   as long as they're employed there, they have to continue to repay that.\n What   what if they don't repay it? What's the sanction?\n There is a 10 percent penalty. However, as the bankruptcy  \n But what   where   where would the   where would the principal repayment come from? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the balance was from the   the person's account.\n That would be correct.\n I mean, we call it   the   the loan feature then boils down to a   a withdrawal subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the plan.\n Plus 10 percent you say.\n That's correct. However  \n So it's just   just like an IRA.\n But   but this is in the bankruptcy context, which makes it completely different. The bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a picture in time. At the time that the debtor files the bankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the debtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor has at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-year look-back period. But because it's a picture in time, it's what the   the debtor can reach is what the   the bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that   that the debtor owns. This is very different than the pension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have   have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there, would be present at the retirement. But because they could have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the ability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially reach. There are other exemptions, of course, set forth in   in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry, but the assets that are not exempt are readily available to repay creditors, for   for the benefit of the creditors. Therefore, that   that makes it significantly  \n Subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?\n That's correct. That's correct.\n The   the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view.\n That's correct. Yes, they do. They do. Additionally, the petitioners' IRA's are   by allowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the other plans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much more like a savings account. It's not any form of deferred compensation. They can't look to that to fill a salary void after they retire because the money may not be there. Unlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, they could have liquidated those funds prior to their reaching any age or any illness that   that may befall them.\n But there   there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.\n That's correct. That is correct. That is correct. But the   the key here  \n Let me just get   get straight what   what the   what the universe of plans we have in front of us here. Do you assert that there are no other plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?\n That's correct. None of the specified plans listed, the   the ones enumerated.\n Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.\n That's correct.\n None of them is like that.\n None of them is like that. They all have specific factors. There has to be a causal connection between the ability to access the money. Additionally, it's very important that   that an account or plan that qualifies under the statute   it has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. And there's no question that there are definitely IRA's that   that could and do qualify for this exemption. It is, instead, that  \n Do   do you disagree with Ms. Karlan that this is   this is a standardized product so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the standard product.\n That's not   that's not correct. There are many customizable products that are   are out there. In fact, for example, when employers set up different kinds of plans for their employees, they go and they can choose from many different options. For example, they can choose if they even have a   a loan provision built into a   a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the IRA. They   they can be customized because section 408 only sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify for tax-favored status. That   that is an Internal Revenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit additional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it allows the   the individual or the employer because some   there are two different types of IRA's that can be set up by an employer   to go and customize those so that they could potentially meet the statutory requirements.\n These   these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason   what happens if you withdraw for any reason?\n That  \n What is the sanction against   I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for   for a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What   what is the sanction?\n My understanding is that   is that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed by those plans, that that is prohibited. And that   that is similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds in the   she could no longer reach the corpus of the account. The   the lump sum of money was there for her retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the money is not protected at any time. There's no prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds from the account other than the payment of the penalty. But whether an account or plan qualifies under the statute, it   it   you look at the language of the plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument renders the terms of the statute superfluous because, first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans, and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is not based upon any factor other than the   the account holder wanting to withdraw the funds.\n The right to receive 100 percent is   is dependent on a factor, isn't it?\n Yes, it is.\n Yes. At least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.\n That's correct. Unless you have   or another factor such as for education or for a home loan, something like that. There are several different reasons that you can   you can reach the money and not pay a penalty. However, the penalty is not   is not the deciding factor. It's their ability to access the funds at any time that   that makes that a right of payment. It's not a right of payment without a penalty. It's just that the right to payment exists at all times.\n You don't dispute that   that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.\n That   that   that is   appears to be correct. I don't have those exact statistics, but yes, that   that appears to be correct, that they have   that they may not exercise that at   in great numbers. First of all, going back to the causation factor about the   the ability of the debtors to withdraw the funds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 203 North LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean because of, and that   that is a key point here because if the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is not because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case, this Court found that that reading, the because of reading, absolutely applies to this section of the   the Bankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a direct causal connection is required between the right to receive the payment in the on account of requirements. In   in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever between the right to receive the payments and   and any of the factors enumerated in the statute.\n The words, on account of, in this   this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things. You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things. You may get the same amount whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms of the plan are.\n That's correct. There are, of course, always some other factors, such as you have to first deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But once those barriers are passed, then   then the right to receive the payment has to be at least   one of the causes must be one of these factors. And it has to be enumerated in the plan. It cannot be for any reason, but must be an enumerated reason in the plan. And the   with the penalty, only the avoidance of a penalty is based upon the   the age of the debtor or the   or any of the factors. It's   section 522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status or to the right to receive the payment without penalty. It's only the right to receive the payment overall.\n Does your argument draw a ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument prevails, then these other plans would be affected as well.\n Only to the extent that   that they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute. If   if they are available for payment at any time for any reason, then   then they would not qualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're payable for   for one of the factors and that there's a direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and   and the factors, then   then they would qualify for the exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It is just the types that   currently that the petitioners would have or that people would have that would allow the access at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for exemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist, that can exist. It's just that people have set these up from standard plans allowing them access. Whether they access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory requirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can and do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that the petitioners' don't. The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to claim this exemption. The   the debtors knew or   or potentially should have known that   that their IRA's were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time that they filed because of the way that   that these had been construed for a long period of time. So that they could have set up accounts that did qualify for such exemption, but   but they did not restrict their access in that way. Thank you.\n Thank you, Ms. McKiever. Ms. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're not required to use it all.\n I'm going to retire early. (Laughter.)\n The   the first point is that there are two rights under IRA's: the right after age 59 and a half or upon death or disability or illness to withdraw the money without any kind of penalty; and there's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiary right, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to a penalty earlier. The existence of that second entirely subsidiary, almost never used right   and the statistic on this is in the green brief at page 23   means that the real essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age. The second point. As this Court said last year  \n You don't really have a right to receive it on account of age. You have a right to receive it without a penalty on account of age.\n Well, at the age of  \n It isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age. It's the right to receive the money without paying a tax.\n Well, that's a right that's very important because let me give you just a mathematical example of the difference.\n It is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says. The statute says  \n The statute gives that right.\n   the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.\n And you do have that right. You also have another right. But the existence of that second right doesn't negate the first right. The statute doesn't here, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you   a plan is eligible only if you have solely the right to receive on this  \n No, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service. And   and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't   doesn't qualify. I mean, I would think that that's  \n That might be your first thought, but then  \n Or   or at least   at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.\n Oh, but I think even if that were your first thought, you would then get to the implication that many of the Justices have been pressing today, which is the implication of that for all plans is tremendous because all plans give   well, I shouldn't say all plans, but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you early access to your money, and that's valuable to you. That's why in section  \n Is it true that none of them give unfettered access? They're all qualified in some fashion. Do you agree with that?\n Well, the qualification of hardship has been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to buy a house and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You want to sent your kid to school and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You have huge, you know, consumer loans and you could consolidate that? That's a hardship. So it's not as if IRA's operate differently from everything else in the system. That's why  \n Well, yes. You   you don't have to make up a hardship. You just say I want the money. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.\n I think that's  \n I don't even have to lie about the hardship. I mean   (Laughter.)\n I need the money. I don't have the money. That's a hardship. If you   if all you have to say is the magic word hardship, I think that's why we would say IRA's are similar plans or contracts because this Court has made it clear similar is not the same thing as identical. So if similar reasons allow you to withdraw, that's enough. And that's why in section  \n In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?\n As I read the New York City  \n Without any qualification for disability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me the money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan that works like that?\n I don't know, but the New York City Police Department plan appears to work like that. You can take the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.\n Has any judge ever taken the view that   adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that while you can't put the whole IRA   exempt the whole IRA, but you can exempt 10 percent of it?\n Not to my knowledge.\n At least you ought to get that much, it seems to me, under his   his analysis.\n We'd be happier with 10 percent than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that way. The second point is a point that comes out of this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a line that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, which IRA's do. And this may have led to some of the confusion, I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement account. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an individual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you put money into while the money accumulates before you're ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that are customizable. And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at all or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that they would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for a customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible. That's why we think the most sensible reading of the statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them is necessary for the support of the debtor. Thank you.\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is the safety of police officers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in an inherently unsafe situation.\n May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips? Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?\n Well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit because  \n But it wasn't   it wasn't in the questions  \n This Court  \n   on which we granted cert?\n This Court in Procunier treated the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the underlying merits of the case and   and, in fact, skipped over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address the qualified immunity issue. And presumably  \n How   how  \n   the Court could do the same thing here.\n How do we do it? It goes right to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close question as to whether the police did or did not exceed the reasonable bounds   reasonable bounds. Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury verdict against you, and   and then I think, well, yes, but I begin to come   become disturbed if I think of qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So   so having read through the thing, I   I preliminarily start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive force, I mean, given   you know, I'm using that in quotes.\n Right.\n The jury said it was. Who am I to say it wasn't  \n Well, I mean, this   this  \n   in that situation? But qualified immunity. So now, what do I do?\n Well, in the first instance, it's reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here. This Court has already  \n We   don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or  \n With respect to the historical facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you have   that   that's subject to clearly erroneous review. On the issue of whether or not the conduct at issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at least a mixed issue of fact  \n Well, a lot of it may depend on the  \n   and law that this Court has decided as de novo.\n   on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and   and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.\n It   it seems to me that   Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in Michigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law. To be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be   and obviously the officers' position in this case   is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and   and candidly of the other individuals who were being   being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.\n Have you responded to my initial question? Have you said all you want to say about qualified immunity?\n No, Justice O'Connor. My   my basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a   a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and   and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances. So if I   if I cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously I   I hope I can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there   that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.\n Well, what is the   what is the function of a jury in this case? What does the jury verdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we know from the jury verdict. Other   I think what you're saying is that these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a demurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n I   I'm not saying that that would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and   and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the  \n We don't know the fact   what facts were found because all we have is in the jury verdict that this was excessive force. Period. That's all.\n But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg. So the   the facts that you know are the facts as they're described  \n But it's like was  \n   by the respondent's brief.\n   the defendant negligent. Is that more or less a conclusion of law? We don't know in what respect from the jury verdict. And here, were these police officers acting   did they use excessive force.\n Well, we know precisely what they did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the   of the search. We know that. There's no   there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.\n Wasn't there a fact issue as to whether she was handcuffed for   even for a short period after the search had been completed?\n I don't think there is a factual question like that because I don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case. There   there was never an argument made to the jury that this   that this extended beyond the   the period of the end of the search. The argument that was made to the jury was that the search should have   should have been limited to the room where the suspect was   was a resident or that the police should have made a decision somewhere in the   before the end of the 2-hour search that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they were arguing that   that it even went a little further in terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth Amendment violation in its own right.\n But if   but if it made a difference as a matter of law, what   what should we assume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that they found the facts in the way that the   a plaintiff argues them or that you think they are?\n I think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you   and   and the jury determined that there   that it was unreasonable, then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact   that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to whether that's de minimis under the circumstances. But   but I agree. I mean, obviously there is a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean, this Court has already decided that in the Fourth Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.\n Now, in doing it as a matter of law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in this case, if   if I remember correctly, one of the officers testified that had they followed normal protocol, once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the building, the   the main building  \n Well, the   all of the grounds actually.\n Is that the whole compound?\n Yes.\n That   that they would have   they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he wasn't sure why they didn't. We   do we   do we consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as   as to what is or is not excessive?\n I think if this Court could determine that, as a matter of course, the   the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis. That   I think what's important to keep in mind in this context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about four individuals who are being detained under these circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for the police officers under the   under   when trying to decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing. So, you know, is it possible that police procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes that he can take away   you can remove the handcuffs? That may be, although I don't think there's much in the record here to   to reflect that. But what the police said here   and I think it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified that if something had gone wrong, if either a police officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a   in the context of executing the search warrant, the first question that would have been asked is what was the least that could have been done to prevent those injuries from occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite rightly   and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace under the unquestioned command theory of   of law   is that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of a reasonable search, we will make our way through the search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order to minimize the detention and we will eliminate   and I mean, literally eliminate   the entirety of the risk either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.\n Okay. I take it you obviously don't want us to   to come down with a kind of a finicky version of   of excessive force as the touchstone, and I take it you don't want us to come down with simply a blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do anything in   in restraining occupants so long as it is not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a   a statement that would be the kernel of the holding that you want?\n I'm   I'm quite comfortable with the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you   you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in order to  \n But in the facts there, there were no handcuffs. He   he was just detained. So  \n I understand that, and   but my   my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation.\n So   I mean, I don't   would   would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for   for purposes of applying Summers?\n Yes, but it's important to put that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to the   not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant. It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we know that there has either been a crime that's likely to be taking place in the premises. It only   it only extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's only when the search is for contraband, not just for any evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and anybody else who happens to be on site.\n Well, it doesn't   why is contraband magical? Wouldn't   wouldn't your point be when   when the reason they're investigating gives cause to believe that there may be physical danger  \n Justice Scalia  \n   from letting people wander around?\n   absolutely.\n Which is the case with contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons as well.\n I think the important point here is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These are guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more dangerous than any other circumstance the police are likely to confront.\n But would you be happy then with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm Summers and   but Summers said special circumstances or possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case. And the only verdict part that I think we're concerned with here   it was not about four people. It was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena, the jury found that there was a violation of her   of her Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have found   you said   I don't know if you misspoke. You said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it, I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs, both after the time they had secured the place and also after the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.\n Well, it   it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained  \n But, Mr.   Mr.   but may I point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue to the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to release an individual detained in connection with a lawful search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever is sooner.\n Right. That   I understand that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record and it was never argued to the jury that this search   that   that her detention lasted beyond the period of the search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police officers specifically said in his closing argument, there is no issue but that she was released at the time of the   that when   as soon as the search was   was ended, the   the warrant was executed.\n I wonder why the judge gave this instruction then.\n Because   because what he's   well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.\n And why   why there was   there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one. But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page 255 of the joint appendix  \n Yes.\n One question concerns whether the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable? Those two questions   my first is a procedural question. Did counsel for the defendants object to the jury getting   those two questions being submitted to the jury?\n No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't. And   and  \n Well, it seems to me that the judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is whether there was a   a detention, was force greater than was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the duration was longer than reasonable under the circumstances.\n Right. Justice Ginsburg, you have to put that in context. The argument of the plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have ended at either of two points: after they had completely cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at some point after that when they had asked her questions and determined that she had no particular involvement with Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found, was that that was the reasonable break point. Our argument is that's not consistent with the notion of unquestioned command and   and is wrong as a matter of law. And there is no evidence   no evidence. There was no testimony that she was kept for a period beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very important to understand that.\n And you're saying that the   the mere fact that it   it went to the jury, even went to the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we have to listen to what the jury said. Is that   is that  \n Right. If it's wrong as a matter of law, that's   then that's absolutely right. But there was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The only thing he said was, he   he didn't remember. That was   the question was put to the police officer. Was she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it. There's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally made up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of the jury. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n You might save your time. Yes. Mr. Shanmugam.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: When executing a search warrant to investigate a violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate the orderly completion of the search. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the Fourth Amendment. Under the standard for excessive force claims first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers, the degree of force used here was not excessive. The same considerations that justified the detention of the occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use of handcuffs during the detention.\n Then this case should not have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said  \n We  \n   because you   you just said that this   the handcuffs   the circumstances   the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.\n Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. It is our view that as a matter of law, the officers would have been entitled to prevail on the constitutional issue with regard to excessive force. And it's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for summary judgment. They also orally moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence, and that motion was denied. Now, we also believe that the jury, quite frankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by Justice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the jury only received one very general instruction on Summers detentions.\n Well   well, has the   the objection to the instruction been preserved here?\n Perhaps an argument could be made that it's fairly included within the questions presented. There was an objection made at trial and an objection made before the Ninth Circuit as well, but our fundamental position is that the jury was simply given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue. This instruction  \n But on the   on the question whether they preserved the issue, I   I took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question. They did not object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an instruction as such.\n That's correct.\n But they   they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?\n I think that's true. It is true that they didn't object to the specific special verdict set of questions. I think they proposed slightly different language. But ultimately I think our primary submission is that as a matter of law on these facts, no constitutional violation occurred.\n When you   is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the   that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?\n We would concede, I think, Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where there are disputed issues of historical fact. We would submit that there are no relevant  \n Well, but is   is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than   than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?\n Well, there are certain  \n It's historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive. Is that any different from the question as   of was this seizure unreasonable? If you submit the one to the jury, you may as well submit the other.\n Justice Scalia, those facts may be disputed in a particular case. We would submit that they really weren't disputed here, but there may actually be a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used handcuffs and the  \n So when  \n   or no we didn't use handcuffs.\n   when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not.\n We believe that it is  \n It's not a matter of law.\n   a mixed question of fact and law, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially  \n Why   why any more so   why any   any more so than   than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?\n Well, we would submit that it is no different from the question whether officers had probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a question subject to de novo review, over your dissent, admittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their conduct.\n Are   are you saying that the only basis on   on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the   the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?\n We believe that that certainly is the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact  \n Well, I think you have to say that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you know, the handcuffs   the police had a right to do that, but she was held too long, she was   they   they yelled at her, she was taken into a   a place that was uncomfortable. If   if that's true, then we have to sustain the jury verdict.\n I think that the handcuffing was the key factor at trial, and I think that the best evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her excessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not part of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.\n No, no. But the instruction that was given   and one was read that's in the briefs   it seems to me a   a perfectly good instruction.\n I think that that's true, but I think that the instruction didn't really provide any guidance on excessive force specifically. It was really an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the detention more generally, rather than with regard to excessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v. Connor type instruction.\n Well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this   the denial of that instruction here.\n Well, there were objections to the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps an argument could be made   and perhaps Mr. Phillips will make the argument on rebuttal   that it is fairly included within the questions presented.\n I don't know how you can   you can say that the only thing that was before the jury was the handcuff when the   there was evidence that she was treated very roughly in   in the first instance, she was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for her life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the jury was asked to determine.\n Justice Ginsburg, it was the primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were other issues. I think that the other relevant use of force was the initial detention at gunpoint, but   and those   and I would add that those are the two factors on which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's verdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the initial use of force and with regard to the continued use of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support the officers' use of force in both instances.\n But   but may I just ask a sort of very basic question? One of the instructions reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it   if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you telling us that you think the answer to that question is a question of law that the judge should provide rather than the jury?\n Assuming that that instruction is correct   and that might very well be a valid instruction  \n Well, it was correct.\n It may very well be a correct instruction  \n All right.\n   with regard to a challenge to the manner of the detention itself. In that instance, then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I think even then the teaching of Ornelas  \n Then it's not a question of law. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact to the jury?\n It is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is  \n It's a mixed question?\n The jury's job is to   to resolve the underlying factual issues and then  \n Well, I understand the historical fact, but I'm   I'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by the jury or entirely by the judge?\n We believe that that actually is ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of whether or not probable  \n So this instruction should not have been given.\n That's correct  \n I thought your position was that it   it may be submitted to the jury, but that it may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's the way we are able to set standards for later cases.\n I think that's exactly right, and I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas. And it may very well be that a more specific instruction should have been given so as to make clear that the jury had specific issues of historical fact to resolve. But ultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in the sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely the reasons given in Ornelas. And if I could just say a couple words on the substantive issue of excessive force. We believe that in cases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely be allowed to use handcuffs. In this case, I would just add that there were several additional case-specific factors that justified the use of handcuffs. In addition to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two members of a violent gang were living at the house. In addition, the officers had previously visited the house on two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions. And our fundamental problem with the Ninth Circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers in the course of a detention should really stop and investigate whether or not each   each individual that they encounter poses a safety threat. And we believe that that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise. It would effectively divert officers from the primary task at hand and could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather than expediting the completion of the search. And for that reason, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's rule, its substantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.\n How long did it take them to find out whether the   these other dangerous people were there?\n To find out whether?\n Whether the people they were afraid of were   were on the premises?\n Well, you know, I don't know that they ever actually made a   a determination other than that Mr. Romero was not on the premises. I think they figured that out once they had actually identified each of the individuals, which was fairly early on in the detention.\n Thank you. Mr. Hoffman.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Let me start on the issue of   that Mr. Phillips said we made up. Actually we didn't make it up. The claim that Ms. Mena was detained past the time of the search was made throughout the case. If you look at footnote 3 in the Ninth Circuit opinion in 2000, the issue of the length of the detention was a factual issue that precluded summary judgment. Ms. Mena claimed that the detention lasted for 2 to 3 hours. The officers claimed that it lasted 90 minutes. But more than that, the   the jury   the   the special verdict asked the jury to find whether Ms. Mena had been kept for a longer time than reasonable, and in fact, in the closing argument, it was argued that Ms. Mena had been kept beyond the time that the search ended. And not only is there not any   not only is there evidence in the record, there is overwhelming evidence in the record that Ms. Mena was kept for a period of time, at least 30 minutes, give or take, and possibly as long as an hour. And this is not based on Ms. Mena's testimony.\n Do you find that the   that the   do you define the end of the search as before they started videotaping everything they had done?\n Well, they were videotaping during the course of the search. But if I can go through the facts which might clarify things. Officer Muehler, who was the officer in overall charge of the   of the search, testified at trial that the search ended at 8:40 a.m. Officer Brill said a little bit later than that. He tied   but there's a second video. There are two videos. The second video is from 8:50 to 8:57. At the time that the second   the second video started at 8:50, Officer Brill testified that the search was over. The   the evidence log   the last entry on the evidence log is 8:45 in terms of evidence being logged into the   into the case. Officer Brill testified that Ms. Mena was kept for at least 10 or 15 minutes after the end of the second video and her handcuffs were not released until she was brought back around from the   the separate converted garage back into the house and  \n Where   where is that testimony?\n The testimony   Officer Brill's testimony? Is actually   they cite joint appendix number   on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked   they continue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was released? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or 15 minutes after 8:57. In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually consistent with prior testimony by the videographer herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted. The   the point being   and if you take the distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was   was kept in handcuffs at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account. And one of the ironies of the case is that there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search ended. And so while this  \n But not from these premises.\n No. But in fact, this was a   the search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up at his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had   was   was to radio the start of both searches, and so there was  \n But the   the   I thought that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called   that the warrant covered weapons that were there.\n Yes.\n That they were looking for weapons.\n They were looking for a gun.\n They were not looking for a gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?\n Well, I think the  \n Did they have a warrant, a search warrant?\n I think the warrant covered   I think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and   and the   I believe the warrant  \n Well, this was a   this was a pretty extensive search warrant that they had.\n Yes.\n Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the  \n Well, it's the same warrant I believe, Your Honor, in terms of   we don't have   there's not a lot of information in the record about  \n Well, wasn't   I thought that this warrant referred to a particular address, a particular house, not   not any house where one might find Romero.\n No, no, no. It   it referred to the two houses, one on Cimmaron.\n Well, was the other house his mother's house?\n Yes. The location number one is his mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's   and Officer Muehler and this team was in charge of both of these searches pursuant to the same warrant. They had information that   the reason they did that is that they had information that   that he lived in this poorhouse, that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and that he also visited his   his mother from time to time.\n Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and   and the mother   nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this   they knew pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.\n Well, they knew right away.\n Yes. And that's, I guess, your   your point, that the place where the dangerous man was is not  \n I think that that explains one of the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here because they   they knew that at 8:45, at the time that Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the officers were out of the house and   and everything was done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana possession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted garage with her hands behind her back.\n You might be able to keep your verdict, I   I think. But I think the problem here is the Ninth Circuit   you go to the Ninth Circuit and you say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's definition for reasons that you say. And   and the Ninth Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a half pages written the reason that this was unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about her immigration status, which you   I don't think you even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's   that's the bulk of the   of   of   that's the bulk of the analysis. And   and these are the words that I think they're objecting to. And by any standard of reasonableness, Mena was   the   the officers should have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long before the   the   because she wasn't a threat. And that was long before the end of the search. And what their point is on that is, you know, if that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT teams because they can't operate that way. They   they can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual   if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there for the search for a couple of hours, then they release her. Now, that's their argument. So they're objecting not so much to   to the fact they have to pay $30,000   or they may object to that. But they're   they're objecting to the holding of the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again, though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way not to do it. But   but I want to know your view of what I see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong.\n Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd   I'd say that the   the Court could affirm the judgment in this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that we  \n Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.\n And in fact   and I   I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.\n Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications  \n Right.\n   of the Ninth Circuit's analysis  \n Right.\n   not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.\n I think   I think that there   I would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two parts really. On the questioning issue, I would just say that that   that was not an issue that was presented to the jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment violation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the Ninth Circuit. What we did   we did say in our   in our brief to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to   to Summers detention. We did say that.\n Well, we could say is their opinion   that's their opinion. It's beside the point, et cetera.\n Right. So, I mean, I   I think on questioning, you know, we   we haven't been pushing that issue.\n If   if two of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without   to make the judgment without taking those two factors into account?\n Well, I think what   first of all, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on. The jury found that she had been detained longer than was reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This is a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that. And we've argued in our brief that if the Court did something on questioning, it would really be issuing an advisory opinion in this   in this situation. And, you know, we've   we've argued the point and we're prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that question because it's obviously an important question. In our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that that's contested.\n Well  \n I don't  \n   well, it does seem to me that  \n Excuse me.\n It   it does seem   seem to me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on   on this key point of when she had to be released. The officers should have released her when it became clear she posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.\n Well  \n I think that is critical to its holding.\n Well  \n And that implies that they have a   a duty at the outset to determine whether   what her status is rather than to go around looking for guns and   and to secure the premises. That's   that's one of my concerns with that.\n Well, I would have a different position on that. First of all, I think that the judgment can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of this issue because it was a   a jury verdict and   and the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question 5 or 6.\n The   the first ground being? Just an unreasonably long  \n Detained beyond the   the length of the search. And so I think technically the judgment can be affirmed on that ground. But with respect to the handcuffing, the position that we would say is that, first of all, you   you would have to view the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. Now, it's been   there's been a lot of questioning about what that means and what the jury's role is. As we understand it, if Ornelas applies to this decision, which we assume the Court would do   and that is, that you would first have to take the light   all the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, including the possibility that the   the jury rejected as being incredible the statements that the officers made in terms of justification, if there was evidence in the record to show that there was contradicting evidence, which there is in this record. And so the facts that   that the other side has tried to argue are the facts on which you would make that constitutional decision are not the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. In the light most favorable to the verdict, there was   there was lots of planning. There was a tactical plan in writing that the jury got to see, which said that the   the plan here was to go in and make the SWAT entry, to see if there were non-suspects there. They would be patted down, identified, and released. The jury was entitled not to believe the other side's claim that they didn't say when they were going to be released and believed that the plan was to release them as soon as it was ascertained that they did not have the connection in   in the situation. And in fact, there's testimony from the officers that they knew that they weren't gang members and they knew that they weren't connected to the crime. And they were completely cooperative, and they didn't resist arrest and they didn't flee. And Iris Mena is 5 foot 1   5 foot 2 inches, and the jury had a videotape of exactly how they looked. The officers had a total plan. They   they exercised their command of the situation from the beginning. They cleared it. They made sure it was safe. They took people outside through the pouring rain, which actually they say there wasn't evidence about that.\n Medium   medium rain.\n Well, actually at   at joint appendix number 183, Officer Allegra, who was one of the entry team, said it was pouring. So   and in fact, the stipulation of facts said it was heavy. So Iris Mena was being   was being demure when she talked about that. You can even see the rain on the videotape. And so they took her outside. They took all of them outside. They put them in this little room, which is not connected to the house. They had one or two armed officers outside. There was no place for them to go. They couldn't interfere with the facilitation of the search because they were in this room. They couldn't flee because there's only one way out, a door. There were two armed guards there. And   and if all they had to do was sit these four people, who were not connected to any gang activity, as to which they had no suspicion ever developed that they had any connection to Mr. Romero, who had already been arrested at his mom's house  \n They can't have a flat rule that while you're conducting a search, you   you can restrain anybody that you find assuming the search is for a crime that   that involves violence.\n Well, I think that the  \n I don't want to have to make that call all the time, you know.\n Well, but   but officers do make that call all the time. They make it in the context of Terry stops. They make it in the context of lots of Fourth Amendment issues. In Summers   in Summers, the man was detained. In many of the post-Summers cases, including many cited by the other side and the Government, handcuffing is not viewed as routine. Handcuffing is viewed as something that substantially aggravates the nature of the seizure  \n If that's true, is it routine in   I mean, here what sort of pushes the other way on this is this is a dangerous gang. They have lots of weapons and they have previously gone to this house, which I gather   sometimes when I read it, I think it's like a warren of little rooms. On the other hand, maybe it isn't. I haven't seen the house. There are a lot of buildings around, and they think a lot of people here   we don't know who's what, and we make a mistake in this and we're dead. You know, I mean, so that's painting it the other way. But where you have guns and   and houses and gangs and so forth, now that's why they say that it's reasonable in those circumstances to say, when we find someone in the house, we handcuff them through the search. We might let them go earlier, but that's up to us and we don't want the courts second guessing us on that. Now, what's   what's painting it their way, and I'd like you to respond.\n I   I understand that. I guess the   the problem with that is that that means that no matter who they find   and in this case is a good example of it. They were worried that they might find the gang member who had a gun there, and that's what they were looking for. Okay. And so they used the SWAT team. That seems perfectly reasonable that they would use a SWAT team the way they did. And they went in and within literally 4 or 5 minutes, they had   this is a tiny, little house. They had cleared the house. They had figured out all the occupants. They put them in a room completely under their control where they couldn't get away from anything. They knew there were two 40-year-old people, a young hippie, and   and an 18-year-old girl that was 5 foot  \n Did they search that room?\n Yes. They searched that room. So the room was searched before they went there. They searched all the rooms. They searched Ms. Mena's room and found absolutely nothing there. And   and the testimony   and this goes to Justice Souter's question.\n Did they   did they search the individuals too to make sure  \n Yes.\n I assume they did.\n Oh, yes. They   they searched the individuals. They   they   you know, they completely made sure that   that when they put them in that back room, there was nothing in the room. There was nothing on the individuals. There was nothing that   that could cause them danger. And   and the jury, I think, was entitled to   to look at those facts and   and to hear the facts and to see the facts  \n How did the qualified immunity question get resolved here?\n Well, the  \n And what   what role did that play in all of this?\n Well, at the   at the district court level, the   the district court heard a rule 59. But one of the things about this case is it was tried right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got to decide qualified immunity. This was June 2001 actually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether the proper standard of qualified immunity had been applied. The district judge, looking at the facts, found that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the search. The district judge found that. And then in   in the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of these issues. And basically the   the qualified immunity   on the   on the over-detention claim, I think they've conceded that there just isn't any justification for   I mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes. I mean, that   this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is too long on a   on a Terry stop when there's actually reasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her. With respect to the handcuffing issue  \n Is it clear that it was 30?\n Well, I think in viewing the light most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to assume that   that the jury could have found an hour. But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got something that just could not possibly be considered de minimis under any kind of exception. And   and that's why they fought it on the facts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at any point in this. And with respect to handcuffing, I think our position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all, doesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has consistently tried to equate detention with restraint. And I think what   what Summers indicated was that this Court was willing to allow people to be detained during the course of a search for three specific reasons. And when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the justifications, this Court specifically said it was endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be very much different asking someone to sit around  \n Doesn't that just go to the point that it's not clearly established at least?\n Well, no. I   I don't think that is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in   in   Summers doesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks about having to justify force based on a   on a Fourth Amendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the Court, first of all, used the   the analysis that we have argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out in an unreasonable manner.\n Well, but that was ill individual, a single individual  \n Well  \n   unclothed, et cetera  \n No. I   I understand that the facts were more egregious, but the   the Court's analysis for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity standpoint   for a reasonable officer reading that opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One is that the proper analysis to determine whether handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is   is allowed has to be decided under the kinds of justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham analysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of cases that   that allow officers to do that. Lots of lower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out differently depending on the facts and circumstances confronted. The second thing, the   the point about the disabled person and the particular facts made that case particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those were additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit didn't say that the constitutional standard was particularly abusive or egregious. It   it applied traditional Fourth Amendment analysis. And finally and I think very important and not dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is that the Ninth Circuit in   in Franklin rejected a blanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in Portland. The Portland police department had a policy that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search is over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that kind of policy because Summers and   and Graham require it to be individualized justification for that   for an additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's allowed in Summers. And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing to what it   to   to the circumstances in Dunaway, to   to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of the   the issues here. If   if the  \n And what do we do if we think the Ninth Circuit was off base in   in whether Mena could be questioned about her immigration status?\n Well, I   I think that  \n That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.\n Well, it's certainly   it's certainly an alternative ground. It's not   it doesn't affect, I think, our verdict. And so I think what   I mean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as improvidently granted, could say to the court that it   that it should reverse that part of the ruling.\n It might be useful to say they were wrong in  \n Well, that   you   you could say that. I mean, I would   on the merits of the question, I   I would like to   if we were reaching that, I would argue that the Ninth Circuit   that   that there is   there should be a limit on questioning in a   in a Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of Terry analysis that the majority of the   the circuits apply.\n What   what will do if we thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word, disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That   that was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted garage with a bed.\n Well, I mean  \n I mean, I   I thought this woman was standing in   by some grease rack or something and she was  \n She wasn't standing by a grease rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door because the door had basically been obliterated on a very cold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and after   and had been taken through the   the pouring rain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a coat or shoes. And she was made to sit by there and she was very cold and uncomfortable. And she did complain that the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that they were uncomfortable and could they be removed. It's not a garage in   in the way that the vision of it, but also if you look at it, it's   and the   the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of this. You could see that the   the occupants were made to be in a very uncomfortable situation that was unnecessary. And that   that was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly established law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994. I think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994 search. You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-suspect as to whom the   the officers didn't have that   that kind of   of suspicion. And the Fifth Circuit found that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to the officers. So from our standpoint, on the issue of being detained past the time, I think it's just a clear case. I think the other side has conceded that if   if there's this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment has to be affirmed on that basis. On   on the handcuffing issue, we believe the same principle has to apply because the facts have to be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and when you view those facts, I   it   it is   no reasonable officer would believe you could do those things to Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the time. And I think that it would be   what the   what the United States and   and what petitioners' counsel is asking for is really for a radical change of law themselves. We're happy with Summers and Graham and the way that applies, and the   the jury instruction was based on   on Summers and Graham and on Franklin. The language is taken directly from those cases. And   and the   the jury in a case like this   qualified immunity obviously provides some protection for   for officers that when   when a reasonable officer wouldn't know these things. But jury verdicts also play a crucial role in a civil rights case. In this case, a jury of our community found that Iris Mena had been subjected to an abuse of   a specific abuse of authority in being held beyond the time of   of the search, even at a time when the prime target was   was free to go about his business with a citation, and was held in these painful handcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances where, in the totality of the circumstances, she was treated much more harshly than anything this Court, I think, contemplated in the Summers case. And I think that officers know how to   officers know how to handle the Fourth Amendment issues involved in this case. They don't need a special rule because that rule would end up meaning that when you go in and you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody is still going to be subjected to this kind of serious intrusion on their individual liberty. And so we would urge the Court not to go down this new path that the United States and the petitioners are asking and to affirm the judgment because it was based on clearly established principles that this Court and other courts around the country have   have established. Thank you very much.\n Thank you, Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Phillips, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. I want to start with essentially the question that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any individual detainee. Those are rulings that I submit to you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that basis alone. At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact, proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative ground that there were 15 minutes here. The Ninth Circuit expressly never   or didn't expressly but never said one word about a period of time after the search ended in this particular case, and that's not an accident because there is no testimony. The officer said he didn't remember and when asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent with your memory, well, of course, it would. He didn't remember anything. So there's nothing in that evidence, and there's no way   I have looked at that tape. I ask you to look at that tape. I guarantee you there's no way you can draw any inference as to at what point in this process she was released vis-a-vis the end of this particular   this particular search being executed.\n So   so do we have the tape here?\n I assume you have the tape. It's part of the record. It should be in the clerk's office. If you don't have it, I'd be more than happy to send you a copy. The  \n But there was no   there was no objection to that question going to the jury, was the duration unreasonable.\n Of course not, Justice Ginsburg, because the issue before the jury was whether or not the   we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a   a threat. That was  \n But the jury  \n   their theory of the case, and that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have that affirmative obligation.\n But the jury answered the   just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.\n Not of the search. Of her detention.\n Yes.\n Yes, of her detention. And that was based on the jury's determination that we had detained her beyond the period we had done the sweep.\n So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case? In other words, if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district judge that behaved   gave a proper charge, then the Ninth Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with what the district court and the jury decided.\n Well, the   the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should   we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the matter to go back at this point. And   and that is exactly what this Court does in   you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive damages cases. Juries make punitive damages determinations every day and every day courts of appeals and trial judges review those damages awards de novo because they   because the question is not just what are the historical facts   that you give deference to the jury on   but on the fundamental question of what is the rule of law that will govern the police officers in the execution of search warrants in circumstances like this. They need protection, Your Honor. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs with the potential for abuse. And with respect to Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully controlled confines of federally approved research programs.\n Well, Mr. Clement, the   I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.\n Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases. And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy did so, as well.\n Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market. You don't have that here. As I understand it, if California's law applies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use marijuana will be on any interstate market. And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states. So how do you distinguish Morrison? And how do you distinguish Lopez?\n Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana. And, of course, the Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under Schedule I into the national market.\n Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law? I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.\n Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate. And I think Congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.\n Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume   I'm not saying this is   that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had   say they made such findings. Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?\n I think you would say they were irrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because  \n But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?\n Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question   I think that in   obviously, in all of these commerce  \n Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.\n Well, in your hypothetical   and if I could turn to that   I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.\n But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other   in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v. Filburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?\n Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.\n Absolutely.\n And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.\n But that's quite a different rational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me you're not   you're not appealing to the fact that it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce cannot effectively be implemented without this law.\n Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a different regulatory regime. Here, Congress  \n But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory   you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject   substance from being sold or   in interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter   letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.\n Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market   illegal market, albeit   but market in marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So  \n But to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana.\n Well, first of all, Justice Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to  \n Then I'm assuming   my hypothetical is that California could pass a law that would prevent diversions from occurring.\n Well, in the same way that the Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.\n But just  \n I suppose some   one answer to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.\n Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy. And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though it was focused on what was going to be an   both in that case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the entire class of activities. And if I could  \n But, as Justice O'Connor brought out earlier, all those cases   Wickard, Perez   they all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here, we're told this is different, because nobody is buying anything, nobody is selling anything.\n Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce to activity that the Court described as economic, but not commercial. And I think the production and distribution and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.\n But you're   no, I was going to   your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply   simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it. You're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.\n That's exactly right, Justice Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz and Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in particular, only because it, too, involves a non-commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of  \n Well, I do take issue with that. As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a small farmer. A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market. It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market. He used some of it himself, but part of it was commercial. I think Wickard can be distinguished on the facts.\n Well, Justice O'Connor, it could be   I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was   it was only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm. And  \n The other portion is a matter of [inaudible] interstate commerce.\n Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside   to one side all of the grain that was going to go in interstate commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents. This case is only interesting, he said, because it involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm. And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be consumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the record of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue there. And it's important to recognize that the way the Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it applied to the wheat that was used by the family for consumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation. And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not, is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause  \n And is  \n   authority.\n   this a harder or easier case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?\n Well, Justice Kennedy  \n Does this make your case easier, in a sense, or  \n I think it does, Justice Kennedy, because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit something in interstate commerce entirely, and has exercised that power, so it treats something as effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then takes the complementary step, especially in light of the fungibility of the product, and says, \"We're just going to treat this as contraband simpliciter.\" I think that judgement by Congress has a very definite link to interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to regulate interstate commerce. And I do think there's a sense in which when Congress is regulating the price of something, there's certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small producers and for Congress to say, \"Well, we can still have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority of production.\" But with respect to something that's unlawful to have and is   and has very significant risks precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime. It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal in promoting health. And I think the clearest example of that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been available as a Schedule III substance, called  \n But there's  \n   Marinol.\n   but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked. This was the only one that would. And it   Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. But let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a federal prosecution?\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland Cannabis case   and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion   I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available. But I think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled Substances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue. I think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under California law, is that there's a mismatch between what California law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce. Because the California law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines. And so, if Respondents are right on their Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right because their conduct is lawful under state law or because their   that marijuana use is medical. If they're right, then I think their analysis would extend to recreational use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and would extend to every state in the nation, not just  \n Well, I think  \n   those states that made it lawful.\n Doesn't it depend on how you define the \"relevant class of activities\"? Is it the entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular very narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible to define the class narrowly to escape a   the broad argument that you make?\n Well, I don't think that is permissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard  \n So you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.\n Under the Commerce Clause, I   that's exactly right, that would be our position. It is constitutional on its face, and it   and because of that line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of the statute as a whole  \n But, in Morrison, did the Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify Commerce Cause   Clause legislation by using a long but- for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce? I mean, the Court certainly made that statement.\n Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, but  \n Which cuts against what you're saying.\n Well, with respect, I don't think so. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize   thought it very important to emphasize two things: one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second, the Court also made it clear that the regulation that there   there was not essential to the effectiveness of an overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both points, this case is on the constitutional side of the line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.\n The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use   growing for personal use, under prescription  \n I understand that   I understand that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is not also covered. You're talking about  \n Involved economic activity.\n I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic activity. Because what you're talking about here is the possession, the manufacture, the distribution of a valuable commodity for which there is a ready   unfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.\n If we rule for the Respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in California?\n I would be speculating, Justice Kennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think that what   and that, in a sense, is consistent with the government's position, which is to say, when the government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to prohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition actually would force the price up. And there is a sense in which this regulation, although not primarily designed as a price regulation   the Controlled Substance Act, I think, does have the effect of increasing the price for marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the   and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's all consistent with Congress' judgement here. And if I could return for a second to the point about Marinol, what's important there is that the process of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful component, does two things. One, the manufacturing process allows there to be a safe use for one of the components in marijuana. But it also provides an unambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce Clause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to get people to use more healthful substances, and not use things like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is undermined if Congress can't also address that which is more harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable of being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude marijuana is.\n In other words, the statute is   it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.\n Well, I think, in responding to that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government treats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a particular patient; but that's something that this Court, I think, has previously understood, that the federal regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or doctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.\n Right.\n I think that's the import of the Rutherford decision with Laetrile.\n Do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no acceptable medical use? Say they had a   say there was a judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. Would we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the congressional finding or the judicial finding if that happened?\n Well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind. I think the   the judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance without a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a situation in   and your hypothetical might respond to a different statute that raised a harder question, where Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for changing realities. But, here, Congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III. And I think it's wrong to assume that there's any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect of making it easier to prescribe and more available. But I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe medicine  \n Have there  \n   available to patients  \n   have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the FDA?\n There have been a number of those petitions that have been filed. There was one recently rejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999. There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-iteration effort to change the rescheduling that culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s. So there's definitely been these efforts. But on the current state of the   of the record, there just is not a justification for changing the schedule. And I think both of the briefs talked a little bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the medical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for the individual components in marijuana, that smoked   smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as medicine, because   and that's true, I think, for two reasons. One, there's something like 400 different chemical components in crude marijuana that one would smoke, and it's   it just, sort of, belies any logic that all 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude material that somebody could grow in their garden, and actually have people who do this for a living get involved in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial components, and then manufacturing and making that available. The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery device for medicine, I think, is also something that really doesn't have any future as medicine. What does have a future for medicine, of course, is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial component. That's been done with Marinol. It is true that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form that Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing research to try to figure out different ways to deliver that substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of a   and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that there's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it takes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of the substance and the time that it has an effect on the system.\n May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about   it was, sort of, a categoric point   you, in effect, said, \"If this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them.\" Wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them? That in deciding what class you are going to   or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question, \"What good reasons are there to define a subclass this way?\" In this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits   whether you accept the evidence is another thing   but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug. There's no such argument, I would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category. And, for that reason, isn't there a   isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?\n With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' judgement about defining a class of activities  \n That may   oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're   you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage. And I'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-Congress argument.\n Well, Justice Souter, I have no doubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would find it very difficult to police that line over the broad variety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby. With that, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.\n Mr. Barnett.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I have two points to make. First, the class of activities involved in this case are non-economic and wholly intrastate. Second, the federal prohibition of this class of activities it not essential   is not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. If you accept the government's contrary contentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v. Raich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity.\n Well, on your first point, can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that simple possession of that commodity is a form of participation in the market?\n It can be, or it might not be. If you possess an item that came from the market or is going to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of the marketplace. But if you're in possession of an item that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the market   it didn't come from the market and it's not going to the market  \n Well, but it's fungible.\n That   the fungibility issue is in this case, but the   but a   the fact that a good is fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not make the possession of that good an economic activity. Or  \n Well, you know, Congress has applied this theory in other contexts. One is the protection of endangered species. Congress has made it unlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, the mere possession of it, whether you got it through interstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is, \"We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, period.\" Now, are those   are those laws, likewise, unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce power?\n Not if they're an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, unless those activities are reached.\n Well, why is that different from this?\n Because this class of activities   because it's been isolated by the State of California, and is policed by the State of California, so that it's entirely separated from the market  \n Isolated and   I understand that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the medical use of all of the members of the communes.\n That class of activities is not before the Court. That is actually before  \n No, but it's before the Court when you   when you raise the policing of the problem by California, and saying it's not a   it's not a real problem, you brought it before the Court.\n But that class of activities could be   could be   if this Court limits its ruling to the class of activities that is before the Court, that class  \n Which is   which is what?\n Which is  \n An individual grower?\n An individual who is growing it for her   him- or herself, who has   or has a caregiver growing it for her  \n Gee, what basis  \n   for  \n   what basis is there to draw it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we   we could say people whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that would narrow the category, too. But why does   why does that make any sense?\n Justice Scalia, we believe it makes sense because we are talking about a classification of activities that has been identified by the State of California, and which is rational to distinguish from  \n Oh, but California hasn't identified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far as California law is concerned.\n Well, it's not entirely clear whether communes are okay, as far as the California laws are concerned.\n Why wouldn't it be?\n Because if, in fact, commercial activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking place  \n No, no, they're not buying and selling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and selling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with alleged medical needs.\n I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for   an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other   now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X. But if the state says something about the X, then Congress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me to accept, because I don't see   whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and I can't find any support at all for that in any case.\n The support would come from the exception to Lopez and Morrison that the government is urging that the Court adopt, that the Congress can reach non-economic activity that's intrastate, that's wholly intrastate, if doing so is essential to a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut if they can't reach it.\n Well, here, they say   look, I take it you're using this because I was going to ask you. You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect Boston. You know, we can   oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally. You know, I can multiply the examples  \n Well  \n   and you can, too. So you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?\n By saying that it's all going to depend on the regulatory scheme, what the  \n Yeah.\n   purpose of the  \n So now what you're saying is, in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this. That's a task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in my question. [Laughter.]\n But I see it very well. Here is what they say. They say that, \"By the way, a hundred-thousand people using medical marijuana in California will lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And, second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we won't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is medical.' Certificates will circulate on the black market. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does have an impact,\" they say. Now, what's your response?\n Well, you've raised at least two different practical issues. One is the fact   the number of people who are in the class, and the second is the ability to identify whether they properly belong in the class. As for the number of people, we are talking about a very small number of people. They say a hundred-thousand. They get their figures from the National Organization from Reform of Marijuana Laws. Our figures in our brief come from the government. The figures show it's a very small fraction of persons that would be involved. And their argument is basically   and the logic of your hypothetical is premised on   the more people that go into the illicit market, the better for federal drug policy, because that will drive the price up. You have to   what we're take   we're doing is, we're taking people out of the illicit drug market, which then, under your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction   and Justice Kennedy's suggestion   would lead to a reduction in the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite would be, they're   it's good for federal policy to have more people in the illicit drug market, because that's going to drive the price up.\n No, no, we don't want more people  \n Of course not.\n   in the illicit drug market. [Laughter.]\n Of course not.\n And we don't want low prices, either. [Laughter.]\n But the   but the   but the scheme of   but the class of activities that have been authorized by the State of California will take people out of  \n So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to   the way that   you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress. That's what we'd normally say.\n Well  \n And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.\n Well, within this exception   the threshold issue   I do want to make sure that I focus on this   the threshold issue, which is the issue that has occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity here is economic or non-economic. The government claims it's economic, we claim it's non-economic.\n Well, what it is, is, it's non-economic, and it affects the economic.\n Right. So the threshold issue that is   that   upon which Lopez and Morrison terms   turns is whether it's economic or non-economic.\n Well, I should have thought that regular household chores of   say, performed in an earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic   washing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing marijuana isn't?\n If you accept the government's definition of economic, then every   then washing dishes, today, would be economic, and that  \n No, but even  \n   would be within the   within the power of Congress to reach.\n But even if we accept your definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis upon which we ought to make a category decision. You say it's non-economic because one of these people is a   is a self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for nothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given, or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe that, out of   now I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, a hundred-thousand potential users   everybody is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the backyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're going to get it on the street. And once they get it, under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it and use it. But they're going to get it in the street. Why isn't that the sensible assumption?\n Well, they have an   they have a very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because getting it on the street is going to subject them to criminal prosecution, under both California and federal law, as well as the  \n Yeah, but the   it's also the case that approximately 10 percent of the American population is doing that every day, if I accept the figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting prosecuted.\n But we're talking   in that case, we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for recreation. We are talking about a class of people here who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate the law.\n And if I am a sick person, I'm going to say, \"Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, either.\" I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, it seems to me, to avoid the street market.\n The government, in their brief, asserts that the   that the possession statute that currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why they   which is their explanation for why they failed to enforce the possession statute that they say is so essential to the  \n If one  \n   regulatory scheme.\n   if one takes your view, that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state, somebody whose doctor says, \"This person needs marijuana to live,\" but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use Act   it's just as isolated   no purchase, no sale, grown at home, good friend grows it   and yet you say Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief properly.\n Yes, Your   yes, Your Honor, because there's the   that's the second step of the analysis. The first step of the analysis is the economic/non-economic. If you don't   if the Court stops there, then they could also apply in these other states. But then if the Court adopts  \n But if you   if you buy that   so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument, it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate medical use anywhere.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n All right. Now you're going to have some limiting  \n But a limiting principle is the one that I   was identified by the Court in Lopez in which the government is asserting that if it's an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached. And the difference between states in which there is a state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use, is completely different from a practical enforcement standpoint than a state in which there is no differentiation. Just think of the existence, for example, of identification cards, which the State of California is going to be issuing, like driver's license cards.\n Yeah, but it doesn't right now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your view.\n Well, because   but this is the sort of regulation   the sort of effectiveness of the regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact   I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting the State of California to be able to administer its regime. There is no regime in other states to trust, and, therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which the states are not attempting to pursue the health of their citizens   the goal of preserving the health of their citizens this way, that would fall under the exception which this Court suggested in Lopez  \n This is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things that interests me   I guess, on your framework, Lopez should have come out my way. [Laughter.]\n Well  \n It's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.\n Justice Breyer, that's the reason why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it doesn't reach your result. [Laughter.]\n If that exception were treated as broadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent in Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will swallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited to their facts.\n I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to   what I had to say in Lopez to   was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business. So I would have thought, given the   and I believe that, you know   but, I mean   but that was far further than this, which is just direct.\n But this case is completely unlike those cases. This case is completely isolated. In Lopez, that gun probably did come through interstate commerce, not that I believe it should have made any difference, but it probably did. Here, we're talking about substances that don't. So there's just no literal connection between this class of activities and this interstate market.\n Well, we didn't decide that, in Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce. If the statute in question had applied only to guns that had been transported in interstate commerce, the case might have come out differently.\n I   no doubt, Your   I   and I wasn't suggesting otherwise, Justice Scalia. I'm just suggesting that, here, we have   exactly, that if there had been that interstate connection in Lopez, the case might have come out different. There is no interstate connection whatsoever in this class of cases. None. The only way to make it an interstate connection is through some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in which somebody who's doing something over here is going to have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over there. There is no connection.\n Sounds like Wickard to me.\n Well, Wickard, Your Honor  \n I always used to laugh at Wickard, but that's   that's what Wickard said.\n Wickard  \n Had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce.\n Had that case been about eating wheat, that case would never have arisen.\n Well, that's what it was about, as far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure, there were a lot of   there was a lot more use of the wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but it seems to me the analysis of the case said, \"You take it   you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it yourself, you make it unnecessary for your   to buy it in interstate commerce.\"\n It's   the entire analysis   the entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the farms. And by \"home-consumed,\" it did not mean eating at the family   at the family table; it meant feeding to your livestock and then putting it   your livestock  \n Strange phrase, to mean \"feeding to livestock\"?\n But the  \n \"Home-consumed\" is feed it to your pig?\n But, yes, that's exactly what  \n I don't think so.\n   that's exactly what that general term   how that general term was used in this case.\n But what the Court said, I take it   and I have quoted a lot of the language there   it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in   quote, \"though it may not be regarded as commerce\"  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n   end quote, still can be regulated, quote, \"whatever its nature,\" so long as, quote, \"it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.\" Now, that's the language, and I take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.\n With all respect  \n Which is not commerce. Sorry, not commerce.\n With all respect, what   that's   I was about to make that  \n Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce.\n Right. Right. What the Court was using here was the narrower   the traditional definition of \"commerce\" that Justice Thomas has been urging this Court to adopt. And they were saying that, \"We are not going to limit ourselves to that narrow definition of 'commerce.'\" It would include, for example, agriculture and production. That's all going to be reachable, even though it's not commerce, in the traditional sense. But what we would call it today, and I believe what the Court correctly called it, in Lopez, was \"economic activity.\" Production is economic activity. Manufacturing is economic activity. But   it's not commerce, but it's economic activity that can be reached. And that is the activity   that's not only the activity that Farmer Filburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the statute was aimed at. The statute  \n Well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic activity.\n What made it an economic activity in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial enterprise, that it was being used on the farm   not in interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise of the farm.\n Again, I don't think that's   that faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think the opinion covered   including the amount that he consumed himself, and his family consumed.\n The   look, I   for whatever it's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute exempted small commercial farms. People who had backyard gardens weren't even included within the regulatory regime. The regulatory regime was about regulating or stopping or restricting the supply of wheat that got into the market, or that could have  \n Did the opinion make a point of that?\n Pardon me?\n Did the opinion make a point of that?\n It   it was mentioned in the opinion. It was not   it was not a major point of this opinion. But  \n I don't think it was a point of the Court's analysis at all.\n This  \n Could I   could I  \n Could I ask this question. What is your view with respect to the impact of the activities concerned in this case on the interstate market for marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no impact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or decrease the interstate demand? So there are three alternatives. Which is the one we should follow?\n Can I pick \"trivial impact\"? [Laughter.]\n No, but if it   \"trivial impact,\" is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?\n The only effect it could have on the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users from the illicit drug market. And to the extent that they are now in the illicit drug market   and we don't know whether they are or not  \n Well, that would reduce demand and increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way around.\n Well, it would reduce demand and reduce prices, I think. But  \n If you reduce demand, you reduce prices? Are you sure?\n Yes. [Laughter.]\n Oh, you're right. You're right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\n Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes   your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved   if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market. So the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved. You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. Let me ask you a question that would   that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how many people there are in California who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?\n I do not know the answer to that.\n Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?\n It could be, Your Honor, but that also illustrates  \n But if you   if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?\n But whatever   I don't know, because I don't know the number of people using chemotherapy. But whatever the number  \n How many people are there in California? What's the population?\n Thirty-four million.\n Thank you, Justice Kennedy.\n Lots   lots   [Laughter.]\n   lots and lots. They   a hundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy does not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact, if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is enforceable, or not. And the reason   there is reason to assume that   if we ruled your way, that that number would go up. So, if you accept that line of argument, then your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I missing something?\n Well, two things. First of all, whatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people who are sick, who are sick enough to use this. That is not an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example, recreational activity is, where lots of people could just decide to do it. We're talking about people who qualify, on a physician's recommendation, for this particular activity. That will limit the number. But the amount of the people   the effect on commerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn aggregation principle applies to the class of activities in this case, and it does not apply to the class of activities in this case if they are non-economic, as we assert that they are.\n Well   but that is circular reasoning, because the whole   your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are   the numbers are so few   the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-economic.\n Lopez and Morrison stand for the proposition that activities that simply have an effect on the market are not necessary   that does not make them economic. This Court rejected that proposition, that just because an activity has an effect   an economic effect makes the activity, itself, economic. It adopted a principle that's less than  \n Remote, remote, remote economic effect.\n It was inference upon inference upon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.\n But just   just have it   just   whether an activity is economic, you have to look to the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the production of things for sale and exchange, barter. This whole Court's jurisprudence since The New Deal has been premised on the ability to tell the difference between economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty, on the other.\n But your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their   in their supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic premise on which to base constitutional law.\n The premise of our   the premise of our economic claim is the nature of the activity involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of activity it is. The idea   for example, you   prostitution is an economic activity. Marital relations is not an economic activity. We could be talking about virtually the same act. And there is a market overhang for   from private sexual relations to prostitution, but we don't say that because there is a market for prostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in that market is economic. We look at the activities, and we  \n I'd like to ask you one question about the activity  \n Yes.\n   which was brought up before, and I just   I've never understood this. I'm not an expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not. I really don't know. So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, \"FDA, take this off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety.\" The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right into court and say, \"That's an abuse of discretion.\" The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use. So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.\n Well  \n So that's   I just want to know why.\n Well, Your Honor, first of all, that whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of Congress is to reach this activity  \n That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?\n I would  \n If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it.\n   I would simply ask Your Honor to read the amicus brief by Rick Doblin, in which it describes the government's obstruction of scientific research that would establish the safety and efficacy of cannabis by denying supplies of cannabis   of medical   of cannabis for medical experimentation. And then I'd ask Your Honor to read the Institute for Medicine's report, that both the government and I   and we have relied upon in our briefs. There has been no impeachment of this report by the National Academy of Sciences on the medical effect. And what they say is that the   that what information we have is that cannabis does have a substantial medical effect. Smoked cannabis does carry with it harms associated with it, as the   as General Clement correctly pointed out. It does carry with it these ancillary harms. But when people are sick and people are suffering and people are dying, they may be willing to run the risk of these long-term harms in order to get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that cannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. I'd just ask Your Honor to look at that, which is in the record.\n Are prescriptions, under California law, limited only to those people with life-threatening illnesses?\n They are limited to a list of illnesses that are in the statute.\n Some of the illnesses  \n Some of which are life-threatening and some of which are not, Your Honor.\n In one   in one plaintiff's case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening  \n That's correct, Your Honor. She has   she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be controlled by conventional medicines. She's a law-abiding citizen. This goes back to the issue of what the   incentives there are that are created by this. This is a law-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the illicit-drugs market.\n May I just ask you one procedural question?\n Yes.\n And this is   this is a suit for an injunction. And it   basically an injunction against a criminal prosecution.\n And seizure  \n And  \n   of these plants.\n   and there's an old saying, in equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions. So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old saying meant that you have to make your defense in the criminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?\n Well, it is   it is an   we're seeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the statute against these two persons, which includes forfeiture, which has already happened in this case. We've already had Diane Monson's plants seized by the Drug Enforcement Authority. That is not something that we   that we   that has anything to do with criminal prosecution, and yet that puts at risk her supply of medicine, the supply of medicine she needs to get by, to relieve her suffering. I see my time is up. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Barnett. General Clement, you have four minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As I understand Respondents' position, it's effectively that their clients, and clients like them, in their use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically sealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it has no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on the government's overall regulatory regime. And I understand that to be true largely because of state law. And one of the many problems with that mode of analysis is that the state law is not designed only to carve out those transactions that have no effect on interstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory regime. Proposition 215 was not passed as an exercise in cooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make medical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it in interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the marijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether you bought it, whether you grew it yourself. There's a fundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I think, undermines their theory. Now, there's the question now about what kind of impact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme. Now, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from one of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's a hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical users, if their position prevails. Now, obviously, this is all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation, so the numbers may be a bit off. But they suggest that our own government numbers are somehow better, and they cite them on page 18 of the red brief. But the only numbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in the four counties for which there are data, there was   .5 percent of the people use marijuana. Now, if you extend that out statewide to the 34 million people in California, that gives you 170,000 people. So their numbers   using the government numbers actually give you more potentially affected people. I think in trying to figure out how many people would be affected, it's worth considering what medical conditions are covered. And this responds to Justice Kennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or people with terminal cancer? And it's not. And if you want to look at what is covered as a serious medical condition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of the red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it suggests that a serious medical condition   there's a catchall at the end that includes subsection 12   \"Any other chronic or persistent medical system that, if not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety or physical or mental health.\" Now, I think that is an exceedingly broad definition of a serious medical condition for which somebody could be   get a recommendation for marijuana for medical uses. Another point worth considering, in considering the impact on the federal regulatory regime or the effectiveness of California in preventing any diversion, is to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief. One is the People against Wright. There's somebody who's arrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana. They're packaged such that he has one small bag in his pocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his backpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then a pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck. And yet the Appellate Court in California said that he was entitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was for medical use. The fact that he had a scale, and the fact that it was packaged the way it was, could be explained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and that he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off. I think that shows that it's going to be very hard to enforce the regulatory regime. The other case in the reply brief worth mentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case where a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said that it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled Substances Act against a 250-person cooperative. And that just shows that this is not something that will be limited to one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial impact on the government's ability to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Thank you.\n Thank you, General Clement. The case is submitted.\n Good morning. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The injunction in this case violates the most basic principles of the First Amendment. It's a prior restraint. It's a content-based restriction on speech. It's vastly overbroad. It even restricts the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as Petitioner Ruth Craft. The injunction in this case is inconsistent with this country's unique and profound commitment that speech by public officials and public figures be open, robust, and uninhibited. One way in which the injunction is clearly unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit. For example, Ruth Craft is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party to the lawsuit. And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the lawsuit.\n How about you? You're in trouble too, aren't you? (Laughter.)\n Yes, I am, Your Honor. This injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I could be held in contempt of court.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts. I thought that you were not challenging   at least the question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging   the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?\n No, Your Honor. The question presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional. One of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment. All of the statements that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the First Amendment. There is not the requisite actual malice. And so it's our position that the injunction itself is unconstitutional.\n But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.\n Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. It's our position, though, that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of speech.\n But that isn't what you've said in the question presented. Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented? And that would leave the other parts there.\n Well, of course, you're limited to the question presented. Our position, though, is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is unconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by the First Amendment.\n Yes, but you understand Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would affect the first and third parts.\n Well, Your Honor, certainly we believe that the injunction is most clearly unconstitutional in its overbreadth. We believe also and separately the injunction is unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public officials and public figures. But it's also our position that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First Amendment.\n Well, but that doesn't  \n Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?\n No, Your Honor. We don't believe our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran. We believe that all of his speech is just opinion.\n Does he intend to continue making the same comments that he made before?\n His exact words were that perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr. Cochran owes him money.\n All right. Now, let me ask you this. Under your theory, if   if the defendant is judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if the statements are defamatory?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n What is it?\n There is, of course, a remedy. Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There is a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your Honor, there can't be a different rule  \n But if   if the defendant is judgment-proof, what good does that do?\n Your Honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are poor will have injunctions  \n Well   well, your   your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case.\n No, Your Honor, I disagree with that.\n I mean, you   you say he has the remedy of   of counter-speech. We're talking   that's really that doesn't answer the question. The question is, is there anything he can get from the courts other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.\n That's correct, Your Honor. From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a person may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd be collected for the person who gets assets in the future. Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it can't be  \n Well, it   it seems to me that that really avoids the problem   the problem. So suppose we disagree with you about that. Then it's true that there is no   there is no legal remedy that he can get.\n But then, Justice Kennedy, it can't be the rule that poor people have their speech enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in the future.\n Well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and   and people who have money cannot. I mean, that's   that's not a fair rule either.\n No, Your Honor, but that's why there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue a damage judgment. There are many instances in which damage judgments can't be collected.\n It's worthless against a   against a person who has no assets.\n But that's true everywhere in the legal system, Your Honor. And I would also argue here that none of Mr. Tory's statements were defamatory. I would point  \n Now that's another one that is in your brief. You say that these were statements of opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in your question. You   you don't   there were findings made that these statements were defamatory, and your question presented does not seem to me to encompass at all the question whether these statements were defamatory.\n I would disagree, Your Honor. The question presented is whether this injunction, that forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One reason why  \n Not   not this injunction. The question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation   in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation. I   I just don't think it's fairly included within the question.\n Your Honor, what I am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech  \n No, it doesn't. It says whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure violates the First Amendment.\n We would argue  \n There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation. There's nothing in there about that.\n Your Honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And our position is that all of the speech that was expressed in this case is opinion. And it's important  \n All right. Now, if that's so  \n Well   well, there really   there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I   I think we should just proceed on   on some other basis for this argument. We have other questions to discuss.\n Sure. But, Your Honor, I want to just respond to that. The exact statement there was   and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the joint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief. Can a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion. In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling somebody a traitor is opinion.\n All right. That   that   what you've quoted many   much of this I wouldn't repeat in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for   for desisting from that type of activity. All right. Now, those are the findings against you. So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in   with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind. And I want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?\n I would suggest three different ways in which you could write the opinion that distinguished the case. The first is that this injunction is vastly overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the First Amendment. A second way of distinguishing is that defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not permitted in defamation actions. That's quite different than a harassment action. And third, as I've argued, what makes this different is the basis for this injunction is speech protected by the First Amendment. With regard to the findings that you referred to, you mentioned two. The first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor, the only privacy claim in this case was false light invasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when it's based on the same fact. The second basis you pointed  \n Mr. Chemerinsky, this case comes up to us from a California appellate court. Surely they know California law better than we do.\n Yes, Your Honor, but they did not base their decision on the privacy claim because California law is clear that when it's false light invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation action, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School District.\n Well, we're not going to debate among ourselves over what California law is.\n No, Your Honor. All I'm saying is it's important to be clear about what the privacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer, there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions. Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not the privacy claim in this case which was just about false light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted is treated together with defamation.\n Suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house.\n Your Honor, under Frisby v. Schultz, that would be a different situation. Under Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said  \n All right. Well   well, then this   this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the sky is falling and so forth, I   I think we have to be more precise here. I think if it were in front of his house, it would be different. If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages, it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least   I don't know California law   says that you   would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel  \n Well, Your Honor  \n   that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a   of a business?\n Actually, Your Honor, the vast majority of cases have held that you cannot have an injunction for product defamation. And so I think while that's a different and more difficult question, most courts have said no even there. And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never be injunctions. But I am saying that this Court has said there's a very strong and heavy presumption against injunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year history of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld an injunction as a remedy in a defamation action. And, Your Honor  \n Well, if   if this under   the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this   this   your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy. Is there nothing that one can do to stop another from engaging in blackmail?\n Yes, Your Honor, there is. If this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could have filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your Honor, this wasn't extortion.\n What kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction? I mean, why   why do we do this?\n But Your Honor, that's because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are even worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this Court  \n But   but why   is that true in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not sure   I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in the first area, but let's   let's assume the timid person is not sure. So he wants   he wants to get an equitable ruling first, declaratory judgment. He   and he would take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than going to jail.\n But, Your Honor, I'd remind you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader than against limits on criminal penalties.\n I know, but I'm asking you why that   why that should be. If   if you asked a person not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse, having an injunction that you can argue about or going to jail, I   I think they would say that going to jail is worse.\n But, Your Honor, in terms of the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction has always been regarded as worse.\n Always? Do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if   et cetera. I mean, how   how far do you want to push that principle?\n Your Honor, I don't want to push the principle at all to harassment. I believe that injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment actions. I think it is quite important to note that the California harassment statute expressly excludes speech which is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis for harassment. The history of the First Amendment is different. To go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed out  \n Why can't we say that speech that is   is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different? And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not all speech, but only when speech is being used to   to extort money.\n Yes, Your Honor, there can be an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion. There was never the criminal complaint. There was never the civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for extortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section 518, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of property from another with his consent induced by a wrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful use of force or fear. Now, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking  \n Here I think there was   why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that   of that happening?\n Your Honor, this Court is required to do an independent review of the record under Bose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr. Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside. It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage Mr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its protective character simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.\n Mr. Chemerinsky, the district   I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money   a monetary settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And those sound like findings. It's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the   that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.\n But, Your Honor, since this is a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules under the First Amendment for defamation have to apply. Under the rules of the First Amendment for defamation, injunctions are not available to public officials or public figures.\n Well, so this finding   the court shouldn't have made these findings? It was irrelevant?\n Well, Your Honor, I believe that the  \n Was there an objection to the testimony that established this?\n Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory, who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very outset objected that he was being held liable for speech protected by the First Amendment.\n No, but it seems to me   and I think what bothers me is   is what bothers Justice Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten   that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems to me, is   is something that we   we are not here to touch. That's a question of California law. What we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here   that we have a question about the   the breadth of the case we took. But maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities. But I   I think we're not here to decide whether California could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you agree with that?\n No, Your Honor. I certainly agree with the first point. One issue before this Court is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and whose regulated. But as to the second point that you make, this is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public figure.\n Well, it can certainly   the   the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has   has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question. We may   I'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the   the State of   the courts of California should have reached extortion.\n I would disagree in this way, Your Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate court has to do an independent review of the record.\n With respect to the defamation, pure and simple. I agree with you. We   there is a heightened standard of review, but I don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the State courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.\n But, Your Honor, it was not treated here as an action for extortion or harassment  \n I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does not have a civil action for extortion. It provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that State at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?\n Your Honor, I would say the history of the First Amendment is different. A State can create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any defamation case, somebody might plead something about extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be the norm.\n May I ask this   may I ask this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's office?\n No, Your Honor, because the law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy in defamation cases.\n What's the best authority you have for that proposition?\n Near v. Minnesota would be the best authority where this Court said clearly that injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation case.\n Add to Justice Stevens'   add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.\n But, Your Honor, even   yes, Your Honor. But I don't think that changes the hypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.\n Would you add too that he's judgment-proof?\n Well, again, as I said to Justice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that we allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy people.\n You're saying   you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.\n Well, Your Honor, there are other causes of action that may allow that. If it could be  \n So I'm   my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?\n Not in a defamation action, Your Honor.\n That's  \n I  \n   that's not the question.\n But what is your authority for that proposition?\n Well, I would say that the authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has this Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.\n Have we ever set aside an injunction that did that?\n Well, not under those facts.\n Have we done it either way?\n No. That's correct, Your Honor.\n Have we ever   have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?\n I would say yes, extortion for Austin v. Keith. There was speech to pressure, and yet this Court said even though the speech was to pressure, it's still protected by the First Amendment. I'd like to save the rest of the time for rebuttal, if that's permissible.\n Very well, Mr. Chemerinsky.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court: For years, Mr. Tory has relentlessly targeted Johnnie Cochran with a pattern of defamatory speech in a public forum for purpose of causing Mr. Cochran to pay Mr. Tory money in tribute for ceasing from this unprotected activity. He admitted at trial he intended to engage in this conduct. He was doing it just so he could be paid money, and when asked if he would continue to do so, he stated he would.\n Well, do you   do you defend the injunction in its entirety?\n Yes  \n In other words, the   the   Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to   to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was   quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time. With respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?\n Yes. First of all, I don't believe it was directed to a lot of people. As this  \n Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of   of the named party. So, I   I assume that Mr. Cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.\n I believe this Court said in Madsen that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr. Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for other persons who are not before the court. No aider or abetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms. Craft has never been served with this injunction. Only Mr. Tory. So I don't believe  \n Well, let me ask you a law school question. In   given the injunction on its face, with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to speech in a public place?\n I defend the injunction, and respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is conduct that was being enjoined  \n I   I asked you  \n   from the use of unprotected speech.\n   to exclude the   the issue of conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the injunction that enjoins speech by these people, associates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of the injunction for all time, do you defend that injunction?\n Yes, we defend the injunction.\n Let's take specifically the words of the injunction. It's against orally uttering statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements about Cochran.\n Yes.\n You say that someone can be enjoined  \n Based upon the unique facts of this case, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined. I don't say that in the abstract.\n Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all. I   I mean, the   the injunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of being overly broad.\n But in Near, they set forth certain factors, and those factors included that it was not a private redress of private wrongs. The information was of legitimate public concern. Neither of those elements are present in this action.\n You don't know that.\n You don't  \n You don't know what future speech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know, Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San Francisco. That would be a   a question of public concern.\n But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern of continuing, repetitive conduct.\n Well, what   what you're saying is that an   an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no authority for that proposition.\n I'm not suggesting that this injunction is necessarily overboard based upon that proposition because I believe there are  \n But we have just pointed out that it   that it   it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.\n I disagree with that, Justice Kennedy.\n Well, it does on its face. I mean, it is clearly overbroad. Now, what should we do about that?\n Well, if you're asking me, based upon the breadth of the injunction, what I   if   if there was   are you asking me what I would do to modify the injunction? You could merely strike   you could leave intact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections (ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.\n Now, let   let me ask you about that. Let's   let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the Court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute where we have to save the statute. Do we have any obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why   why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?\n Yes. In   in Madsen, Justice Kennedy, you struck   the Court struck certain provisions as being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain intact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this injunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1. The   they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack paragraph 3. They only level their attack at paragraph 2, and paragraph 2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii), would then be limited to the exact conduct in issue, which is picketing.\n So   so if   before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran. All right. That's what it says. Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart, Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television   do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?\n Absolutely not.\n Absolutely not. Because? Because?\n First of all, that's  \n It said the words. They violated the words. It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?\n Because I don't believe that's a public forum.\n Oh, no, no. He does it in a public forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall. (Laughter.)\n And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a public forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?\n Your   Your Honor, I believe there are alternative channels of communication here.\n No. I thought what you were going to say   but you're not. So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.\n Well, I was  \n But, now, you haven't said that. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it. (Laughter.)\n I think I said it when I said there was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under Pittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct that he has engaged in. And that was clearly the purpose of this injunction, Justice Breyer. We know that. And the purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran.\n In more than one case, we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear and not leaving things to the imagination.\n Well, I think this is precise and clear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's very clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive conduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him  \n Well, it's   it's  \n But nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.\n That's right. It's  \n The injunction just speaks for itself. It doesn't say what   doing what you used to do or anything like that.\n The injunction  \n You cannot picket Cochran or Cochran's law firm. Period.\n If we restricted the injunction to specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief, the response will be that he'll come up with five new words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting  \n Well, maybe there are different grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways to draft it that say no picketing. Period.\n Well, there could be no picketing for purposes of   no   which contains defamatory speech for purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But  \n All I'm suggesting is just draft it   just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely. Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.\n Well, I would disagree based upon the prior   continuing course of   of repetitive conduct and the fact that this   over a period 3 years, once a week, this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr. Cochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles Superior Court. And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a public figure actually favors the breadth of this injunction. If this was not a public figure, then the public forum issue would not be as effective. But because Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets protection is in the public forum because this gentleman could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And that is the problem we were contending with in attempting to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet could control Mr. Tory  \n You   you did draft this injunction. It wasn't the   an inspiration from the judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?\n It  \n This   the terms of this injunction.\n Were aided   were aided by my advocacy, Your Honor.\n Aided and abetted.\n Well said, Justice Rehnquist. What I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran would have been faced with   he has no remedy. Injunctive relief is the only remedy. And he would be faced with a multiplicity of actions  \n Why? Why couldn't he just be enjoined from   from similar defamation? I mean, this   this enjoins him from   from true speech. At least he could   he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that, then   then he could be punished.\n I think we would be   that injunction then would be attacked on being vague or ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say. I guarantee you that was  \n Well, if   if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We   we shouldn't have injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.\n No. I think they can be tailored. I just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this   there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in the least restrictive means. I also continue to advance the argument that this   the facts of this case are unique. It's the use of speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This   this conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The conduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is not protected. If that is not protected, then I believe we can craft  \n You can   you can certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll shoot you. But that   this was a far cry from that. In other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and saying give me something. It's denouncing the victim, which gets into free speech here.\n It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist. But what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr. Cochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions other than to draft the injunction in a form that would preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct without regard to whether it was   and to let him know clearly   give him a safe harbor as to what he could and could not say.\n But the injunction isn't limited to the same conduct.\n But I don't think it needs to be because of the pattern and practice that this man has engaged in over 3 years. And if we take the example, which is so he has a change of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr. Cochran and that's become his   and he's going to promote him as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into the court and modify the injunction.\n I thought he lived in L.A. (Laughter.)\n I think he'd like to get him up to San Francisco. (Laughter.)\n He can certainly seek to modify the injunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent letter brief, there's   California doesn't adopt the collateral bar rule. And therefore, he has a check and balance in this case. Under People v. Gonzales, 12 Cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in the State of California. So in the unlikely event that Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one, and two, in the   in the more unlikely event that someone was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging in protected speech, he could contest, under First Amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in the State of California because the collateral bar rule has no impact.\n Well, I'm   I'm baffled by that. What you're saying is that the injunction   we're just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean anything?\n No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all I'm saying is  \n I   I fell off the track here.\n All I'm   all I'm saying is that if the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive your right to contest. You don't have a right to contest the constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be enforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt proceeding. California does not adopt that rule. Therefore, Mr. Tory can always   if he is engaged in protected speech, he can easily contend  \n Oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at   he's at risk of a contempt citation.\n I don't dispute that.\n I mean, his speech is being chilled with   with respect to protected speech.\n But there's nothing unusual  \n So the collateral bar rule doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt citation.\n He's subject to it, but there's a check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the potential remedy for Mr. Cochran   what   what is going to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs? And if we balance that against the   the breadth of this injunction, I think we have to look at   one of the biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.\n But it would be so easy. I mean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.\n That's exactly  \n And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense. It would violate the First Amendment. But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.\n And I have no dispute with that, Justice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for the injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And you could always remand for further proceedings, consistent with any opinion you would write, that the injunction has to be tailored to   to deal with defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with the intent to extort. And I  \n That's what he's arguing. You're   you're conceding that it's overbroad.\n I'm saying if this Court   well, I'm gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's overbroad.\n Ah, you're very perceptive. (Laughter.)\n And having gleaned that perception, I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on paragraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First Amendment issues. And I think it's important to point out that if we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in this day   modern age  \n You're sort of saying the opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away, has it ever been there?\n It's never been there.\n What are we taking away?\n I   I agree it's never   you've never found it there and you've never said it can't be there.\n How does California work in that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of State law boxes, that California seems to have an action. Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind. It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you have defamation accompanied by extortion   call it whatever you want   an injunction is proper in these circumstances. Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking about this beast in California which uses the word defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues   also finds extortion and therefore issues an injunction.\n Yes, I think that you could limit the injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature designed to extort.\n Would   would that make Mr. Cochran happy? What   what's the big deal about extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you think Mr. Cochran would be any   any happier simply because the guy says I'll   hasn't said I'll stop if you pay me $10,000?\n No, and I think that would be subject to the same injunctive relief. I think this case is unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree, Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I think people would start defaming with impunity.\n You've got to give us some line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto extortion is that   that there's reluctance to say you can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now, what   what limitation do you want to place upon the ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation combined with extortion?\n I don't think you need to place a limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory conduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes on of a   of a business that   a startup company. It can't   damages of   for a startup company   they're very difficult to prove.\n But then you run into the public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation action against a public figure, which they want to say this is. You can write all kinds of things about public figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do   is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation action an injunction?\n There's no authority, but there's no authority that says you can't do it. But what I am suggesting is in   is in a pure defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only way to get that posting off the Internet would be to enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the problem. And if it's   even if it's purely defamatory, you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting, similar to   to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude it. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it in the future.\n But you've just said something that I think that's inconsistent with your earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to enjoin the particular placards that were used, the particular words because then there would be other words. So the same question could come up with an Internet posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was posted but anything about this particular individual that might be posted in the future.\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of balancing about the   how narrowly tailored the injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and, you know   and   and in this   and what test we would analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the Ward test. And   and I think that in applying those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific type of speech or   then that   that would be a   a reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of actions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy for that posting or postings of a similar nature. So  \n Now, you   you   to the extent that you're complaining about extortion-like conduct, something else that you drafted   I'm looking at the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have identified all defamatory, including with the false light invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that looks like blackmail.\n If you'd   if I could direct you, Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of conduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the business of professionally extorting monies from innocent persons and business  \n I   I was going to ask you about that. Were there findings to substantiate the allegations?\n Findings to substantiate  \n Specifically about the extorting money from the bank and the oil company.\n No, Justice Kennedy, there were not.\n No findings.\n There was some testimony only on one of those issues, which was the oil company. There was no findings on this issue. But then I would refer you to paragraph (k) which specifically refers to extorting of monies. And also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the trial's transcript, the   the first thing I said is this is speech designed for an improper purpose. It's unprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran. That was the whole theme  \n But what   what I mean is could you have   without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not looking at your particular allegations but how you described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and invasion of privacy.\n I think we could have pled extortion had we chose to. We could have pled inference with advantageous business relations. We probably could have pled California's  \n Does California law require you to label the type of the cause of action or is it notice pleading based on facts?\n Notice pleading based on facts, but we do label the causes of action. The   the point I'm trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled, if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is not protected. And whether we named the cause of action correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money. We attempted to achieve that. We thought we did a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack and I agree is not fairly included within the question which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the underlying finding. But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr. Tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran. He   and   and this is   one point that I want to stress. We don't view this injunction as being violated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went in the newspapers. We don't view those as public forums under the definition that this Court has provided. Those are not public forums. We are not concerned about that. We do not believe that those events will occur. We did not seek to protect them. So we have given Mr. Tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day. And with that, I would submit that while the injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.\n Thank you. Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about how an opinion might be written, and there are three different ways not mutually exclusive. One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad for all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole said a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can go to court and ask for modification of the injunction, but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr. Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets permission. Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go before the media. However, under California law, under Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public forum. A second way the opinion could be written is that this for speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether that's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion claim.\n Yes, but you're asking us now to   the   the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included in the question presented.\n I think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible. But I go on to the third way that the opinion could be written, and that's that injunctions are not permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can have an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a remedy. But those have specific elements that have to be met. Those elements weren't met in this case. History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow injunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either too narrow or too broad. In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by this Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later than that. To approve an injunction in a case like this, even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in defamation cases across the country. No  \n There have been   there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking.\n Yes, Your Honor, and we have no objection to injunctions of that sort. What we object to is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case and an injunction that is directed at speech. That's what the First Amendment prohibits. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.\n"}
