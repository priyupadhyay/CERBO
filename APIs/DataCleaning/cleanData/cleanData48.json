{"argument in Small against the United States ": " Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns whether or not a defendant in a trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements of the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of that affirmative defense. Now, here are four reasons why that should not be the case. In the first place, if that is the case it would render the defense useless, because if there is no likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark infringement? Second --\n You agree with Judge Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it.\n Yes. Secondly, what it does is, is it shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. There's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to prove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a defendant. And then, also there's no reason to prove the fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence of likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of a burden. You have to prove, first of all --\n In this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?\n This was a motion for summary judgement.\n And was there anything in the affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?\n Yeah, actually, the record does contain some references to confusion. The -- in this case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did have some people that actually were confused. And when that happens, you need to look at what is causing the confusion. And essentially --\n Well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any.\n Well, but that's shifting the issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of confusion. However, even if there -- what I'm saying is even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any resulting confusion.\n Well, is it possible that showing consumer confusion could be considered by the court on the issue of what's the fair use? What's fair?\n Well, the thing is, a lot of times when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the confusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements are being met. The confusion does not go to the likelihood of confusion issue; rather, it goes to the individual elements of the fair-use --\n Well, but I'm interested in Justice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only discretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly infringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith assessment? In other words, suppose that it were shown that the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion. Would that --\n Yes -- well, that would show an absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the elements of the fair-use defense.\n Well, so that if you know that there's going to be confusion, there is no good faith? You wouldn't go that far.\n No, I wouldn't go that far. It's a balancing Test and that's why it says \"fairly and in good faith,\" and you have to look at how descriptive the word is, in particular. For instance, if you're using the word \"best\" -- as in \"best buy\" or \"best foods\" -- I mean, best is an extremely descriptive word. So you could go a lot further in claiming, \"Hey, I have the best -- I have the best food,\" or, you know, \"Come to my store. I have the best buy.\" And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one of the risks that --\n Well, is it your position that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? Is that your position?\n No, I wouldn't go that far, because you also have to look at the objective use.\n I would have thought that consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the issue of fairness. Some of the amici take that position, do they not?\n Well, I think -- I was reading the amici brief last night. I think the issue of confusion, as the INTA brief points out, you have to look at whether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not the term is being used as a mark or not. The same evidence that shows confusion can be used to show a likelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the case, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the case of determining whether or not the elements of a fair use defense have been -- have been met.\n What did -- what did the district court do here? Did it grant summary judgement or deny summary judgement?\n The -- well, the district court granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. It found that, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good faith. The Ninth Circuit --\n But the district court -- the district court -- this way -- [Laughter.]\n -- seemed to focus on the use of the word \"micro color,\" just the word. It didn't bring up what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears where \"micro color\" is not simply a word, but it appears in a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the district court said you could use \"micro color\" as you had been using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized 1999 new brochure. So --\n Yes, that is correct. The district court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that use in 1999.\n And it might not have been confusion just by using the word. But when you're using it in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different.\n Well, in the abstract case, it could be. I would argue, though, in this case it's not, because that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. And you -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very bottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup. So --\n Well, that wouldn't relate to the question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate to the reason for which we took this case.\n Correct.\n I mean, maybe the district court misinterpreted or misapplied \"fairly and in good faith\" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I understand it, the only question we have before us is whether the \"fairly and in good faith\" provision is an exception even when there is confusion.\n Yes, I would agree.\n Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.\n Yes, I think --\n So as far as --\n -- I think we're both saying the same thing\n So as far as Justice O'Connor's question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, it's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to that?\n No, I agree.\n No. So your answer to her question is, of course it could be relevant. Let the other side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't have to show that there is no confusion.\n Absolutely.\n That's where we are, is that right?\n That's exactly --\n Okay.\n -- where we are.\n Could you give us a -- I'd be much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily envision a situation where there is confusion but, nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a clear example.\n In my particular case? This --\n No. I mean, make up one --\n Okay.\n -- that's really clear.\n Let's use the words \"best buy.\" Best Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and somebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, \"Mark's, he has the best buy.\" He wants to advertise on radio, \"Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for the best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's,\" and he keeps using those words \"best buy.\"\n I don't think there's any likelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean --\n Well --\n -- what if he just takes out an ad that says, \"Best Buy,\" exclamation point? That would be closer.\n Okay, in that case there would be confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using \"best buy\" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore, he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair use defense. Because a lot of times when confusion comes up, it comes up in the case that --\n I didn't mean to make it that in my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type at the beginning of the piece, \"Best Buy,\" exclamation point. That means it's a trademark?\n Well, it would be evidence that it is a trademark. You have to -- it depends how big the words \"best buy\" were in relation to the word \"Mark's Electronics.\"\n Well, but if you had a -- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, \"Great Sale,\" that surely is not a trademark, just because you have it in boldfaced print.\n I agree, it's not necessarily a trademark. You have to look at the totality of the ad, and you have to look at what the person is trying to use to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the products, or, in this case, the store.\n I suppose if you have a sign that says \"Park `n Fly\" and an arrow, with a capital \"P\" and a capital \"F,\" then it's arguably being used as a trademark.\n Well --\n Whereas, if you say in a brochure, \"Rent a car from us, and park and fly,\" then that's okay. Is that the distinction?\n Yes, but I'd go even further and say that the -- if you had a big sign that said \"Park `n Fly,\" and it's next to an airport, that would not necessarily be a trademark. I mean, if it said, like, \"Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly,\" I would say that's being a descriptive use. But some people may argue differently in that case.\n The Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on the trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive. So this opinion starts out by saying, \"Yes, we know that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is obliged to show likelihood of confusion.\"\n They do it. But then on -- if you look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion, the Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle paragraph, \"As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis only complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood of customer confusion analysis.\" And then they quote from Transgo, and they say -- explain that \"anyone is free to use a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as such use does not result in consumer confusion as to the source of goods.\" In effect, what they're doing is, they're expanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive words. Essentially what they're saying is --\n Well, they go further in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer to a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not available if likelihood of confusion has been shown.\n Right, and that's -- that's where they're negating what they said in the beginning of their opinion.\n They do have one authority for that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think they're right about that.\n Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case.\n But there is a treatise writer who does take the position that if there's confusion, there's no fair-use defense.\n Well, there are other treatise writers -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if -even if there is likelihood of confusion.\n So does the -- what is it -- the unfair competition restatement?\n Yes, that takes a similar position, as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the same time. Again, you have to look at what's causing the confusion. And most often the problem is the confusion is being caused because the person with the words in question is using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion. If -- there's certain -- there's certain -- there's certain terms and words that Congress has said never get trademark protection. Descriptive words, of course, is one of them, in the sense that they can never get trademark protection in their primary descriptive sense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in their secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove secondary meaning.\n But I thought we're dealing with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning would be assumed.\n Yes. In the case of an incontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed; however, that still does not take away the burden of the holder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of confusion. And, second, the trademark protection attaches only to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the primary, descriptive meaning of the words in question. And one other quick example. The laws say you cannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag. Now, we have 12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on their ice cream. There will be confusion there. Someone will say, \"I want the ice cream with the flag on it.\" But they all have a flag on it. That's another example where Congress said, \"We will tolerate confusion.\" Sometimes we tolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so business owners are free to describe their goods to consumers. And, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n Very well, Mr. Machat. Now, Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of a case where there might be confusion, but there would still be a fair use. This Court's decision in William Warner versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that. You had Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold. And this Court held, as a matter of the common law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair, truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result. There are other cases cited in the briefs. Howe Scale is cited in our brief. The Canal Company versus Clark case. The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes its -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly, Justice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to your questions about, what does a fairness component of this test in the statute mean. There is not a general requirement that the -- say, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but the non-trademark holder acts fairly. That's not what Congress said. It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief -- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -- putting that aside, used fairly only to describe the product. That is not some sort of general equitable receptacle for fairness concerns. That focuses on what the defendant did and how they acted in describing. That's not a test of how the public reacted. How did the defendant behave? Which is exactly what William Warner, Canal Company, and Howe Scale also looked at. In common parlance, in a common dictionary meaning, when you talk about fairly describing something, that's not general equity. That is, is it a legitimate, reasonable, proper, objectively apt, and fair way to describe a product. One could reasonably --\n Well, does -- does consumer -- if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?\n Not by itself, no, Justice O'Connor. Congress told us what will defeat the defense, and that is a -- that is a conclusion that the term is being used as a mark. Consumer confusion might be, if you could explain that that demonstrates that it's being used as a mark. It might show that you're not objectively, reasonably, accurately describing your product. If I describe Twinkies as a sugary snack, that's a -- I can fairly describe Twinkies as a sugary snack. I can't fairly describe Twinkies as a healthy food.\n Suppose, in the Coco-quinine case, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine without using the particular term, and then he decides, \"you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm going to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do that just in order to get more customers away from the trademark-holder.\" Is that good faith?\n Yes, because there's nothing, in the marketplace, with wanting to increase your business and to do better and to use descriptive terms descriptively to do that. The good-faith --\n But what --\n -- continued here --\n -- what if he intends to increase his market share precisely by causing the confusion? That would eliminate the good-faith element, wouldn't it?\n The good-faith element is, do I intend -- it depends on what you mean by \"causing confusion.\" If I intend to freeload or ride or exploit the secondary --\n Yeah.\n -- meaning of the term --\n Right.\n -- that's what good faith means in trademark law, generally. It has an established component.\n Right.\n If I intend to do that. But just showing that consumer confusion could result, or that I hope consumers will pause and think about, you know, \"what -- what's in the -- what am I now being offered in the marketplace?\" But I have to -- if I intend to avail myself of the secondary meaning that you've established of the goodwill that you've generated, that's what good faith goes to. But to use fairly to describe is not a general means of just saying --\n May I ask you --\n -- if there's confusion, that's a bad --\n What does the term \"micro color\" describe?\n The term \"micro color\" describes -- this is not my area of expertise, but -- describes, as I understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent make-up process. And the reason it's called \"micro color\" --\n Does it have a meaning in any context other than describing the -- one party's product in this case?\n I wouldn't begin to know whether other professions or occupations use the term \"micro color.\" But my understanding, from the record, is that the color is obvious. That's -- it's different color inks. And the reason that they use the term \"micro\" -- and this is on page, I believe, 98 of the first volume of the joint appendix, is that the molecular size of these inks is very, very fine. It's going into the skin. It's micron-size. And so that's, I think, the -- as suggested by petitioner's client -- that that's the origin of the term \"micro color.\" Now, \"micro\" is a common term that's -- common descriptive term in its own right. It appears in many contexts. Obviously, computers is one that we're all familiar with. Medical devices often will refer to \"micro.\" But \"micro color\" --\n Wasn't there -- wasn't there something to the effect that \"micro pigmentation\" is a synonym in the trade for permanent make-up? It's another name for permanent make-up, and it's -- it has \"micro\" in it, \"micro pigmentation.\"\n That's my understanding, yes.\n \"Micro pigmentation\" sounds awfully close to \"micro color.\"\n \"Micro color,\" yeah. That's my understanding. Again, I don't really want to weigh in on one side of the dispute or the other on the merits of whether \"micro color\" is a generic or a --\n Well, you have to weigh in on it. I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me, if you think that side should win, that the words are being used in a descriptive sense. And if \"micro color\" doesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they associate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you lose.\n But, Justice Scalia, the problem here is that the Ninth Circuit said that what makes them lose is not that they didn't use this fairly to describe their product, or not that they failed to act in good faith, or not that they were using this as a trademark, but that it was a --\n You're right, that's not the issue in the case.\n Right. Right. And my understanding -- again, the record shows that, in fact, the descriptive use of this was conceded in this case, and that's on page 29a of the petition appendix, and also in the joint appendix on 152.\n You're right.\n But, again, our concern is that this statute has to be read with the terms Congress enacted. Congress drew a balance here. Congress struck the balance between allowing -- giving unprecedented protection that this Court recognized in \"Park 'n Fly\" to descriptive terms, but policing the line between the secondary meaning that attaches to descriptive terms and the -- reserving for the marketplace, for competition, the availability of descriptive terms in their original descriptive sense.\n In other words, if you choose to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your chances --\n Exactly.\n -- that that descriptive term will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and cause confusion.\n Exactly.\n And if you don't want confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive.\n That's exactly right. There's a tradeoff. When you pick a descriptive term, you get right up front, right up front, the immediate appeal and resonance of a term to the -- to the consumers. \"Best buy.\" Who wouldn't want the best buy? I want the best buy. \"Chunky\" candy bars. It's going to be easier to break into the marketplace with \"Chunky\" candy bars or \"Almond Joy\" candy bars, because consumers will have a sense of what they're getting, than if you come in with a --\n \"Schwartz,\" \"Schwartz\" candy bars.\n \"Schwartz\" candy bar, \"Kodak,\" I don't know\n It doesn't do anything for you. [Laughter.]\n I don't know why that is, and why would I want to eat it. They're going to have to do more work. But the downside, the tradeoff, is, as you said, Justice Scalia, that you do not get to take those terms out of usage. Trademark law protects usage, not words. And if the usage is descriptive, and it's fair, in the sense that it's reasonable, apt, and accurate, as this Court said in William Warner, Canal Company, Howe Scale, in the unfair-competition sense; and the Kellogg versus National Biscuit Company, the Shredded Wheat case, if it's apt and accurate, that's what \"used fairly\" means. And if its satisfies that objective test, and if it satisfies the subjective good-faith test, and it's not used as a mark, we will tolerate that confusion, because that --\n How do you tell whether it's used as a mark? I mean, is that -- that certainly seems to be central. Is it used as a mark? And if it's used as a mark, then there is a violation.\n The fair-use defense is unavailable if it's used as a mark. There are other --\n Right.\n -- defenses that are available, but the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable. That's correct. The way you prove whether something is used as a mark -- there's, sort of, two ways of getting to that end. When something is used as a mark, that means it is signifying to the origin or source of those goods in the marketplace. It's not just describing it, it's telling you who is making it or who is putting it out on the market.\n So let's go back to the use on the brochure of a logo-like -- I mean, as long as they're using just the word \"micro color,\" I see your position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark. But what about when they use something that looks like a mark?\n Well, there's -- there's going to be difficult questions of proof. Our position is that, by taking a descriptive term, you don't get to consign everybody else to ten point Times New Roman font, and that they can do some colorful display, but not a mark.\n Thank you, Ms. Millett. Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Defendant's - Petitioner's absolute defense is contrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of the fair-use defense of the Lanham Act. In response to Justice Scalia's question about this is the risk that someone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this defense does not apply only to descriptive terms. Under Petitioner's view, this defense would be available to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a mark. Indeed, our mark here is not --\n How can you use a fanciful term descriptively? I mean, I think that's the definition of an arbitrary or fanciful term, that it doesn't mean anything.\n Well, it may mean something in a different context, I think an example you could use would be the arbitrary trademark of \"Apple\" for computers. There could be advertising for Computer Electronics, Incorporated in the fall, when there's the back to school rush, using the term \"Apple\" in a descriptive sense: \"Apples for Teachers,\" you know, the beginning of the year, \"Come to our store.\" So, in reliance on that, you drive two hours because you're the school district director who needs to buy ten new computers to hook into the system. You get there, it turns out they're not Apple Computers.\n No, but do they use the apple as clearly a descriptive term with secondary meaning, that's what gives it protection. But if you have an arbitrary term, as Justice Scalia says, how could that be, how could the defense have any relevance to a fanciful or arbitrary term. And I thought the defense only was relevant when you -- everybody agrees you're talking about descriptive terms?\n No, Your Honor, the Solicitor General does not take that position either, in their brief they recognize that this applies to all level of mark.\n No, but that, all we need to decide this case is to assume that it's descriptive.\n Well, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive, or descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as was pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be found in the English language anywhere, it doesn't describe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests the small nature and the fine lines that are ultimately used when this is applied.\n Let's assume that it was descriptive, would the Ninth Circuit test still apply? That you would have to show absence of confusion before you raised the good faith defense?\n We don't believe that's what the Ninth Circuit test does, this was a summary judgment entered against us when we had introduced --\n Well, would you agree, then, that in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non trademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the fair-use defense without having to show that there's no confusion?\n Yes, we believe it's the plaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion. The point is, under the district court's absolute rule, notwithstanding evidence in this case of actual confusion, indeed, summary judgment was entered against us because the district court took Petitioner's absolute view that there was no relevance whatsoever to likelihood of confusion to the determination of fair use, that's the rule in the Ninth Circuit overall, and that's what needs to be affirmed.\n Now, I'm confused. I thought the question you're supposed to answer, which is in the blue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of confusion. And I guess now you agree the answer to that question is \"no.\" Is that right, you agree with that?\n Yes.\n Now, that's the end of this case, isn't it? That's what we took it to decide, and that's -- you agree with it and they agree with it, so everybody's happy. We don't even have to write an opinion, we can just --\n I believe the Petitioner came up with that formulation because they had taken on the burden because they were the movant on summary judgment. That's where that misnomer came from.\n Did you object to the formulation of the question presented? Here's the question, \"Does the classic fair-use defense to trademark infringement require the party asserting the defense to demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion?\" That's the question. And you say, \"no.\"\n We agree that the plaintiff, it's clear that under - in the Ninth Circuit - the Ninth Circuit pointed out that, Justice Ginsburg quoted before, made clear that the plaintiff does bear the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion.\n Now, suppose you establish it, maybe we can find some differences here, would you also agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show that the confusion, along with possibly other things are such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word, unfairness, or lack of good faith?\n We believe that when Congress --\n You agree with that, or not?\n No, Your Honor, we agree that when Congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms \"used fairly\" to refer to the common law, which included not only the common law of technical trademark, but the common law of unfair competition.\n Good, so now we have something I can disagree with you about. Now, the question would be, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show there's some confusion, which normally there would be, or quite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome their defense that they put here?\n Your Honor, the time that those words were used, the common law, and we respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General's office on the reading of Warner, we'd urge the Court to read that. The reason the Court allowed the use of the term in that case is because they quite clearly said it did not have a secondary meaning. There is no trademark protection for descriptive words with secondary meaning, we are in complete agreement with that. We're dealing with the secondary meaning.\n All right, so now, if we're going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get protection at all, because I was thinking \"micro color,\" well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny, teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color. And when I think of \"micro pigment,\" I think of a farm animal, I think -- I don't know what I think, it's confusing me. So, for an average person, the word \"micro color,\" I thought, \"Gee, that's very descriptive of just what it is, a teeny weenie bit of color.\"\n Well, Your Honor, I would urge you to look at joint appendix pages 137 to 139 where it lists twenty other competitors that sell this very product, they have no cause to use that word. It is not used in the industry as a descriptive term, they're called \"pigment,\" they're called \"ink,\" they're not called \"micro colors,\" that is my client's trademark.\n What's the difference between pigment and color, especially when it's not just \"micro color,\" don't they advertise \"micro color red,\" \"micro color grey,\" so pigment --\n The typical suggestive term, it was created to associate the high quality that my client markets in this product with that term, I want the \"micro color\" pigments, not the other pigments that are sold by --\n But, what about the word, is it -- am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the word, \"micro pigmentation\" is used in the trade as a synonym for permanent makeup?\n That's correct, and oftentimes, trademarks are shortened versions of other terminology. The fact is it is suggestive because \"micro colors\" is the protected trademark here.\n But there is a sense of color in which color is synonymous with pigment. And I assume that's what was accepted here, which leads me to my question, I don't understand why we're having this discussion.\n Exactly.\n Because I thought it was agreed that for purposes of the defense, this was a descriptive use, is that incorrect?\n Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of the defense, it's the other party that has to be using the term differently.\n Well, could you just point to me -- I'm not asking so much about the \"why,\" I just want to know what this case is. Is there someplace in the materials that we've got that indicate that, in fact, you dispute that there is a descriptive use here?\n Yes, footnote 3 of the red brief explains that this purported concession that they discuss about the use of this mark had to do because Justice Ginsburg was distinguishing before, early uses on a bottle, and a flyer, which we dispute occurred, but assuming they occurred, those were descriptive. In 1998 and 1999, Petitioner started using this on their marketing brochures in a very different manner.\n Excuse me, this still goes to the merits of the defense and not to the question presented. The question presented is, descriptive or not descriptive, do you have a defense if it's, if there is consumer confusion? And your position, if you're opposing the question presented, is that if there is consumer confusion, there is no defense. And it's -- I thought that was the only question you were going to discuss here, not in fact whether, if there is such a defense, it has been made out in this case, because these words were or were not descriptive. I mean, that's a --\n Thank you, Your Honor, I'd be happy to discuss that. As I pointed out, it's contrary to the textual language used by the Congress in 1946. They meant \"used fairly\" to mean what the common law meant. The common law prohibited confusing uses of both technical trademarks and trade names. Moreover, Petitioner's interpretation is contrary to the clear focus of the Lanham Act, which is to prevent customer confusion. The whole point is so that you can walk into a store --\n Ms. Brinkmann, may I stop you there, because I thought you have conceded, as I think you must, I thought you conceded quite clearly, I wrote down that you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion. So, if it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the defendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion?\n We don't believe it's the defendant's burden, we believe we -- the district court was correctly reversed by the Ninth Circuit in entering summary judgment against us, notwithstanding the fact that there was dispute regarding likelihood of confusion. And the district court did that, because as I said it was absolutely irrelevant to the determination of used fairly.\n I think this is really quite confusing, Ms. Brinkmann. The question presented, as several people have pointed out, whether the Lanham Act's fair-use defense to trademark infringement requires a party asserting the defense to demonstrate the absence of a likelihood of consumer confusion. Now, do you agree or disagree with that?\n We --\n You can surely answer that, \"we agree,\" or \"we don't agree.\"\n We don't agree. We believe that likelihood of confusion defeats the fair-use defense.\n Okay, okay.\n And we would point out that as a textual argument and the purpose argument --\n May I ask, may I just interrupt, but when would one ever be able to use the defense if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, prima facie case, I assume, includes the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion. So, is there any room for the defense at all?\n As we point out in our brief, Your Honor, we do believe that since the amendment in 1988, this has ultimately become a redundancy, but the plaintiff's burden of showing likelihood of confusion --\n So the answer is no.\n It remains as a Congressional emphasis that even if, in a trademark situation, a use that is not likely to confuse is allowed. That is what, this was a --\n It's allowed without the affirmative defense.\n To understand why this came in, it's important to understand in 1946 this defense applied only to incontestable marks. It did not apply to other registered marks. At that time, incontestable mark holders did not have to prove likelihood of confusion. That incontestable mark was a conclusive evidence of the mark holder's exclusive right to use that mark on the same goods. Same mark, on the same goods that were set forth in the affidavit with the PTO. That was akin to early common law. At that point, the plaintiff could go into court with their incontestable mark, and it was conclusive evidence. So there had to be a safety valve for defendants to be able to say, \"Okay, I know this is an incontestable mark, I know that, and I know I'm using it on the same goods, but notwithstanding, I can use it because I'm using it fairly, I'm not confusing consumers with this. That's what the purpose was. In 19 --\n But are you suggesting, I want to be sure I follow your thinking, are you saying that in, back in those days, somebody with an incontestable mark did not have to prove likelihood of confusion?\n It was presumed by the weight of that, that was the conclusive evidence.\n Because otherwise, wouldn't that defeat the defense, too, then?\n Because the way Congress structured 1115(b), it was conclusive evidence except subject to the seven specific defenses, this was the fourth one.\n No, but you're saying, isn't your answer to Justice Stevens is that it was a rebuttable presumption?\n Yes.\n Yes.\n Yes, I'm sorry, yes. Yes, Your Honor. I would also point out that when Congress amended in 1988, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that they intended to change this and that's what's so fundamental about the position - the district court position. This is a gaping hole in the core purpose of the Lanham Act.\n But suppose IBM had used the word \"computers\" when they were the only company for ten or fifteen years to mark their product. Now, another company comes along and they produce the same thing, they want to use the word \"computer.\" You're saying that that would be the end of it, they couldn't do it?\n Not at all, Your Honor.\n People would be confused. For a while they'll think that \"computer\" refers to IBM, there would be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the product, in fact, at least a very good one.\n Your Honor, if that were the case, it was more than likely, almost certainly be a generic term with no protection.\n Well, at the very beginning, IBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it computer, they could have called it a word processor, they could have called it a \"think faster.\" I don't know what they could have called it, but I mean, you know, they chose the word computer.\n And Congress took that explicitly into account when it allowed any mark to be canceled at any time for genericism. Escalator, aspirin are all examples of your situation. That's exactly what happened, and when they came a generic term, that trademark was canceled and it became used as generic. Congress took that into account.\n So what is this fair-use defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion?\n Since 1988 it's a vestigial reminder of what Congress wanted to make sure was understood in 1946. Even for the strongest, incontestable mark on the same goods, we are still going to always allow uses that are not likely to confuse.\n But we don't usually interpret statutes that way. I mean, you tell us what Congress had in mind, but our best indication of what Congress had in mind is the words of the statute. And the words of the statute make no sense if they say you have to prove confusion and the only -- however, there's a special defense which you have, which turns out to be there's no confusion, that's not a special defense.\n Two points, Your Honor --\n Makes it a meaningless statute, really.\n Two points. Petitioner gives no meaning to words \"used fairly.\" So if a worst statutory construction --\n I thought they did when they outlined to us what it means is you're using it descriptively, and not as a mark.\n Your Honor, those are other terms that are used in the statute, those are separate requirements. There are four requirements in the provision, used not as a mark, used descriptively, used in good faith, and used fairly. They read \"used fairly\" right out of the language.\n Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that several cases say, the key here is, are you using it as a mark. Because that suggests you're trying to pawn off your goods as another's. Are you using it as a mark? Or, are you using it, merely descriptively? I thought use as a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're not using it in good faith.\n No, that is one of the factors in likelihood of confusion, that you can take into account, that there can be non-trademark uses that are confusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full of examples of that. I would like to make one other response to Justice Scalia's point, if I could. Justice Scalia, to the extent that you hold that the fair-use defense no longer prohibits, all uses are likely to confuse as unfair, we would look to the suggestion made by the amici that there is a middle ground that likely to confusion, in any event, cannot be completely irrelevant to the used fairly determination, as Petitioner in the district court would have it. We discuss on page 15 of our brief, for example, the Restatement's position, which we would urge the Court to look to, which is akin to what the amici suggests.\n That may well be, but I don't think that's the question presented here. I mean, we could agree with that, that it's relevant to deciding the defense, and still answer the question presented the way that the Petitioner wants.\n The district court's entry of summary judgment must be reversed, the Ninth Circuit did that because of its total disregard for likely to confusion --\n Well, that may be, but the issue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too far in the other direction and required too much. And all we have to determine is whether there is a per se obligation to prove non-confusion. If we do so, that doesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's position, it simply says that the Ninth Circuit went too far, isn't that correct? I mean, that is what is -- that is the issue before us?\n I think the ruling from this Court would have to be that it's not an absolute defense against likelihood of confusion.\n How about if the ruling were a defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good faith to describe its goods or services is not liable for infringement, even if some residual confusion is likely. That's what the Restatement that you've just been applauding says.\n Yes, and that discussion explains a couple of things. It explains that if there is a likelihood of substantial confusion, that would be the outer limit, ordinarily that would not be a fair use. It also points out that likelihood of confusion is relevant to that determination that Your Honor just described. Yes, we would win under that position, Your Honor, that's absolutely correct, that's the middle ground of the Restatement --\n Well, you would win --\n You'd still have to vacate the judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying that if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of it.\n Well, Your Honor, we would actually urge the Court to affirm the judgment below, in support of we cite cases in our brief, the Meritor case and the Yakima case, in which the judgment of the Ninth Circuit reversing the district court should be affirmed, and there are other holdings of the Ninth Circuit also that are not before the Court that should be affirmed.\n Well, you're urging then that the Ninth Circuit be affirmed on alternate grounds.\n Yes, Your Honor, that's --\n We rarely do that.\n Yes, Your Honor, I understand that, but in this particular situation --\n Why wouldn't we just vacate it, and you have other grounds that the court below didn't address, but why wouldn't, at the very least, we vacate the judgment and send it back?\n We certainly would agree, Your Honor, that if we are then given an opportunity on remand to go back to summary judgment and carry our burden of establishing a likelihood of confusion, but not have it held against us. For example, in the middle ground, to determine what used fairly is, in addition to likelihood of confusion, we would suggest that there are other factors that the Restatement puts forth. For example, whether there is commercial justification for the use. Did we point out, there is no commercial justification, there are twenty other competitors that don't use this terminology.\n They might have been afraid that you'd sue them.\n That's quite a strong mark, Your Honor.\n Ms. Brinkmann, am I right that they were, \"they\" being KP, they were in fact using the word \"micro color\" before you registered your trademark?\n No, we dispute that, Your Honor, they've never produced one bottle from that period. In fact, we introduced four bottles of their --\n But that would be -- that would be a disputed issue of fact.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n And are we making any differentiation at all between the mini color red or whatever, and this logo that appears?\n Yes, all the difference in the world, Your Honor. We maintain that that is a mark use. I mean, the district court rejected that as well, but that is one of the issues where you suggested that courts have resolved these on whether something is used as a mark or not, that is not an easy answer, and that is why it's always part and parcel of the likelihood of confusion. That's the purpose of the Lanham Act, to ensure that when you go into a store, you can buy the products you want. For example, in the health and safety area here, you may be willing to buy a product that costs more money because you know of the quality of them. At the same time, you want to be assured when you go in, because you don't want to buy the one that's recalled all the time, or that has ingredients that cause allergies for you, that's what the Lanham Act is to protect. And it encourages the economic efficiency of the market --\n Your customers are pretty sophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably know this market pretty well.\n That's directly relevant to the likelihood of confusion, Your Honor. In fact, the typical way of proving that when it ultimately goes to trial is through consumer survey. And the law is clear that that survey would not be of the person on the street, it would be of the appropriate purchasers, who are more sophisticated clinicians and cosmetologists. But, Your Honor, even on that situation in this record, we have direct evidence of confusion. It's at joint appendix page 170, Your Honor, it's the declaration of Gloria Torres, where about 1998, 1999, she was one of the people who did sales, and she started getting calls from people wanting products, and it confused her because they weren't on my client's customer list, and also they were citing different prices. It didn't mean anything to her at the time, it turns out this was the confusion because they were actually seeing this new usage on the marketing brochure by KP Permanent.\n Just out of curiosity, it has nothing to do with the case, do they market this product with color charts, just like paint companies do?\n They do, Your Honor, that's absolutely right, color wheels, color -- and also in the micro pigmentation history, it's very important, because even though it's like tattooing, the purpose is absolutely the opposite, it's to hide the color. So mixing of the colors is a critical component of that industry. I want to make another point about the economic efficiency that is furthered by the trademark laws and not allowing likelihood of confusing uses, which is what Congress intended. By allowing purchasers to know that they're getting the product that they want, they're a lot, able to be more efficient in the market --\n I also -- it's very efficient to allow people to communicate, in English.\n Your Honor, there's nothing to prevent that.\n Well, I guess that's the question, because sometimes people -- I have no doubt --\n Your Honor, I don't think there's anything -- the way that Petitioner passed the Lanham Act grossly overstates it. I mean, I would just submit the following list. The only thing that the Lanham -- the Lanham Act does not allow registration of generic brands, as we mentioned before. It allows cancellation of any mark if it becomes generic. It applies only to commercial uses, not usage in ordinary English language, only in connection with the mark. It can only have a valid trademark when it's actively being used, any mark can be canceled or abandoned after three years. It also, of course, only applies when there's likelihood of confusion. Also there is an expert agency that reviews and goes through a process in which there can be oppositions, objections, all of this could be brought up at that point. And also Congress directly addressed anticompetitive interests when it enacted the statute. It, in 1946, enacted B(7) as a defense for antitrust violations. It also reinforced the Justice Department, and the FTC maintains its enforcement authority, and it also had a particular provision that allowed the FTC to go in and cancel registration. I'd also point out --\n What would be a really expert agency, which you referred to as represented by the government here, and it takes the position quite different from yours.\n At this point in time, Your Honor. I would also point out economic efficiency --\n You say at this point in time? Are you suggesting that it took a different position some other time?\n Your Honor, in this case, it -- this mark has been put through becoming to -- but went through all of the procedures that the PTO required. There's no question that this is a valid mark.\n They're not assailing the validity of the mark.\n Nobody is challenging it, it's the fair-use defense.\n Your Honor, no, what I -- the government's position is the same position that, in fact, it urged before Congress in 1946. The Court's opinion in Park 'n Fly makes this clear. They did not want descriptive terms at all protected, even with secondary meaning. And as the Park 'n Fly opinion makes clear, Congress rejected that and struck the balance this way and included all of these other safeguards, not allowing registration of generic marks, always prohibiting uses that are likely to confuse. We would also point out that that encourages economic efficiencies for businesses as well. By being able to benefit from the reputation of your mark, the business invests more. As soon as confusion is allowed, there is a free rider problem, and that competitor is free riding on that investment. And it's a disincentive for further investment and it undermines the quality of the goods, because the only way --\n Certainly the Restatement and the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on this.\n We believe that the Restatement and the amici are very consistent in rejecting Petitioner's position and the district court's position that likelihood of confusion is completely irrelevant. We embrace that, I think that's a consistent position, and that would be the bottom line, I would urge, on this Court, because Petitioner's position in the district court wreaks havoc, truly, with the statutory framework that Congress set up and intended. We believe as a matter of strict statutory construction, that indeed it is now a vestigial provision, the fair-use defense, after the 1988 changes to the inconstestability provision. But if the Court is not going to hold that that fair-use defense prohibits uses that are likely to confuse, we would urge the Court to adopt the Restatement position, that the totality of the circumstances, likelihood of confusion is relevant, we think factors that it's confusing in relationship to a health and safety issue would be relevant, the investment by the mark holder could be relevant. And to the extent the competitor had a commercial justification for it, because it was a term that everyone needed to use, but \"micro colors\" is just not that kind of terminology as the record in this case demonstrates. If there are no further questions, Your Honor.\n Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann. Mr. Machat, you have three minutes remaining.\n Thank you. I'd like to point out that Ms. Brinkmann's reference to the legislative history is incorrect, and I'd just like to refer the Court's attention to my reply brief, pages 14 to 17 where basically it shows that prior to 1988, courts were required to find a likelihood of confusion before finding for the plaintiff on a trademark case. I'd also like to point out that in this particular case, the trademark is not for the word \"micro color,\" the trademark is for the logo mark, and here's some of the confusion. The Respondents were able to obtain a trademark registration for the logo itself, and the strength in the logo itself is not being copied, we're just using the descriptive words within the logo itself. And Congress always intended for descriptive words to be free for everybody to use in their primary descriptive sense, so long as the person, the subsequent user, is not using those descriptive words in the secondary meaning sense, and that's the distinction. The confusion is only an issue to determine whether or not the elements of the fair-use defense is being met, but that confusion should be distinguished from likelihood of confusion. Confusion is a factual determination, likelihood of confusion is a legal determination. So you can use whether or not there is actual confusion to determine whether or not the mark, sorry, the word is being used as a mark.\n I forget your position, if you've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion that is predictable or that is likely is one of the elements that can be used to determine whether the use is a fair one? Do you agree or disagree with that?\n I would agree, the degree of confusion, but that comes into whether or not --\n All right, that's all I wanted to know.\n In this case, \"used fairly\" means, it does mean something, we're saying used fairly refers to whether or not the use is a truthful or reasonably accurate description of the mark. And it always -- truthful is something that the common law always looked at to see, that was a term used, in fact, by this Court in the Warner decision, basically, to quote briefly from that decision, it said \"the use of a similar name by another to truthfully describe the same product does not constitute a legal or moral wrong.\" So I would maintain that \"used fairly\" means truthful, or can determine whether or not it's exactly true, reasonably accurate. And that would be the meaning of \"used fairly.\" And of course, good faith refers to the intent, and there you have the elements of the fair-use defense. Also, I'd just like to point out once again the Ninth Circuit opinion, it says on the bottom of page 17a, it says, \"KP can only benefit from the fair-use defense if there is no likelihood of confusion between KP's use of the term `micro color', and Lasting's mark.\" And then they go on to say, \"as discussed above, because in this case they can be no fair use --\"\n Thank you, Mr. Machat, the case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Though bound by Stanford v. Kentucky, the Missouri Supreme Court rejected both its holding and its rationale. This Court should stay the course it set in Stanford, leaving in the hands of legislators a determination as to the precise minimum age for capital punishment within the realm of Thompson v. Oklahoma, and leaving to jurors responsibility for determining the culpability of individual defendants above that minimum age. The Missouri court justified its departure from Stanford on Atkins v. Virginia, but the result it reached is quite different from the result in Stanford. In that -- excuse me -- in Atkins. In that case, the Court was addressing mental ability, itself a component of culpability. The Court announced a principle based on that characteristic, that is, that the mentally retarded are not to be eligible for capital punishment, but then it left to the States the determination of the standard and the means of implementing that principle. The Missouri Supreme Court, by contrast, jumped beyond the question of maturity, which is an element of culpability analysis, to the arbitrary distinction of age. It drew a line based purely on age, which is necessarily over-inclusive, and then it gave that line constitutional status, thus depriving legislators and juries of the ability to evaluate the maturity of 17-year-old defenders.\n Well, we didn't leave it up to the States entirely. I mean, you -- you mean the States could adopt any definition of mental retardation they want?\n No. The States certainly --\n So there's -- there's some minimal level of mental retardation. Right?\n There is some minimal level.\n And isn't that necessarily over-inclusive, just as picking any single age is necessarily over-inclusive?\n No.\n Surely there will be some people who -- who, although they have that level of mental retardation, with regard to the particular crime in question, are deserving of the death penalty.\n I -- I don't agree that it would be over-inclusive, given the Court's analysis in Atkins. The Court said that someone who has that level of mental retardation is simply not sufficiently culpable by definition. That certainly would not be true here. There are 17-year-olds who are equally culpable with those who are 18, 20, 25, or some other age.\n But the age 18 is set even for such things as buying tobacco. The -- the dividing line between people who are members of the community, the adult community, is pervasively 18, to vote, to sit on juries, to serve in the military. Why should it be that someone is death-eligible under the age of 18 but not eligible to be an adult member of the community?\n I think that legislators would be surprised, when they adopted those statutes, that they were affecting their criminal law. In fact, many of those statutes have individualized determinations, the military being one of them. 17-year-olds can enlist. There is an individualized determination, albeit by parents, not the Government. 17-year-olds may be serving in Iraq today. That -- the other kinds of examples that you cite, for example, tobacco --\n But with parental -- they are wards of their parents.\n Yes.\n So their parents -- the same thing with marriage. A 17-year-old can marry but not without parental consent.\n Although in most instances can marry if they go to a court and demonstrate they are sufficiently mature, again contemplating individualized determination, which the Missouri Supreme Court says does not exist as to 17-year-olds with regard to capital punishment.\n Why pick -- why pick on the death penalty? I mean, if you're going to say that somehow people under 18 are juveniles for all purposes, why -- why just pick on the death penalty? Why -- why not say they're immune from any criminal penalty?\n Well, I -- I must assume that if we -- if the Court says they are immune from the -- from capital punishment that someone will come and say they also must be immune from, for example, life without parole.\n I'm sure that -- I'm sure that would follow. I -- I don't see where there's a logical line.\n No. The -- the problem with adopting the -- the 18-year-old line is that it is essentially arbitrary. It's the kind of line that legislators and not courts adopt.\n But didn't -- didn't we adopt a 16-year-old line in our earlier case?\n In -- in Thompson, the Court in a 4-1-4 decision struck a 15-year-old -- a 15-year-old execution, and the States have taken, including Missouri through its General Assembly, have taken that to mean that there is a 16-year-old line. And today, in fact, I think it's true that there is a consensus nationally with regard to the 16-year-old line, not because it has some biological or psychological magic, but because perhaps --\n Well, but -- but there was -- it's about the same consensus that existed in the retardation case.\n Absolutely, that's true. If you look at the -- the --\n And -- and so are we somehow required to at least look at that? I mean, the statistics of how many States have approved 18 years as the line is about the same as those in the retardation case.\n The -- the Court has kind of three groups of cases with regard to the number of States. On one extreme, are Enmund and Coker where you have three and eight States. On the other extreme, are Penry and Stanford where you have 24 and 34 States. And then there's this middle group, which isn't just Atkins and this case. It's also Tison, which is also almost exactly the same number. The Court in Atkins had to find a way of distinguishing Tison, to the extent the Court relied on that -- that counting process, and the -- the Court concluded that there was kind of an inexorable trend with regard to the mentally retarded. We don't have that kind of trend here. In --\n Well, we -- we have a different kind of trend. What do you make -- you spoke of a consensus, but what do you make of the fact that over the last, I guess, 10- or 12-year period, the actual imposition of the death penalty for -- for those whose crimes were -- were under 18 has -- has steadily been dropping. I think 10 years ago, there were 13. Last year, I -- I think the figures were that there were two. The -- the consensus seems to be eroding, and yet as -- as the counsel on the other side pointed out, this has been occurring at a time when -- when treating juvenile crime seriously has not, in fact, been eroding at all. What -- what are we supposed to make of that?\n Well, two things. Number one is that capital sentences have been dropping for all ages, not just for those under 18. So it -- you have to take that into account. The second is that although the last --\n Has -- has the -- has the rate of attrition been the same?\n It is --\n 13 to 2 is pretty spectacular.\n It is not --\n I don't think we've seen that, or maybe we have seen that, for -- for death imposition generally. Is that so?\n It is certainly greater, but part of the problem is we're dealing with such small numbers for the -- the juveniles, those under 18, that the difference of one or two makes a huge difference in how the numbers come out. But if you look over the last 10 years, in fact, it has gone up and down and currently is in a down trend, but the down trend --\n Well, it went up once I think, didn't it?\n It -- it went up once within -- since -- since Stanford and then came back down. Now, whether this -- this period in which it comes back down is going to remain that way or whether we'll go back up to where we were 10 years ago I don't know. That's entirely hypothetical to suggest that -- that this very recent trend is more dispositive than the trends over the last 10 years.\n So -- so you're basically --\n You're -- you're basically saying that the -- the time is too short, the numbers are too small --\n Right.\n -- to infer anything.\n Right, and the time is too short on the legislative side as well. We're only talking about the States that have adopted new legislation having done so, one of them in 1999 and the others simply in 2002 and 2004. If we were to look at the history of -- of capital punishment in the United States, there are many times when States have abolished capital punishment and then returned. And Justice --\n You -- you were in the midst of telling us why the -- there is a consensus now that it's inappropriate to execute anyone under 16, and I -- I -- you weren't --\n No. It --\n You couldn't finish that answer. I want to know it.\n Since -- since Stanford, we have had no executions under 16 even though it is possible to read Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case as allowing a State to adopt a statute that specifically says 15. No one has tried that. Everyone seems to have taken Thompson and Stanford together to mean there is a 16-year-old line. Two States have adopted 16 by statute.\n And -- and so you say there's -- there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding of what that decision means.\n I -- I think that that's right. There are States that have adopted it specifically and others have simply implemented it. If I were a prosecutor today, I -- it's hard to imagine that I would -- even in a State where I could find a statute saying I could prosecute someone under age 16, that I would try such a thing.\n Let -- let me ask you this. I -- I don't yet have the -- the record showing the full closing argument of -- of both sides, but we do have the portion where the prosecutor says, isn't this scary? Can adolescence ever be anything but mitigating?\n I -- I don't know how it could be anything but mitigating. But what we have in that --\n But that's not how the prosecution presented it to the jury.\n In that statement, but --\n He said -- he -- he almost made it aggravating. Isn't that scary? I don't have the -- I don't have the full argument.\n No. What -- what he's facing is -- is 18 pages of transcript that occupied the -- the defense counsel's argument. Of those 18 pages, 4 pages are dedicated purely to Mr. Simmons' youth, and throughout the rest of the argument, he uses terms to reinforce that. He refers to him repeatedly as a 17-year-old. He calls him a kid. He does things to reinforce with the jury that he's very young. So then we come back and in a few pages of rebuttal, we have a couple of words -- I shouldn't say that -- two sentences in which the prosecutor is trying to respond to that particular lengthy theme and argument.\n It was pretty clear. The -- the words in question were: Think about age. 17 years old. Isn't that scary? Doesn't that scare you? Mitigating? Quite the contrary I submit. Quite the contrary.\n And if we were here because Mr. Simmons said that was improper and the Missouri Supreme Court said that was improper, well, we wouldn't be here. We wouldn't have asked for certiorari. The Court wouldn't have granted it.\n But the question is, can -- is -- is age, youth inevitably mitigating, and here is a prosecutor giving the answer no, it can be aggravating.\n The Missouri statute requires that an instruction be given that says that age is a mitigator, and the -- the instruction was given here. And the jury heard argument concerning that particular claim.\n Well, what's -- what's the --\n Well, that's somewhat --\n What is the contrary of -- of mitigating? I -- I would assume --\n Aggravating, but aggravating --\n Is it? I -- I would assume it's not mitigating.\n Well, you're right, Your Honor, because --\n Maybe the opposite of mitigating is aggravating, but it -- it's perfectly good English to say, mitigating? Quite the contrary --\n It is --\n It's not at all mitigating.\n Yes. And -- and --\n So I don't know why you give that one away.\n Certainly aggravating circumstances are defined in the Missouri statute, and they were defined in the instructions. So this was not to be considered by the jury as an aggravator.\n Let -- let's focus on the word unusual. Forget cruel for the moment, although they're both obviously involved. We've seen very substantial demonstration that world opinion is -- is against this, at least as interpreted by the leaders of the European Union. Does that have a bearing on what's unusual? Suppose it were shown that the United States were one of the very, very few countries that executed juveniles, and that's true. Does that have a bearing on whether or not it's unusual?\n No more than if we were one of the very few countries that didn't do this. It would bear on the question of unusual. The decision as to the Eighth Amendment should not be based on what happens in the rest of the world. It needs to be based on the mores of -- of American society.\n Have the countries of the European Union abolished the death penalty by popular vote?\n I don't know how they've done that, Your Honor.\n I thought they did it by reason of a judgment of a court --\n Well, in fact --\n -- which required all of them to abolish it.\n I -- I believe that --\n And I thought that some of the public opinion polls in -- in a number of the countries support the death penalty.\n I believe that there are countries in Europe who abolish it because of their membership in the European Union --\n I -- I acknowledged that in -- in my question. I recognize it is the leadership in many of these countries that objects to it. But let us -- let us assume that it's an accepted practice in most countries of the world not to execute a juvenile for moral reasons. That has no bearing on whether or not what we're doing is unusual?\n I -- I can't concede that it does because it's unimaginable to me that we would be willing to accept the alternative, the flip side of that argument. It does seem to me, however, that that goes to a particular -- back to the aspect where I began --\n Is there -- is there any on -- on that? Is there any indication? I mean, I've never seen any either way, to tell you the truth, but -- that Madison or Jefferson or whoever, when they were writing the Constitution, would have thought what happened elsewhere, let's say, in Britain or in the British -- they were a British colony. They did think Blackstone was relevant. Did any -- that they would have thought it was totally irrelevant what happened elsewhere in the world to the word unusual. Is there any indication in any debate or any of the ratification conventions?\n Nothing that I have seen has suggested that --\n So if Lincoln --\n -- one way or the other.\n -- Abraham Lincoln used to study Blackstone and I think he thought that the Founding Fathers studied Blackstone, and all that happened in England was relevant, is there some special reason why what happens abroad would not be relevant here? Relevant.\n There's a --\n I'm not saying controlling.\n There's a special reason why Blackstone would be relevant because that was the law from which they were operating when they put this language into the Constitution.\n Absolutely, and they, I guess, were looking at English practices, and would they have thought it was wrong to look abroad as a relevant feature?\n And -- and I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor.\n Do we -- do we ever take the position that what we do here should influence what people think elsewhere?\n I -- I have not seen that overtly in any of the Court's opinions, Your Honor.\n You -- you think --\n You -- you thought that Mr. Jefferson thought that what we did here had no bearing on the rest of the world?\n Oh, I -- I think Mr. Jefferson thought that. I think many of the Founders thought that they were leading the world, and I have no objection to us leading the world, but Mr. Jefferson's lead of the world was through the legislature not through the courts.\n But did he not also say that to -- to lead the world, we would have to show a decent respect for the opinions of mankind?\n That -- that may well be.\n What did John Adams think of the French? (Laughter.)\n I read a biography of John Adams recently. I recall that he didn't think highly of them. (Laughter.)\n The -- Missouri, in order to implement the principle that those who are immature should not be subject to capital punishment, has adopted an approach that, first off, excludes anyone age 16 and under from capital punishment; second, requires certification by the juvenile court for anyone who is 16, but otherwise turns the matter over to the jury and defines it as a statutory mitigator. The kind of evidence that is discussed in Mr. Simmons' brief at some length could have been applied -- could have been presented during the penalty phase of Mr. Simmons' trial. It has been reflected in decisions of this Court as far back as Eddings where there was evidence of mental and emotional development. In Penry, there was evidence of mental age and social maturity. And here, in the post-conviction proceeding, Mr. Simmons presented such evidence regarding his impulsivity, his susceptibility to peer pressure, and his immaturity. But he didn't present that at trial. There is a mechanism in Missouri for him to do that and he chose not to.\n Before you go off on this, the one statistic that interested me -- and I'd like you to discuss its relevance really -- is if we look back 10 years, I have only three States executing a juvenile: Texas, 11; Virginia, 3; and Oklahoma, 2.\n Correct.\n And those three States account for about 11 percent of the population of the country, 11.3 percent. Now, if we go back a few more years to Stanford, we get three others in there: Louisiana, 1; Georgia, 1; and Missouri, 1.\n And if you go to the convictions rather than the executions, then Alabama goes into that mix.\n We have a very different number.\n Right.\n So the reason that I thought arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is there are a lot of States. Say, New Hampshire, I think, for example -- when I was in the First Circuit, there were several States that on the books permitted the death penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed. And -- and that's true across the country. There are a number of States like that. So if we look at the States that actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of the population are in such States. You go back 15 years, and you get these three other States, which raises the percentage. How -- how should I understand that? I'm interested in both sides --\n Frankly, we don't know what those numbers mean because we don't know to what extent juveniles are committing capital level murders. We -- and there is no way in current social science to make that determination. It's interesting that among the three States -- two of the three States that are on that list that Justice Breyer mentioned are States in which there is a specific instruction to the jury, or indeed, in Texas, a requirement, that the jury evaluate future dangerousness. That is, the argument that was referred to by opposing -- or that counsel made, the State's counsel made, the prosecutor made, in the -- in the trial here, there's actually an instruction in some of those States. And that may play into the manner in which this -- those States -- the reason those States have additional convictions and additional executions. But Missouri doesn't have that. We don't require that the jury find future dangerousness, and although that may come up in the course of a mitigation and aggravation argument in the penalty phase, it isn't highlighted like it is in those States. And that may be more problematic than the system that Missouri has created. If the kind of evidence, psychosocial evidence, that is cited in Mr. Simmons' brief had been presented at the penalty phase, of course there would have been an opportunity to rebut it, to question it. Instead, what we have in this case is the marshaling of untested evidence from various cause groups and some dispassionate observers.\n At what point was this inserted into the record, Mr. Layton?\n The -- the kind of -- well, as to Mr. Simmons specifically, it came in in the post conviction proceeding, and then was also present in the habeas record. In this case, the -- the lengthy litany of scientific studies appeared for the first time in his brief in this Court. There were references to a few of them before, but nothing --\n It was never -- never tested in the trial court.\n Oh, no. Oh, no, because he never made the argument in the trial court during his trial that -- that scientifically he was too immature to be culpable to the degree that would merit capital punishment.\n Well, at least to the extent that he's simply quoting public sources, you had a chance to quote public sources in -- in return.\n Absolutely.\n So I think you're -- you're even on that --\n Absolutely.\n -- or at least your opportunity is.\n I -- and I think the reason that we did that and we cited the difficulties in our reply brief with what he cited is to highlight that the precise age is a legislative question based on legislative type facts. Legislatures can evaluate this series of studies and then pick what is essentially an arbitrary age. There is no study in anything that Mr. Simmons cites that -- that justifies that particular day, 18. They talk about adolescence. They talk about young adolescence, old adolescence. They talk about adolescence continuing until the mid-20's. Nothing justifies the age of 18. That makes it the kind of fact that a legislature ought to be evaluating, not a court.\n Does adolescence as a scientific term -- does it always occur on the same day for -- for all individuals?\n No. The -- the studies point out that adolescence is -- well, they don't agree on what adolescence means, and they don't -- and they point out that it begins and ends on different times for different people. So we don't know what adolescence means in the studies, and we don't know what it would mean were the Court to base a decision on the -- this concept of adolescence. I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, if there are no other questions.\n Very well, Mr. Layton. Mr. Waxman, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Everyone agrees that there is some age below which juveniles can't be subjected to the death penalty. The question here is where our society's evolving standards of decency now draw that line. 15 years ago, this Court found insufficient evidence to justify a bright line at 18, but since Stanford, a consensus has evolved and new scientific evidence has emerged, and these developments change the constitutional calculus for much the same reasons the Court found compelling in Atkins. As was noted --\n Can the constitutional calculus ever move in the other direction? I mean, once we hold that, you know, 16 is the age, if there's new scientific evidence that shows that some people are quite mature at 18 or at -- at 17-and-a-half or if -- if there is a -- a new feeling among the people that youthful murderers are, indeed, a serious problem and -- and deterrence is necessary, can we ever go back?\n Well, there is a --\n It's sort of a one-way ratchet. Isn't it?\n There is a one-way ratchet here as there is whenever this Court draws a constitutional line; that is, whenever this Court determines that the Constitution preempts the ability of legislatures to make --\n Well, but what -- what if a State legislature decides that, sure, the Supreme Court said in the Simmons case that you can't execute anybody under 18, but we think there's kind of a tendency the other way, we're going to pass a statute and see what happens in court?\n Well, you could -- you could have, I guess, what I refer to as the Dickerson v. United States phenomenon. It could come up. But what's -- what's really interesting -- I think what's --\n Is it -- is that a closed book? I mean, granted, you may lose the argument, but is it a permissible argument that the standards have evolved the other way?\n It -- it certainly would be a permissible -- permissible argument. What's -- what's notable here, Justice Scalia and Mr. Chief Justice, is how robust this consensus is. We're talking not only about the whole variety of ways in which our society has concluded that 18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood and that 18 is the line below which we preserve -- presume immaturity. But the line with respect to executions, the trend is very robust and it is very deep.\n We don't -- we don't use 18 for everything. Aren't there States that -- that allow adolescents to drive at the age of 16?\n There are nine States that allow adolescents to drive at the age of 16 without their parents' consent. That -- driving, of course, is the classic example, but --\n With their parents' consent --\n Right.\n With their parents' consent, how many?\n To -- to -- there are 41 States that require parental consent below 18.\n But they can drive.\n But they can drive if their parents agree. My -- my --\n If it's okay with the parents, it's okay with the State.\n My point here is that with respect to the death penalty, we have a substantial consensus within the United States, as it happens, exactly the same lineup as existed in -- as existed in -- was true in Atkins. We have not just a worldwide consensus that represents the better view in Europe. There are 194 countries --\n Well, how does one -- how does one determine what is the better view?\n I was -- I was referring to the implication that it has often been said that because the European Union thinks something, we should, therefore, presume that the world views it that way. We're now talking about --\n Are you suggesting that we adopt that principle?\n To the contrary. My point is we are not talking about just what a particular European treaty requires. We -- the -- the eight States that -- that theoretically -- that have statutes that theoretically permit execution of offenders under 18 are not only alone in this country, they are alone in the world. Every country in the world, including China and Nigeria and Saudi Arabia and the -- and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, every one has agreed formally and legislatively to renounce this punishment, and the only country besides the United States that has not is Somalia, which as this Court was reminded yesterday, has no organized government. It is incapable --\n They have a lot of customs that we don't have. They don't allow most -- almost all of them do not allow -- have trial by jury. Should we -- and they think it's not only more efficient, it is fairer because juries are, you know, unpredictable and whatnot. Should we yield to the views of the rest of the world?\n Of course not, but this is a -- this is a standard which -- a constitutional test that looks to evolving standards of moral decency that go to human dignity. And in that regard, it is -- it is notable that we are literally alone in the world even though 110 countries in the world permit capital punishment for one purpose -- for one crime or another, and yet every one -- every one formally renounces it for juvenile offenders. And, Justice Kennedy, my submission isn't that that that's set -- you know, game, set, and match. It's just relevant, and I think it is relevant in terms of the existence of a consensus. There was reference made by my opponent to the fact that there are four States that set the age at 17 and four States that set the age at 16. No -- in terms of movement, no one has suggested that any of those States or any other State has ever lowered the age. In fact, if you look at those particular -- those eight States, a number of them legislated an age that represented raising the number over what had previously been permitted. The movement, as this Court addressed, talked about in Atkins, has all been in one direction, and it's not as if that movement, in and of itself, answers the question. But where you have the type of consensus that exists here, as it did in Atkins, and where you have a scientific community that in Stanford was absent -- the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the major medical and scientific associations, were not able in 1989, based on the evidence, to come to this Court and say there is scientific, empirical validation for requiring that the line be set at 18.\n Well, in fact, the American Psychological Association is not your brief. You're not accountable for inconsistencies there. But I -- I would like your comment. They came to us in Hodgson v. Minnesota, as I think the State quite correctly points out, and said that with reference to the age for determining whether the child could have an abortion without parental consent, that adults -- that they -- that they were risk -- that they could assess risk, that they had rational capacity, and they completely flip-flop in this case.\n Well --\n Is that just because of -- is that just because of this modern evidence?\n No, no, no. I don't -- I think it's -- it may be in small part to that, Justice Kennedy, but I think the main point is that what their brief looked to -- what the argument was was our -- are adolescents cognitively different than adults. And the answer is, as we -- our brief concedes, is generally no. And what was at issue in the abortion cases was competency to decide. And just as we allow the mentally retarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an abortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is reserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so depraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here competency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded, isn't the issue. Christopher Simmons was found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed this offense with the specific intent necessary to do it, just as the mentally retarded can be. The issue in Hodgson was cognitive ability to be able to make a competent decision. And so I don't -- I didn't represent the APA then and I don't now, but I don't, with respect, think there's an inconsistency. In fact, the difference here goes to the factors that Atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the mentally retarded -- and here adolescents -- are less morally capable. They are much, much less likely to be sufficiently mature to be among the worst of the worst. And here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the few 16- and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even determine it, be -- we could determine were in fact so depraved that they were among the worst of the worst, there is no way reliably to identify them and there's no way reliably to exclude them. And it is in this respect that science I think changes. At the time of Stanford, everybody on this Court, of course, knew what all of us as adults intuitively know, which is that adolescents -- and -- and here we're talking about -- I agree that when adolescence starts and when it ends is undefined. But every scientific and medical journal and study acknowledges that 16- and 17-year-olds are the heartland. No one excludes them. And what we know from the science essentially explains and validates the consensus that society has already developed.\n If all of this is so clear, why can't the State legislature take it into account?\n Well, one could have said --\n I mean, if it's such an overwhelming case that -- that we can prescribe it for the whole country, you would expect that the number of States that -- that now permit it would not permit it. All you have to do is bring these facts to the attention of the legislature, and they can investigate the accuracy of the studies that the American Psychological Association does or other associations in a manner that we can't. We just have to read whatever you put in front of us.\n Justice Scalia, the number of States that engage in these executions is very small, and if it were all of the States, none of this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence would ever have to come -- would ever have to be developed. But --\n But that's precisely because the jury considers youthfulness as one of the mitigating factors. It doesn't surprise me that the death penalty for 16- to 18-year-olds is rarely imposed. I would expect it would be. But it -- it's a question of whether you leave it to the jury to evaluate the person's youth and take that into account or whether you adopt a hard rule that nobody who is under 18 is -- is -- has committed such a heinous crime with such intent that he -- that he deserves the death penalty.\n Justice -- Justice Scalia, there's no doubt -- and the jury was instructed -- that age is a mitigating factor although, Justice Kennedy, in response to your question, our brief points out prosecutors, in the context of future dangerousness, which is relevant, argue it all the time and jurors intuitively think it all the time. But the fact that he could have made an individualized mitigating case or argued that he was only -- that he was young, as he did, doesn't address the constitutional problem. The constitutional problem is that overwhelmingly 16- and 17-year-olds, for reasons of the -- the developmental reasons relating to their psychosocial character --\n Well, Mr. Waxman, was that in evidence that you referred to from these various associations? Was that introduced at trial?\n The -- about the character --\n Yes.\n No. The trial was -- I'm making an observation just as in -- as in Atkins --\n Well, but I -- I would think if you want to rely on evidence like that, it ought to be introduced at trial and subject to cross examination rather than just put in amicus briefs.\n Oh, no, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not making an argument about the character or maturity of this defendant, which would have been the only thing that would be --\n No. But you're making an argument that science says people this age are simply different, and it seems to me you -- if that's to be an argument, it ought to be introduced at trial.\n I -- I -- it's an argument about what the Constitution prohibits. It's an argument about where a constitutional line should be drawn.\n Well, but you're -- you're talking facts basically and facts ordinarily are adduced at trial for cross examination.\n Well, I am not aware of any instance in which legislative facts, as you will call them, that is, facts that go to where a line should be drawn, whether it's by this Court because the Constitution ought to be so interpreted or a legislation should change, would be properly introduced to a jury that is supposed to accept the law, that has required to accept the law as is given by a judge --\n Well, how about in the -- how about in the habeas proceeding?\n In the habeas proceeding, it's -- it's -- an argument could have been made and, indeed, was made in this case that the line -- that under Atkins juvenile offenders are the same and --\n Well, was this evidence adduced at the habeas proceeding?\n The habeas -- if you're talking about the -- the scientific studies --\n Right.\n -- in peer-reviewed journals, it was not.\n Well -- well, surely at the trial, you could have had a psychiatrist testify to all the things that are in your -- in your brief, and in fact the -- it would be another argument, but maybe the -- maybe the finding was deficient on that ground as well.\n Well, we certainly could have had a psychiatrist argue that in -- generally speaking, adolescents are less mature and on a range of psychosocial factors, they --\n Well, he could have cited all the -- all the authorities you cite in your brief.\n Right. But, Justice Kennedy, I -- I concede that. The issue for this Court is whether the Constitution requires that as a matter of law, not as a matter of the application of law to a particular defendant, the line has to be drawn this way, and --\n Suppose -- suppose that all of the things set forth in your brief were eloquently set forth by a psychiatrist to the jury. Could the jury then weigh these things that you're telling us?\n The jury could have weighed these things, but there is no way, even for a psychiatrist or a psychologist, much less a juror to -- to be confident because of the inherent, documented transiency of the adolescent personality. No psychiatrist and no juror can say with confidence that the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17-year-old, on the average 2 years ago -- and this is the key point -- proceeded from enduring qualities of that person's character as opposed to the transient aspects of youth, and therefore --\n But now, that -- that itself is a purported scientific fact, what you just said, and it seems to me if we're -- if we're to rely on that, it ought to have been tested in the way most facts are.\n What the jury -- perhaps I'm not understanding your point.\n Well, you're -- you're relying on factual -- the statement you just made was -- was a factual statement about the enduring character, et cetera. Now, if -- if we are to take that as a fact, it ought to have been tested somewhere rather than just given to us in a brief.\n Well, the -- the -- an argument to the jury that regardless of what a psychiatrist or a psychologist would have said about Christopher Simmons, as a group, 16- and 17-year-olds have such labile personalities that it is impossible to know whether they're -- the crime that they committed reflected an enduring character is an argument that could have been made to spare this particular defendant, but it need not have been credited or given dispositive weight, particularly since at sentencing -- and this Court has acknowledged this in cases like Pate v. Robinson and Drope v. Illinois -- the jury is evaluating somebody, determining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later.\n But -- but if you're reluctant to give it dispositive weight in an individual case, then you come in and ask us to give it dispositive weight as a general rule, that seems to me inconsistent.\n Well, no. What I'm -- what I'm asking you to do -- what I'm suggesting is that the weight of scientific and medical evidence of which the Court can take judicial notice and should take judicial notice and did take judicial notice in cases like Atkins and Thompson and Stanford explains and validates the consensus that society has drawn. We're not arguing that the science or what a particular neurobiologist or developmental psychologist says dictates the line of 18. The question is we have a consensus. It's even more robust than it was in Atkins. Looking at proportionality and reliability with respect to that consensus, is there a good, objective, scientific reason to credit the line that society has drawn? And I'm suggesting two things. Number one, that although one could posit that there are 16- and 17-year-olds whose antisocial traits are characterological rather than transient, we know it is impossible -- we know this from common sense and it's been validated by science, of which the Court can take note, that it is impossible to know whether the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17 year-old is a reflection of his true, enduring character or whether it's a manifestation of traits that are exhibited during adolescence. And --\n Well, suppose -- suppose I -- I were not convinced about your scientific evidence was conclusive and I don't identify a clear consensus. Do you lose the case, or can you then make the same argument you just made appealing to some other more fundamental principle that Stanford was just wrong?\n Here -- no. Well -- no. Here's what I would appeal to. I -- there are three relevant factors that this Court has to look at. There's the determination of consensus. Is there enough of a one or isn't there? There's the determination of proportionality, and then there's the issue identified in Lockett and in Atkins, which is how reliable is the individualized sentencing process. How reliably -- when we're talking about picking the tiny few who are the worst of the worst, how reliably can we do that? We think that with respect to each of those, we have demonstrated that the Eighth Amendment requires recognizing 18. But I will take as a posit your hypothetical question that I haven't convinced you on number one, number two, or perhaps individually on all three. This is truly a case, Justice Kennedy, in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Taken together, the fact that it's impossible for a jury to know whether the crime of an adolescent was really the feature of an enduring character, since we know, as in Atkins, that many of the characteristics that manifest themselves in mental retardation also affect the inability of adolescents to communicate with their attorneys, to express remorse, that 2 years later when this person is on trial, physically, emotionally it's not the same person that the jury is looking at and being asked to evaluate --\n So that -- that's -- that last point was what I thought the scientific evidence was getting at, that it simply confirmed what common sense suggests, that when you execute a person 15 or sometimes 20 years later, a problem always is that that person isn't the same person who committed the trial in a meaningful sense. And it's specially true of 16- and 17 year-olds who, observation would suggest, have a lot of changing to do because their personality is not fully formed. Now, I thought that the -- the scientific evidence simply corroborated something that every parent already knows, and if it's more than that, I would like to know what more.\n Well, it's -- I think it's -- it's more than that in a couple of respects. It -- it explains, corroborates, and validates what we sort of intuitively know, not just as parents but in adults that -- that -- who live in a world filled with adolescents. And -- and the very fact that science -- and I'm not just talking about social science here, but the important neurobiological science that has now shown that these adolescents are -- their character is not hard-wired. It's why, for example -- here's a -- here's an interesting and relevant scientific fact. Psychiatrists under the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is their Bible, are precluded from making a diagnosis of antisocial personality before the age of 18 precisely because before the age of 18, personality and character are not fixed even with respect to --\n Mr. Waxman, I -- I thought we punish people, criminals, for what they were, not for what they are. I mean, you know, if you have someone who commits a heinous crime and by the time he's brought to trial and convicted, he's come to Jesus, we don't let him off because he's not now what he was then. It seems to me we punish people for what they were.\n We --\n And to say that adolescents change, everybody changes, but that doesn't justify eliminating the -- the proper punishments that society has determined.\n I think, with respect, Justice Scalia, I'm not -- I think that there is an interesting question about -- with respect to death, whether what they are and what they will become is totally irrelevant. But accepting the premise of your question, my point is that science has confirmed what we intuitively know, which is that when the jury gets around to evaluating what the character was that manifested that horrible crime, they can't tell because of the passage of age and because of a number of confounding factors and because psychologists and psychiatrists can't tell themselves whether the crime that occurred 2 years ago or 2 weeks ago was the manifestation of an enduring character or transient psychosocial traits that rage in adolescence.\n Is part of your answer based on the length of time between the killing and the trial?\n Only part, Mr. Chief Justice. Part of it is that the jury, of course, is looking at the defendant, and we have laid before the Court peer-reviewed scientific studies that show that they -- that people are -- frequently equate maturity and psychosocial development with race and with physical appearance. In addition, because the adolescent personality is transient and the lapse of time for trial is 2 years, in a very real sense psychosocially as opposed to -- in addition to physically, the person that the jury is judging is not the -- is not a manifestation of the person who committed the crime.\n Well, what if -- what if a State said I see the problem, so we'll bring this person to trial in 6 weeks?\n Even if it were in 6 weeks, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the process is -- is sufficiently -- that would just make the youth the same as the mentally retarded, because the mentally retarded have stable personalities and stable characters, and yet, what this Court said in Atkins was we have two things to say. One is that overwhelmingly as a group the mentally retarded are unlikely to be among the very worst of the worst, and the very deficits that they have -- that you called deficits in reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, makes the jury -- the process of the jury evaluating the moral culpability, the moral blameworthiness unreliable. And it's on the basis of those two things that we think that the consensus that's otherwise reflected is validated. And here --\n I have -- I have one other question I'd like to ask because it's been troubling me and I want your comment. A number of juveniles run in gangs and a number of the gang members are over 18. If we ruled in your favor and this decision was given wide publicity, wouldn't that make 16-, 17-year-olds subject to being persuaded to be the hit men for the gangs?\n Well --\n I'm -- I'm very concerned about that.\n I -- I am also concerned about it, and I -- I have thought about this. First of all, if they are enlisted by people over the age of 18 to do that, the -- the precise degree of culpability goes to the people who are over 18, and juries ought to consider whether people who are over the age of 18 have so enlisted them. But even -- but with respect to --\n I'm talking about the deterrent value of the existing rule insofar as the 16 and 17-year-old. If -- if we rule against you, then the deterrent remains.\n Well, I think -- I think, as with the mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the mentally retarded, adolescents -- the -- the role of deterrence has even less to say, precisely because they weigh risks differently and they don't see the future and they are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure. And in fact, if you look at what happened in this case, it's as good an example as any. The State says, well, okay, you know, he -- you know, this guy, according to the State's witness, the person, who was over 18 and described as the Fagin of this group of juveniles, testified to the court, well, Christopher Simmons says, let's do it because, quote, we can get away with it.\n Well, there were a number -- a number of cases in the Alabama amicus brief, which is chilling reading -- and I wish that all the people that sign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before they sign on to them -- indicates that often the 17-year-old is the ringleader.\n Well, the 17-year-old may be the ringleader, and even if you posit that Christopher Simmons was the ringleader here, he -- he wasn't under any illusions. He wasn't making a statement about being executed. He said, we could get away with it, which speaks volumes about the -- the extent to which -- this guy was subject to life without parole, which is, Justice Scalia, fundamentally different than death. This Court has said that only when the penalty is death, do you look at the character of the defendant as opposed to the nature of the crime and the act. But the data shows -- and I think this Court has acknowledged -- it acknowledged in Thompson in any event -- that the -- that adolescents like the -- the mentally retarded are much less likely to be deterred by the prospect of an uncertain, even if probable, very substantial penalty. The -- no mature adult would have thought, as Chris Simmons reportedly said, I can get away with this because I'm 17 years old, when the mandatory punishment for him would have been life in prison. It's -- it is not -- eliminating the death penalty as an option, which is -- which is imposed so rarely as to be more freakish than the death penalty was in Furman -- three States in the last 10 years, one --\n But of course, the death penalty was not a deterrent for any of the crimes described in the Alabama brief because those are all -- crimes all occurred in States which execute people under 18.\n Yes, and I -- and I -- the -- the examples in the Alabama brief are horrifying. But if you look at those examples, the very first one, this is a kid who went on a killing spree, including his father, because he felt he was unjustly deprived use of the family truck. And there -- I can go through the other examples, but these are posited as people who a jury could, with a degree of reliability that the Constitution requires, say acted out of a stable, enduring character rather than transient aspects of youth? I think that's a poster child for us.\n Whereas if it had been done by an 18-year-old, a jury could have said that.\n Well --\n If an 18-year-old did the same thing, you say, well, he's certainly stable.\n May I answer? Briefly. The line -- the science shows what common sense understands which is that development is a continuum, but the line, 18, is one that has been drawn by society.\n Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Layton, you have 8 minutes remaining.\n Mr. Simmons, of course, was found by the jury to be the ringleader. And in essence, that creates a contrast with the Lee Malvo case where we had something like what Justice Kennedy referred to, adults influencing a juvenile, and the jury was able to make that distinction in the Virginia Lee Malvo case.\n May I ask this question, Mr. Layton? This case kind of raises a question about the basic State interests that are involved here, and the State interests that justify the death penalty include deterrence and also retribution.\n Yes.\n Which, if either, of those do you think is the primary State interest you seek to vindicate today?\n I -- I think that they are of equal weight in the minds of the legislators in the State of Missouri. The -- Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking this Court to --\n May I just ask one further?\n Yes.\n Is there any evidence that the death penalty for those under 18 or even above has, in fact, had any deterrent value?\n From all that I have read, the evidence both directions is inconclusive, Your Honor, and thus, subject to legislators' determination. Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking the Court to elevate proportionality to be equivalent to -- to a consensus. But let me just highlight two aspects of the non-capital case proportionality jurisprudence of this Court. Justice Kennedy, in -- in Harmelin recently cited by the plurality in Ewing, pointed out that two of the considerations in proportionality review in those instances are the primacy of the legislature and the nature of the Federal system. What we should have here is a principle that is a principle dealing with immaturity, and the States, within the Federal system, should be able to make the determination as to how to implement it. As pointed out, this Court's jurisprudence in Eighth Amendment areas has proven to be a one-way ratchet, and because of that, the Court has to be very wary of leading rather than reflecting societal norms. Now, there are some States, of course, that have raised the age, the minimum age, for capital punishment, but at least in some instances, such as Missouri, that is a reaction to this Court's jurisprudence, that is, a reaction to Thompson and Stanford. Other States have left 18 for other purposes, and yet there still is a role by this Court. Pornography is an example. I am confident that but for this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, the Missouri General Assembly would adopt a statute that said that pornography should not be allowed at ages much higher than 18 and not because of maturity, but because of their opposition to pornography. In many of the instances cited by Mr. Simmons, the kind of statutes that he cites, gambling and others, it is a compromise in the legislative arena, not necessarily based on maturity or immaturity, that leads to the selection of the age of 18. Many States have, of course, individualized determinations with regard to those statutes. There was a discussion of driver's licenses. In Missouri, of course, we allow people to drive at age 15. They have to have parental consent, yes, but there also is a test. That is, there is an individualized determination before we do that, and that's what the State requests here. Mr. Simmons' counsel points out that in Atkins the Court took judicial notice of psychosocial evidence, and that's true. The Court did. But remember that what the Court had before it in Atkins was not a proxy for a -- a factor that plays into culpability. It was, in fact, the factor itself, that is mental capacity. And what they want here is not a determination as to the maturity or the capacity of individuals. They want a bright line test that is based purely on age. This Court should adopt, as it did in Atkins, a principle and leave it to the States to act. That's what the Court did in --\n Of course, one -- one of the objections in -- in Atkins was we needed a bright line test. We'd have difficulty determining which ones are mentally retarded. Here we don't have that problem at all. I guess everybody knows whether or not the defendant is over or under 18.\n Well, if that's the bright line. We don't know whether they're mature or immature, and we have to measure that somehow.\n But the -- but the purpose of a bright line test is to avoid litigation over the borderline cases, and you just have completely avoided that in this category.\n Because the -- having a bright line test means that the individual who murders at age 17, 364 days is treated differently than a more -- a less mature individual who is 2 days older.\n But it's an equally arbitrary line if it's 16, 17, or 15.\n Yes, it is, and it's an arbitrary line that the legislatures have set because it's a legislative type determination based on what even Mr. Waxman called legislative facts.\n May I ask one -- have you read the brief of the former U.S. diplomats in the case?\n Yes.\n Do you think we should give any credence whatsoever to the arguments they make?\n No. (Laughter.)\n The respect of other countries for our country is something we should totally ignore.\n That's not for this Court to decide. Congress should consider that. The legislatures should consider that. It's an important consideration, but it is not a consideration under the Eighth Amendment.\n We should leave it up to the legislature of the State of Missouri to resolve those questions.\n Within the parameters of -- of Thompson and Stanford, yes. Yes. The Missouri Supreme Court -- the Atkins v. Virginia -- in Atkins v. Virginia, this Court did not authorize the Missouri Supreme Court to reject Stanford. The Court should refuse to -- to sanction such activity by the lower courts and continue the course it set in that decision. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Layton. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents the issue of whether the California Department of Corrections, unlike every other State in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, may continue its more than 28-year, unexamined practice of routine, blanket racial segregation of its prisoners. The unitary practice in question here was applied more than 350,000 times last year, not just to the 40,000 new prisoners entering the California system, but to all 72,000 returning parolees and hundreds of thousands of transfer prisoners such as the petitioner in this case, Garrison Johnson, a petitioner who had been housed for more than 15 years in the California prison system. This unexamined, routine practice effectively erected whites only, blacks only, Hispanics only signs over the portals of the California prison system, and it is a practice which is routed in racial stereotype and the belief that all persons of a race think alike and act alike. California's needless and dangerous policy fails both the strict scrutiny test, which the Ninth Circuit should have applied, and the Turner deference standard, which the Ninth Circuit wrongly applied.\n Is California the only State, to your knowledge, to apply this procedure?\n Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is. The --\n The -- the statistics showed that there were -- I'm sorry. I don't have it right at my fingerprints -- fingertips -- only about 200,000 processing incidents a year, 200,000 people a year to be processed. I take it that includes some people that are being transferred?\n Yes, correct, Your Honor. In -- in the circumstances in this case, Petitioner Johnson, for example, during his 15 years, had been transferred on five separate occasions, and the circumstances which he experienced are not unusual within the California prison system. Indeed, an outside-the-record fact: within the last three weeks, he's been informed that he's to be transferred yet again within the California prison system to another facility called Corcoran.\n May -- may I put aside for a moment the question of the strength of your argument in transfer situations and simply go to the circumstances of the original receipt of the prisoner for the first time into the prison system? What do the other States -- you say California is the only one that -- that makes this racial assignment like this. What do the other States do to guard against an -- an explosive team-up in -- in double-celled prisoners when -- when they're taking them in for the first time?\n The circumstances in other States, which we've been able to identify, include a range of -- of circumstances, which include -- as is available in California under the penal code section, which requires the delivery of a presentence report, together with a commitment order, is analysis on a particularized circumstance basis of the individuals who are coming into the prison and making a -- an estimate as to what may occur. Other States use a random assignment circumstance, and giving no consideration whatever to race. And a third group of States apparently consider race as part of an overall or holistic bit of analysis with regard to trying to equalize the prison populations.\n Do you know if there are in these other States the same incidents of racial riots or racial killings or racial attacks?\n Well, the best empirical evidence which exists that we're familiar with was reported in the Trulson study, which the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit petition for rehearing en banc relied upon and which the amici have filed with this Court. And in that circumstance, it suggests, over a 10-year study in Texas, that only five percent of all of the interracial -- of -- of all of the incidents of violence in -- in the Texas prison system were what was described by Professor Trulson as having racial motivations. And of that five percent, only one-quarter, or about 1.2 percent, were interracial circumstances where there had been interracial cellmates involved in the racial violence. And that seems to be, as far as anyone has been able to produce in this case in any part of the record, the best empirical data which might respond to your question, Justice Scalia.\n Were there any incidents in California's prisons of same cellmates of different races having episodes of violence? Or -- this is an old policy. So were there incidents like that that led to the development of the policy?\n Justice Ginsburg, one of the interesting things about the record in this case is that the State of California has been unable to identify a single incident of a -- of interracial violence between cellmates. The record is bereft of that kind of information. Rather, they've spoken of information about violence which occurs in more --\n Well, they say that that proves that their policy is very effective. I mean, that's -- (Laughter.)\n I think the -- I think the record suggests, as at least in the testimony of Mr. Johnson, that it is a de facto segregation system which exists after the 60-day period and outside the transfer 60-day period, and so it would be hard for the State of California to provide -- to provide that data.\n Suppose you were to prevail in this case and a court were to enter a decree forbidding this practice. A month later, there is an incident in which one prisoner is seriously injured in a -- in a prison cell because of the interracial assignment policy. Would that be grounds for rethinking the decree?\n Well, Justice Kennedy, it seems to me that under the Court's strict scrutiny analysis, which in my judgment should have applied here, and under the particularized circumstance test announced in the Lee case in the concurrence, that a circumstance involving a single prisoner in a single prison cell on one occasion ought not to give rise to a systematic change in -- in a policy which is rooted in racial stereotype. With regard to those prisoners involved in that particular circumstance, of course, some period of -- of segregation would be appropriate as a means of controlling and ensuring that there's not going to be some kind of wholesale racial violence. That --\n What is -- what is sacrosanct about the -- about the constitutional right not to be subjected to racial stereotype? There are a lot of other constitutional rights that people in prison give up. That's one of the consequences of committing a crime and being sent to prison, the most fundamental constitutional right, the right to -- to walk around and -- and not be seized. Why -- why is it that this -- this one constitutional right cannot yield to what prison authorities believe is -- is a useful, not necessarily essential, but a useful means of -- of maintaining order in prison?\n Well, Justice Scalia, the fundamental teachings on the Fourteenth Amendment of this Court demonstrate that race is different, that the government use of race is presumed to be unlawful --\n Oh, it's -- it's different from First Amendment rights? Prisoners can't hold news conferences. I mean, there are all sorts of very important constitutional rights that I think are no more important than the Equal Protection Clause which prisoners yield when they're in prison. Now, do we subject the taking away of all of these rights to strict scrutiny when the prison authorities do it? I don't think so. I think we say if it's -- if it's the judgment of the -- of the prison authorities, we -- we generally defer to it.\n Yes. The Turner standard certainly reflects a consideration by this Court that deference is appropriate with regard to rights which are inconsistent with incarceration.\n Well, even First Amendment rights.\n Even First Amendment rights.\n Isn't that so?\n Yes, Justice O'Connor.\n Which is a terribly important set of rights for individuals, is it not?\n Yes. The First Amendment rights are very important.\n Right.\n However, in the context of incarceration, a sacrifice of the right to assembly, the right to correspond in certain circumstances, to contact visits are things which are well within the ambit of what a prison needs to control.\n No, I don't think so. I -- why would holding a news conference disrupt a prison? It wouldn't. You say it's too much trouble. We don't want news conferences in prison.\n And in -- and in the circumstances that the Court's test has been announced in Turner, that's certainly within the ambit of a right which the prison authorities might properly exercise.\n And why is this not one?\n Well, because this Court decided --\n Because it -- it is no -- there is no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, the Aryan Brotherhood and -- and Hispanic gangs and -- and black gangs. There's no doubt that that exists. Is it --\n There's no doubt -- Justice Scalia, there's no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, but this policy of California is directed not to the gang aspect of it but to the race aspect. The record is clear that there's a near zero percent chance that any black person could be housed with any white person, that any white person could be housed with any Hispanic person, without reference to the gang question. And this is a transfer policy which recurs and recurs, five times in the case of -- of --\n Mr. Deixler, do you think you lose if we apply Turner?\n No, Your Honor. We believe that even under Turner --\n Well, why isn't that the right approach to the case then if that's the -- we don't have to meddle with the rules governing the -- the conduct of prisons, if you can prevail under that theory?\n We would -- we would be pleased to -- to prevail under -- under Turner, Justice Stevens. It seems that consistent with the Court's teachings under the Fourteenth Amendment and the most recent considerations by the Court of equal protection and strict scrutiny, that the use of race by California in this context should trigger a strict scrutiny analysis, should lead to an analysis of whether there has been narrow tailoring. But under the Turner test, we believe properly applied, the petitioner should prevail as well. Under the Turner test, it seems that at least two of the four elements which are announced in Turner couldn't possibly be met here. The first one is it seems to be no -- there is no reasonable relationship between the government regulation which is at issue and the announced policy. The notion that one can determine by race alone a violent propensity seems irrational, unreasonable, and contrary to the only empirical evidence which exists, the Trulson study.\n Suppose you have a population in which 50 percent of all the members of a particular race are a member of a -- of a gang, a gang such as we've read about in -- in the record, Bloods, Crips, et cetera. 50 percent are members of the gang. Would that allow you to segregate?\n No, I don't think such a statistic --\n Is -- is that because you don't equate race gangs with race animosity?\n Well, in fact, in part that's correct, Justice Kennedy. The -- the --\n And -- because it does seem to me that part of your submission, or at least an inference that I drew, was that race-based gangs do not constitute race-based threats. Am I right in saying that that's your submission?\n Without more, Justice Kennedy, that inference cannot be drawn, and I'll give the Court the example of the Crips and the Bloods --\n You mean the inference that the -- which inference? That they are or are not a threat?\n That they are not to the extent that, Justice Kennedy, you're asking whether it is an interracial threat. It is -- it is undoubtedly true, taking the example of the Crips and the Bloods, that they are intra-racial threats, and indeed prison policy directed towards separating Crips and Bloods because of the -- of the intraracial problem is certainly one which would be something that the -- the prison system should address.\n -- assume that a gang poses an interracial threat?\n The -- there's no evidence which has been produced in this record which would suggest that the policy can be tied from skin color to gang membership and from gang membership to interracial violence.\n I -- I asked -- I asked about gang membership. Can gang membership be equated with an interracial threat in any significant number of -- of gangs?\n Not in the record of this case, Justice Kennedy.\n I don't -- you -- you don't need it in the record. You -- you know what the Aryan Brotherhood is. It -- it is a white group that is hostile to blacks in particular, and you know what the Bloods are. It is a black group that -- that is hostile to whites. And -- and does it take any more than common sense to know that if you put a tattooed member of one group in with a tattooed member of the other group, the likelihood of violence in that cell is going to be greater? And is any more than that needed for -- for the -- for the prison not to cell them together? Would you acknowledge that at least if the -- not just on the basis that one is white and one is black, but if the prison knows that -- that one is a member of the Aryan Brotherhood and the other is a member of the Bloods, the prison can refuse to -- to assign them to the same cell?\n Yes.\n Okay.\n What is the --\n All right. Now -- now suppose -- I didn't mean to intrude on Justice Breyer, but just following this question, suppose that 50 percent of all the inmate population in a particular small prison is a member of one of these gangs. Then could you segregate on account of race?\n I think on race alone, the prison system would run afoul of the Constitution in making that determination. If it -- if race were analyzed in the context of gang membership, as part of an overall analysis of proclivity to violence based upon a series of facts existing in that prison, particularized circumstances, as suggested in the Lee case, I think that would be a proper analysis and constitutional. It's --\n Well, would it be a proper analysis simply to -- to separate or not based on gang membership?\n Yes, Justice Souter.\n No. Your answer to Justice Scalia stands on that. So you would not be making an argument that gang membership is merely a surrogate for race in that case if that were the policy.\n Yes. In that particular case, gang membership is not a surrogate for race. In the California policy, race is a surrogate for gang membership.\n Okay.\n I'd like to reserve the balance of my --\n May I -- may I ask just one question? I understand the -- your position that Turner is enough to cover this, but you're going-in position was that race is different, even different than the First Amendment. And you gave one other example, the Eighth Amendment. It may be convenient, make things easier for the administration of a prison if prisoners are tortured every now and then to keep them in line, but obviously, the Eighth Amendment prevails over that. Is there anything else that you say is -- is so fundamental that we don't do it, like torture? And -- and you say race segregation belongs in that category. Anything else?\n Yes. Well, in this Court's opinion in the McKune case under a Fifth Amendment analysis, it was found that that didn't -- it was not analyzed under a Turner standard. And even in the Harper case, before the determination of the liberty right being taken under the Turner standard, the Court relied upon procedural due process rights which were exercised in -- in the State of Washington with regard to -- to the prisoner. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n Mr. Clement.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents the Court with an opportunity to reaffirm that all government policies based on race are subject to strict scrutiny. The deference generally owed to the sound judgment of prison officials does not require this Court to modify its repeated statements that all government action based on race should be subject to strict scrutiny.\n We say the same about the First Amendment, don't we? All government actions restricting speech are subject to strict scrutiny. Right? And yet, we allow that to occur in prison.\n Well, I think that this Court has recognized in a variety of contexts, including when they have -- when justices have made reference to prison policies, that all government actions based on race are subject to strict scrutiny.\n Unlike the First Amendment.\n The First Amendment obviously has been subjected, at least when you're talking about things other than outgoing prisoner mail, to be subjected to the Turner analysis, but note -- this Court has never suggested that the Turner analysis applies to race.\n Mr. Clement, will you tell us how the Government would come out applying the Turner analysis in this case?\n Absolutely, Justice Stevens. I think if the Turner analysis is correctly applied in this case, this policy does not even survive Turner analysis. I would suggest it's very analogous to the marriage policy that the Court struck down in Turner applying the Turner analysis because there the State identified a concern with inmate marriages and particularly with inmate-to-inmate marriages, and yet they adopted a policy that prohibited all inmate marriages. Here there's a concern that's expressed with newly arriving inmates, about whom California says it knows very little. Yet, it applies its policies to transferring inmates, as well as to returning parolees.\n And why should we decide the constitutional question?\n Well, I think either one of those would be a constitutional --\n Well, it's --\n -- holding of this Court, and I think either under Turner or under strict scrutiny, it's still equally a constitutional holding. And I think it would send an improper message to suggest that there's some element of government decision-making that is somehow exempt from strict scrutiny. I think in a variety of contexts, this Court, where it generally reviews a government action deferentially -- take, for example, jury selection, peremptory challenges. Take, for example, military policy. Take, for example, congressional districting. Those are all government policies this Court generally refuse -- reviews under a highly deferential standard. Yet, nonetheless, when it comes to government policies based on race, this Court applies strict scrutiny. And in that sense, I think the racial districting cases provide a very good example because there, generally, as the Vieth case from last term illustrates, this Court is very reluctant to do any review of the districting lines that are drawn. Yet, when race is identified as being the cause for the lines being drawn, as in Miller against Johnson, this Court emphasizes that strict scrutiny applies.\n Is -- is there an argument to be made that the reason we make that emphasis and -- and an argument for you in this case that there is somehow a greater fragility to -- to the effective standards to prevent racial classification than there is to the possibility of enforcing speech rights and so on? Is there something to worry about here more than in the case of -- of enumerated rights that -- that gets the Turner analysis?\n Well, I think that's part of it, Justice Souter. I think one thing is that particularly because of the history of this country and the use of -- of race by governments, including in prisons, there is a concern that all government uses of race must be subjected to very heightened scrutiny.\n Yes, but there's a pretty frightening history about speech restriction too.\n Well, again, I think, though, that there is almost a uniquely pernicious history involving race in this country, and I think, again, it is completely wrong to suggest that somehow prisons were exempt from that history. To the contrary. Throughout the Nation before Brown against Board of Education, it was common for prisons to be segregated on the basis of race.\n This is not a permanent segregation in these California prisons. It's just temporary, isn't it? How long does it last?\n It lasts 60 days, is the best evidence.\n Until -- until they -- they have assurance that -- that the individuals are -- are not members of a gang and likely to, in -- in their view, commit racial violence if -- if co-celled with another prisoner.\n With respect, Justice --\n If it were permanent, your argument about this, you know, this is a long tradition of our prisons. We -- we keep the blacks and the whites separate. That -- that's not what they're doing in California. It's a temporary -- it's a temporary measure.\n With respect, Justice Scalia, in Lee against Washington, this Court upheld the integration not just of the Alabama prisons, but the Alabama jails, and the evidence before the Court there -- and this is clear from the three-judge opinion -- is that the average stay in the Birmingham city jail was seven to 15 days. Nonetheless, this Court said that seven to 15 days of racial segregation was too much.\n Okay, but we didn't announce a standard.\n That was for the whole stay.\n Well, that's true, Justice Souter. I mean, I think if you look at Brown against Board of Education itself and you look at the various per curiam opinions that this Court issued in the wake of Brown v. Board, I don't think any of those decisions have a hallmark of being elaborate about the standard of review that the Court has applied. Nonetheless --\n What does seven -- what does seven to 15 days have to do with anything? It was for the whole stay that they were segregated. The stay may have been short, but the fact that during their entire period they were segregated showed that there was no other purpose to this thing except to keep the races separate. Whereas, here, they are kept separate for -- for the time which the California prison believes it needs in order to assure that there won't be violence, and once that assurance is given, the races are -- are mixed. That's a totally different situation.\n With respect, Justice Scalia, I disagree. The entire time these prisoners are kept at the reception center, which is a separate part of the facility where the incoming inmates go, that entire time they are segregated on the basis of race. Now, the Bureau of Prisons, for example, has a similar entry section in its various prisons. It's called the admissions and orientations process, and there, using the presentence reports that are provided for by California law, the Federal officials evaluate prisoners and their risk levels and have no need to segregate those prisoners on the basis of race.\n One of -- one of California's response said, well, the Feds have mostly income tax evaders, maybe some drug dealers, but the State prisoners are the real tough guys, the real violent criminals. So --\n They have a high class of felons in the Federal prison basically.\n With respect, Your Honors, that misdescribes the -- the population of the Federal prisons. Part of where I think they get off on the wrong step is they do their analysis only on the offense of conviction. But a lot of the individuals in the Federal prisons are, say, for example, convicted felons who are convicted for felony in possession. And the underlying felony that led them to be, say, a 924(c) defendant was a violent felony. And so we -- there are also agreements by which the Bureau of Prisoners, on request from States, will house the State's most violent criminals. So I think that's an unfair description of what the Bureau of Prisons policy -- or population looks like. And I think the fact that the Bureau of Prisons and virtually every other State that's looked at this issue has found a mechanism to deal with the problem of incoming inmates without resorting to race is a powerful indication that this kind of use of race is unnecessary. And the problem with applying Turner, rather than strict scrutiny, I think is well illustrated by this case and this policy. This is a policy that is expressly acknowledged to take race into account, and it is nowhere written down. If you pull the Department of Correction manual for the California prison system, there's a 94-page chapter on the classification of inmates. Yet, this policy doesn't appear there. It's an unwritten policy. Justice Ginsburg, you asked, well, was this policy introduced in response to specific incidents of violence in a cell. The answer to that is unknowable because nobody even knows how long this policy has been in place. The official responsible for administering it acknowledged it's been in place for 25 years.\n Why -- why does that affect the Turner analysis? I'm sorry. I don't understand.\n What I'm suggesting, Justice O'Connor, is what the -- the application of Turner to this policy allowed. It's to allow an unwritten policy where -- of uncertain origins --\n I thought you told us earlier it wouldn't survive Turner. I -- I don't understand your argument.\n Well, it wouldn't survive a proper analysis under Turner. That is correct. But the -- the court of appeals here, applying its version of Turner, upheld this policy. And I think one way of looking at the choice between Turner and strict scrutiny is whether there is a greater threat that frequent judicial approvals of prisons' use of race will have the effect of diluting the strict scrutiny rigor or whether frequent disapprovals of prisons' use of race will have the effect of undermining the Turner deference. And the concern of the Federal Government is exactly that, that by having race policies evaluated under Turner, there will be a necessary temptation to bump up the Turner analysis in a way that strikes down racial policies.\n You're concerned about evaluating prison race policies. Are there any other prison policies in the country that adopt a racial test like that?\n Well, I think -- I think California -- it's -- it's best described as California is one of at most a couple of States that have a comparable cell-based policy of segregation. And so I think it really is kind of the outlier in terms of that analysis. Now, there may be situations -- and we think strict scrutiny can account for them -- where States want to take race into account in particularized circumstances. And I think testing those under strict scrutiny is the proper mode of analysis.\n Your --\n Thank you, Mr. Clement.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n Mr. -- Ms. Grunder.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Turner's unitary deferential standard of review balances inmates' rights with the exceptionally dangerous and difficult job of running a prison. The Turner standard applies here because the need for prison deference doesn't change with the nature of the right asserted. California is Ground Zero for raced-based prison and street gangs. The Aryan Brotherhood, the Black Guerilla Family, the Mexican Mafia, and the Nuestra Familia --\n Is there any evidence in the record that the initial placing of two inmates in the same cell has ever had -- has ever produced a racial incident?\n In the reception center, Your Honor?\n Pardon me?\n In the reception centers?\n Yes.\n No, because the -- the inmates are not interracially housed.\n You've never tried it.\n There's nothing in the record, Your Honor. The policy has been in effect for a considerable length of time, and -- and during that time, they have not interracially housed inmates in the same cell. I think it's important to remember here that the policy only applies in the reception center areas and in the cells.\n But it applies in the reception center area for someone who has been transferred as well as the -- an initial incarceration.\n It's a very shortened period for a transferee. It's only 14 days under the California regulations, and it only applies if they are put in a cell. If there is someone who is eligible to be housed in a dormitory, that is, somebody who has been convicted of a less violent offense or they have more information about, then the dormitories are fully integrated, as well as every other aspect of the reception center.\n But -- I'm sorry. Even in the case of -- of housing in cells, what's the justification for it? The argument is -- excuse me -- on the initial intake, we don't know enough about them. Well, on -- on the transfer, you've had plenty of time to know about them. Why is it justifiable even for 14 days on -- on the transfer?\n That's what I don't understand too. That -- that's really what most troubles me about this case. Why -- why do you do this to the transferees at all?\n There's a -- there's a couple of reasons, Your Honors. First of all, as much as you may know about the transferring individual, you may not know the information about their prospective cellmate at the transfer institution because they may be somebody who's a newly received cellmate, somebody who is going through a reception center process themselves.\n Well, unless you house them with the cellmate, what are you going to learn from segregating them for 14 days?\n What happens when they arrive at the receiving institution is there needs to be time for a record review. The records do not arrive at the exact same time as the inmates. And so they convene a classification committee and at which point they review the records.\n Well, if we have a choice between segregating by race and speeding up the delivery of records, isn't it constitutionally preferable to get the records delivered on time?\n The records need to stay with the inmate at the old prison until the inmate leaves on the bus for the new prison because --\n Why? Don't you have xeroxes? (Laughter.)\n Well, in the case of California, there's over 165,000 inmates. In Mr. Johnson's case, his records probably are many, many banker's boxes full of records. So that's the type of --\n When -- when -- there's a transferee from prison A to prison B and he goes to the reception center. Does that transferee get housed with other transferees or is he also housed, from time to time or often, with new entrants into the system?\n He may be housed with new entrants into the system and that -- that's the reason --\n So -- so as to one-half of the people in that -- in that instance, you don't know what the other inmate's record is.\n That's correct, Your Honor. And I would like to --\n You could house transferees only with other transferees, I assume.\n That's --\n Is that -- is that too hard to figure out?\n That's possible, Your Honor. That currently is not the practice, but that is possible.\n Ms. Grunder, is this policy a -- an unwritten policy of California?\n It is -- yes, it is a practice. I wouldn't characterize it a policy. It's a practice.\n An admitted practice but not written.\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n And is -- does any other State have such a policy, written or otherwise?\n Yes, they do, Your Honor, and I would like to address that. The two largest States of inmate population, California and Texas, together comprise about 300,000 inmates, which is about 20 percent of the total inmate prison population in the United States, including the Bureau of Prisons. Those two States have a similar policy. In addition, Oklahoma --\n What is Texas' policy? Is that in writing?\n Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor. When Texas was subjected to the integration decree, the one area of the prison that was not part of the decree that they did not require them to integrate was the area that is the equivalent of our reception center. There -- there in --\n Is in the briefs? I don't remember it from the briefs. Did -- did you discuss this in --\n Yes, Your Honor, it is in the briefs. It's -- it has to do with the Trulson study, and the Trulson study indicated that the intake diagnostic centers of Texas were not required to be integrated.\n All right. If we -- if we exclude Texas and California, on your recording, we've still got 80 percent of the -- the prison population in the United States, and apparently neither the Federal prisons nor any State does -- apart from Texas, has this policy. Why -- I mean, how do you account for the fact that there doesn't seem to be any evidence that -- that they are having explosive incidents involving new members based upon racial animosity?\n Your Honor, actually there's another State, Oklahoma, which has a very similar policy that says that --\n Okay. We've still got 47 States left. How -- how do you explain the fact that -- and -- and some of them don't have your racial problems. There's no question about it. I come from one that does not. But some do. And -- and how do you explain the fact that there is no sort of confirmatory record of what happens when you don't follow your policy?\n Well, I think the answer is that they don't have the same problems that California has. California has the most prison gangs, the -- they are race-based. It's an extraordinarily difficult situation. And even the Bureau of Prisons takes race into account when it balances its prisons and that's in the United States' brief.\n May I go back to Texas? Because one of the pieces of information that was featured by the other side was this study in Texas that showed a decline in interracial violence when there was an increase in racial integration. So that empirical study showed just the opposite, that when you integrate, you get less violence than when you separate.\n Yes, Your Honor. The Trulson study, however, only looked at inmates after they had left the reception center, only looked at inmates in -- in the integrated settings of the prison, equivalent to the areas that California integrates. So we don't dispute that once you have enough individualized information about an inmate, then you can house them according to an individualized information.\n On the individualized, there was something that I didn't grasp. You say we don't know anything about these people, so we have to have that 60-day period to find out about them. The presentence report we're told accompanies the conviction, the prisoner's conviction. So the presentence report will have a fair amount of information about the offender, will it not?\n It would have a fair amount of information. However, in California, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not. It follows some period of time later from the county.\n But again, that's the kind of administrative problem that would seem easily fixable. I thought the -- the rule or the regulation was that the presentence report is supposed to accompany the conviction.\n But the fact of the matter is, Your Honor, the counties aren't preparing the presentences -- presentence reports in a timely fashion, and -- and they're not sending them --\n Well, maybe something should be done about that.\n Yes, with the counties, perhaps. But another issue with the presentence report is it doesn't deal with in-prison behavior, and that's what the prison officials need a -- need time to take a look at, is how the inmate is going to react once they get in the prison environment, which is a wholly different environment than a jail environment.\n May I ask what's probably a stupid question? We're concerned, I suppose, about say, a black prisoner who's just coming into prison for the first time and you hope he won't join one of the black gangs. So wouldn't the safest thing to do for the first 20 days is to put him with a cellmate who's not black?\n No, Your Honor, because in prison the animosity between the gangs is purely race-based, and that inmate may be subjected --\n Between the gangs. But I'm assuming a new prisoner who you have no information about. Do you presume he's a member of a gang or presume he's somebody who may not be a member of a gang?\n There's not a presumption that the person is a member of the gang. But there is a presumption --\n Well, if he's not a member of the gang, isn't the danger that he'll become affiliated with the gang increased by insisting on putting him with the same race as -- as he is?\n That may be, but there is also a danger that if he is housed interracially and subjected to gang pressures on the yard, that he will then be in a situation to go back to his cell, when the door is closed and the lights are out, and commit violent acts upon his cellmate at -- because of pressures that he's receiving from members of his own race.\n Of course, you -- you have never -- no evidence that that's ever happened because you've never tried it.\n In the reception centers, no. The -- it has been a policy of not cross-racially housing the inmates in the cells only. That's correct, Your Honor.\n You -- you said a second ago that there's a significant difference between the conditions in the jails and the conditions in -- in the prisons. Is that significant difference the -- the organization of -- of racially based gangs in the prisons as distinct from the jails?\n Yes, I think that's true. And there's also a difference I think in the attitude of -- of the inmates when they're in -- in a state of flux in a jail as opposed to when they arrive to serve their many years-long sentence, in the case of Mr. Johnson, 37 years to life. And then I think the reality sets in and -- and things do change. Prison is very different.\n Apart from the gang situation, is there reason to think that their minds change in the sense of inclining them to interracial violence simply because they say, gee, I'm in for a long time?\n Yes, I -- I believe it is.\n And do we have any evidence to that effect?\n Well, the reality in prison is that people are pressured to join gangs and to -- you either hang with your own or you don't and --\n But that -- I mean, that goes back to the gang membership situation. It seems to me that's your strongest argument.\n Yes, it's true. But even for members -- people who are not actually members of the gang are subjected to the gang pressures. For instance, if -- if there was going to be a fight, a planned fight, that was going to break out on a yard, members of a prison gang would tell members of -- of their same race that once the fight breaks out, you better be with us because if you're not, we'll deal with you later. And that's even for people who aren't gang members. So the racial pressures in prison are very, very severe. Something --\n But it still seems to me that a new inmate is more likely to be subjected to that pressure with the -- his cellmates than with somebody out in the yard.\n And he may well be, Your Honor, but what --\n And it seems to me insurance against him joining a racial gang is cell -- cell him with somebody who's not of the same race.\n But you -- but to do that would be to invite danger to the -- to the other inmate. The -- the level of interracial violence in prison is high, and that can't be disregarded. And if we weren't here today --\n How does it compare to intraracial violence?\n There hasn't, as -- as we've talked about, been a problem with interracial violence in the cells because they're not housed that way. There are problems with --\n I mean --\n In general.\n -- overall.\n There are some problems with intraracial violence, but they're generally more founded in personal relations as opposed to a race-based -- you know, some other sort of animosity. The same sort of reasons that people have fights on the outside --\n But there -- is there any figures on the prison population as a whole, the incidents of interracial violence as opposed to intraracial violence?\n No, Your Honor. In this case there's -- it's not in the record.\n And do we know -- does this record tell us what happens after the 60 days? To what extent where there are double cells, does the same race policy, although not formally adopted, continue? After the 60 days, what is the incidence of different race double-celling and same race double-celling?\n What we do have in the record, Your Honor, is that the policy and the practice does not apply after the 60 days. Inmates are allowed to request a cell together and can choose their own cellmates so long as the other cellmate agrees.\n So we just don't have any information whether this line between the 60 days is imaginary.\n We do, Your Honor. The -- it is not -- it does not happen outside of the reception center cell practice. Once they get to their permanent housing assignment, they may choose their own cellmates.\n When -- when they do choose that, do you respect a choice to cell with -- with another member of -- of the -- of -- do you respect the choice when two members of a gang want to cell together?\n Two members of the same gang?\n Same gang.\n It -- it would depend on if they are -- what level of gang membership they are. California has a very complex system for what -- doing what they call validating gang membership. If they are a validated gang member, generally they are sent to a special prison, and yes, they are housed with members of their own gangs in a very high security setting.\n Do you -- do you have a -- do you have any record of -- of requests by different -- members of different gangs to cell together?\n We don't have any record of that, but I -- I can tell you that if members of opposing gangs were to request a cell together, first of all, they would both have to agree, which would be highly unlikely, and there -- it would probably be viewed with a bit of suspicion as to what was going on. But maybe if -- if they had disavowed their gang membership and -- and these particular people could get along, it would certainly be considered. The -- the object, once they get to the permanent housing, is cellmate compatibility. So there are a lot of things that are looked at.\n Ms. Grunder, do you agree with opposing counsel that even if evaluated under the Turner rule, properly applied, that California's policy would not survive?\n I do not agree with counsel. I believe that the Ninth Circuit did properly apply the Turner standard in this case and that California would pass and does pass the Turner test in this case.\n It wouldn't -- it wouldn't pass if -- would it, if we do not accept your argument that California cannot efficiently get records sent along with inmates so that, at the time at least of transfers, the prisons are in a position to know what they're getting? If we -- if we say, look, we're not going to accept the argument from administrative efficiency, then you can't survive Turner, can you?\n Well, it may be more than just administrative efficiency because every prison is different and there are different gang pressures at each prison. And I think it's important for the prison to be allowed an opportunity to bring that transferred inmate in and look at them and how they're going to fit into that prison and have a chance to evaluate their records. It's true that --\n Well, that's --\n I'm sorry, Your Honor.\n No. I don't want to cut your argument short, but here's what's bothering me. I -- I can see there's a possible plausibility in what you're saying, but in fact is that the reason? Is there any evidence in the record to the effect that that is necessary in transfer situations?\n The officials have deemed that that is an appropriate policy. I think the record is a bit scant in this case.\n Okay. Look, if -- if we accept that officials have deemed it, we will not have many arguments in -- in this Court. I mean, they will be over before they start. I -- I mean, we've got to have something more than simply the decision under attack. Is there anything more in this case in -- with respect to the transferee situation?\n Not with respect to the transferees, Your Honor, and it's true that the transfer policy certainly is more in jeopardy under the Turner standard. But the -- the overall policy of considering race when there is a -- a lack of information certainly would pass the Turner standard and should pass the Turner standard as it was properly applied by the Ninth Circuit.\n You said that --\n May I ask just one other question about the -- the purpose you're trying to achieve? Is it to protect the two inmates who are first celled together from fighting with one another, or is it to avoid the danger that one of them will somehow start a riot later on in -- in the general prison population?\n It's multi-fold, Your Honor.\n It's what?\n It's multi-fold. The purpose is multi-fold. First, yes, it is to protect the inmate from -- from having harm done to him in the cell, which is a very difficult area to protect. It's a small area and not easily visible into the -- into the cell directly. Also, that's where they sleep, so at some point the lights will be out. So it's a very difficult situation. Also, they're afraid -- and this is in the record from the testimony of the officials -- that there will be a ripple effect and that the interracial violence, if they were to cell them together, would spill out onto the yards and create the exact ripple effect that Turner -- is one of the considerations in the Turner test.\n There was something --\n May I ask -- excuse me. Go ahead. I want to ask one other question. You -- you mentioned the Texas system and you discussed it in your brief. Is that correct? I didn't find it in your discussion as to the Texas case.\n Yes, Your Honors, at page 41 of the brief. It would be the -- the second paragraph where they examine double-celling only after initial screening. And also note 13 of the Trulson study indicates that it did not apply in Texas' equivalent of California's reception centers. The Turner standard is the appropriate standard here because it does give the prison officials --\n Let -- let me ask --\n I'm sorry.\n -- about that standard at least as the Ninth Circuit applied it. They said that you presume the practice constitutional and the challenger has the burden to show that if there were no segregation by race, that violence would not increase. Now, how does someone go about proving that negative?\n Well, in this case the inmate put forth no experts of any kind. There was an opportunity for the inmate to rebut the evidence put forth by the prison officials, and -- and there was no evidence submitted. So in this case he didn't --\n But how would an inmate who was objecting to this racial segregation go about proving such a case? You said one would have to rely on experts.\n That would be one way, Your Honor.\n And so one could put in that Texas study, but you said that wouldn't be good enough.\n Well, the Texas study doesn't -- doesn't apply to the initial intake process.\n So you -- you -- supposing an inmate who would have to call a bevy of experts that he has no wherewithal to -- to pay for -- I mean, you are essentially saying an inmate cannot challenge this policy.\n No, Your Honor. Actually this policy was applied in a California case after the Johnson case was decided in California to strike down a race-based prison policy. So there -- there certainly are instances when the inmate could --\n Well, I asked how would an inmate prove this, and you said you would need experts. So for experts, you need money to pay experts. How does an inmate do that?\n Well, the same way the inmate would do it in any other litigation that is brought by an inmate. The burden is on a litigant to prove their case, and it doesn't change because that litigant is in prison.\n Now, why -- why should you use the Turner standard? The Turner standard says to the prison, you can do this as long as you have a modestly good reason. Strict scrutiny says you have to have a very good reason. With free speech, of course, people understand prisons are different. Of course, people's speech rights will be controlled and it won't hurt the rest of society. With racial discrimination, as you heard your opponents argue, it's a terrible symbol, a symbol that we would tolerate without the best of reasons discrimination, invidious discrimination, based on race, which is divisive to the whole society. Now, that they say is a very good reason for not applying the Turner standard but, rather, applying strict scrutiny, which gives you freedom to discriminate on this basis if you can prove you really have to.\n Unlike in a non-prison setting, there aren't other rights to be balanced. In the prison setting, not only are you balancing the inmate's right to be free from discrimination, but you're balancing the -- the rights of all inmates to be free from harm, and as well as the prison officials' duty to protect them from harm. And that is what --\n That -- that same argument could have made in -- in arguing about racial segregation in the schools and -- and in the military and everything else. That's -- that's not an acceptable answer.\n Well, there's -- there's no -- the prison officials here have an affirmative duty to protect the other inmates under the Eighth Amendment, and --\n Do you accept that this is invidious discrimination on the basis of race? What -- what -- why -- why do you think it's invidious?\n We don't think it's invidious, Your Honor. As a matter of fact --\n It's not affirmative action.\n This is not affirmative action, no. It is not invidious, Justice Scalia. It is simply one consideration of race to control violence in prison, and as the Bureau of Prisons uses in -- in its prisons, they in the United States' brief say that they consider race to maintain racial balance in their prisons for the purpose of diversity. California also considers race in maintaining racial balance in its prisons, not primarily for the purpose of diversity, but for prison safety to make sure that no one group takes over a prison, thus putting members of another group in a vulnerable situation. There are many circumstances when -- when race should be --\n Is that -- is that invidious?\n No, it is not, Your Honor.\n Is it affirmative action?\n No. There are many instances in which race needs to be considered on a day-to-day basis in prison. For instance, when the prisoners line up to go to the exercise yard, if 10 white prisoners line up first and the 11th prisoner in line is an African American, it would be extraordinarily ill-advised to release those prisoners in the manner in which they have lined up to go to yard. It would require some reshuffling and maybe even some shifting of prisoners from yard to yard based on their race because to do that would put the minority member at extreme risk. Turner is the appropriate test here because courts --\n I -- I -- this may -- may be important to me for understanding your argument. I -- I didn't quite understand the hypothetical. You -- you want him to keep the place in line or it's dangerous for him to keep the place in line?\n It would be dangerous for the officer to release the inmates onto the yard in the manner that they had self-arrayed because then you would put 10 members or more of one group on the yard and then introduce another member to the yard who was not a member of that group, and that would be very dangerous for the -- the sole person on the yard.\n And do -- do other prison systems adopt similar policies to try to keep the races mixed generally in --\n Yes, they do, Your Honor. As I pointed out, Bureau of Prisons being one. As a matter of fact, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Corrections Institute statistics -- and this is not a part of the record -- indicate that 96 percent of all States separate prisoners based on disruptive group or gang orientation. So California is not alone in that. It's a -- it's done to prevent violence to other prisoners. In sum, Turner is the only test that provides the flexibility that prison officials need to safely manage their prisons and protect inmates from harm. The Court should apply it here and affirm the lower court. Thank you.\n Thank you, Ms. Grunder. Mr. Deixler, you have about three and a half minutes.\n The -- the hypotheticals presented by the State of California, when applied in the context of this case, demonstrate the danger of this position of segregation. The petitioner in this case is not a gang member. He's been in the California prison system since 1987 and before. When he reported to the inmate reception center at Chino in 1987, he had already three presentence reports which are reflected in -- in the record of this -- of this case at the joint exhibit 259. He's been transferred five times since then -- since then. There's no record of his having had interracial violence ever during the time that he was in prison. And it is his view, as articulated in his deposition at page 109 of the joint appendix, that he is put into peril because he is an African American who is unable to cross race lines and unable to reach out for support in a heavily racialized setting for other persons who are not African Americans and who are not gang members. So he's been marginalized and treated, based upon his race, in a de jure way when he's transferred for the 60-day period. And incidentally, the reference to a 14-day period is not borne out by the record. The regulation in the State of California specifically provides that this organization or evaluation group has to convene within 14 days, but not have to reach a decision with regard to transfer characterization and classification in 14 days. But -- but the petitioner in this case, because he's black and has no opportunity to cell initially with a white person or a Hispanic person, is then confined to being in this small group of African Americans who are not gang members and who are unable to have an affinity group in which they will feel safe within the California prison system. The California --\n The same thing would happen to a white. It's not because he's black. I mean, this -- right? The same thing would happen to a white.\n Yes. A white --\n He'd be able to make the same argument.\n A white who, for reasons of safety, wished to house with an African American, would be denied that opportunity under California's policy, and the same with an Hispanic who felt it safer for him to house with a black. He could not cross racial lines based upon the evidence in this case, Justice Scalia. That's correct. And the danger which is created in my judgment by a reliance upon a Turner standard in this circumstance is that all that needs to be done is a little bit more of tinkering with the idea of the equivalence between race and gang which cannot exist in this record. And were that to happen, we will create a circumstance where the very arguments rejected in Lee, indeed the very argument advanced by the State of California in this case, will once again be raised time and again, and we will be faced with a circumstance not too far down the slippery slope where, for convenience or for other reasons or for purely invidious reasons, States will be able to return to an era of segregation. This Court's history has demonstrated a commitment to march the country away from the road of segregation, and there should be no turning back. This is a case in which the Ninth Circuit has erred. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be reversed. The Court should determine that strict scrutiny should apply, and it should determine that Petitioner Johnson's equal protection rights were violated.\n Thank you, Mr. Deixler. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit invalidated Mr. Alford's arrest and held the arresting officers in this case personally liable for damages based on the closely related offense doctrine. The doctrine is contrary to fundamental Fourth Amendment principles that probable cause is an objective inquiry based on all of the facts and circumstances known to the officer at arrest. In contrast, the closely related offense doctrine is a subject of inquiry that limits probable cause only to those facts and circumstances closely related to the offense that the arresting officer announces at arrest. Under the doctrine, then if two officers observe precisely the same facts and circumstances and arrest the suspect, the arrest in one case can be valid and in the other invalid based only on the officer's subjective legal evaluation --\n Ms. Hart, is there any requirement in Washington or generally that an officer state the grounds for the arrest to the person being arrested at the time?\n Justice O'Connor, there's no constitutional requirement and there is no requirement in -- in Washington that that be done. A number of States do require that it be done statutorily and many of those States also --\n We're dealing here with a case from the State of Washington, and you assert there is no such requirement in Washington.\n There is not.\n But in this case when the respondent was arrested, he was informed by the officer that the arrest was for making a tape recording of the conversation?\n That is correct.\n And it turns out -- do you concede that that was, in fact, not a lawful grounds for arrest?\n That -- at this point, the question of the --\n Do you concede that --\n Your Honor --\n -- that in the State of Washington, that it is perfectly lawful to record the conversation with the police?\n This -- the facts of this particular case have not been before a -- a court in Washington, Your Honor.\n But I'm asking you. What is your view? Is it lawful or not for an individual to record, tape record, the conversation with a policeman on the occasion of a stop?\n Your Honor, I believe in this case there would be probable cause for an officer to believe it was and therefore effect an arrest. I don't believe that the -- the question has been answered in Washington, and I believe there are good grounds to argue that it would be permissible and that, indeed, unlike the decision in State v. Flora, there were distinguishing circumstances here, including the absence of passers-by on the scene.\n Well, do we decide this case on the understanding that it was lawful to make the recording? Is that the basis in which we decide this case?\n No, Your Honor. We have not raised the Privacy Act as an issue before this Court.\n Well, for argument --\n Now, Washington also has an anti-stacking policy, does it?\n The State Patrol does, Your Honor, yes.\n Is -- is that just a rule of the patrolmen in the State?\n It --\n They won't arrest someone for several charges?\n It's an agency policy and troopers with the Washington State Patrol are trained to it.\n Well, is it an agency policy that the State endorses, and if so, why -- why do you endorse or adopt the policy?\n Well, Your Honor, I believe that -- that stacking charges really is -- there are good reasons to endorse the policy. One is that it's not a particular --\n Not -- not stacking charges you mean.\n I'm sorry. Not stacking charges, Your Honor, is -- is an -- a sound policy for a number of reasons. First, it's not a particularly effective or efficient use of law enforcement resources, but perhaps more importantly, it can have significant negative consequences for people who are subject to arrest in terms of their ability -- the amount of bail, their ability to post bail, and to secure a pre-trial release.\n Well, is that -- I mean, is that the -- the real basis for the policy, that we -- that Washington does not want to make it difficult for -- for arrestees to raise bail?\n Your Honor, I can't tell you precisely what the Washington State Patrol's thinking is on it. My impression is that, in part, they believe that -- that the appropriate law enforcement response is -- is to determine whether there's probable cause and to arrest and leave the sorting out of the charges to be pressed actually by the State to the prosecuting attorney.\n What do you make of the argument that unless the cause of the arrest is, number one, stated and, number two, a -- a cause that a defendant can rely on, that in any case like this in which the stated grounds of the arrest turn out to be -- we will assume, turn out to be inadequate, the police will always, particularly in traffic cases, be able to come up with something later on to justify the arrest? What -- what do you make of that argument?\n Well, I -- I think what I would make of it, Justice Souter, is that provided that there's probable cause for arrest, that the fact that there may be a basis to -- to stop a number of -- of motorists is not -- is not relevant. And in part, I believe that, for example, this Court's decision in Whren indicates that so long as there is probable cause for arrest, the reason for the --\n But that was for an -- an arrest in which, so far as we can tell, the -- the stated grounds for the arrest were those for which there was probable cause. And I think one of the concerns underlying the argument that I asked you to comment on is that if the -- if the police, in effect, have -- have discretion ad lib afterwards to come up with new grounds for the arrest, there's -- there's going to be a kind of a basic corrosion in the integrity of the arrest process and in the confidence of people to believe that the police are really acting in good faith when they make an arrest.\n Well, Your Honor, the -- if there is probable cause for arrest, that is the concern of the Fourth Amendment, and I -- I don't believe that the -- the concern -- I don't know that there's any empirical evidence that the concern that you are expressing has been borne out.\n That -- that may be -- that may be the -- the best response. And I take it, so far as you know, there -- there are no studies that have gone into this on an empirical basis. Is that correct, so far as you know?\n Not as -- as far as I know, Your Honor. But I would also suggest to you that the notion that an officer would effect an arrest without any basis for the arrest on a hope that a prosecuting attorney can come up with a basis for the arrest --\n No. The -- the argument is that he thinks he does have a ground. It turns out that he's wrong. Unless he is very unimaginative, he'll find another one. It's not that he arrests saying I have no basis to arrest this person, but I'll think of something later. It's -- it's the -- the problem is, I think -- or the argument, I think, is directed to a case like this.\n Well, and -- and Your Honor, I -- I do believe that the concern of the Fourth Amendment, which is the only constitutional provision at issue in this case, is that there in fact be a reasonable basis for arrest and that subsequently or promptly subsequently or prior to arrest be tested by a neutral magistrate. And that's the only concern.\n Ms. Hart, I'm -- I'm not sure what you mean by -- that there has to be probable cause for arrest. Do you mean objectively, or do you mean on the basis of the facts known to the arresting officer? I mean, let's -- let's assume an officer stops a car for a broken taillight, and it turns out the car doesn't have a broken taillight. All right? So that basis is wrong. However, the car also has an expired inspection sticker, which the officer didn't know about. Was there a probable cause for arrest, as you're using the term here?\n If there was probable cause based on the -- if there was reason based on the objective facts and circumstances --\n And it doesn't matter whether he knew those facts and circumstances.\n -- that -- known to the officer at arrest.\n Oh, so it has to be known.\n Yes.\n So in my example, the arrest would be invalid because at the time of the arrest, he didn't know about the sticker.\n Absent the circumstances at arrest giving rise to a reasonable basis to believe that a crime had been committed, there would not be probable cause.\n So you're saying it's the facts known to the officer --\n Precisely.\n -- that have to establish the probable --\n That's --\n Once -- once you establish that limitation, are you willing to accept the horrible that -- that Justice Souter proposed to you? Is it -- is it, indeed, so easy to -- to gin up some other cause for arrest when you used a mistaken cause? I don't know that it's all that easy.\n It is not and -- and -- it is not. And that was the -- the reason why I indicated in response to Justice Souter's question that I do believe that it is not all that easy. And I -- I believe that one of the foremost commentators in this area has termed that notion fanciful for the reason that it is -- it is stopping on a hope and a prayer that something will provide justification for that later --\n That was LaFave. You cited LaFave in your brief for that proposition.\n Yes.\n You -- you made the point, in answer to Justice O'Connor, that a police officer in Washington is not required to divulge on the spot the reason for the arrest. What is the point at which the arrestee under Washington law is entitled to know the cause of the arrest?\n At charging, Your Honor, there -- there -- the -- the individual who has been arrested, as a matter of the Sixth Amendment, would be entitled to know the charges against him or her, and the officer is required, in a warrantless arrest, to appear before a neutral magistrate and have the probable cause for the arrest tested --\n Is it -- is it at the arraignment or the -- at the earlier booking in the police station?\n I'm sorry. I'm not following your question.\n Is it -- is it -- is the time when the arrestee must told you are being arrested for X reason, is that when the arrestee appears before the magistrate or is it earlier when he's brought into the police station and he's booked? The arrest is booked. At which point?\n Neither, Justice Ginsburg. The arrestee would be entitled constitutionally to know the charge against him or her when criminal -- a criminal prosecution is commenced by charging. For the most part, that is done in Washington by an information or a charge filed by a prosecuting attorney.\n You mean he could be held until a charge is filed without being told why he's being held?\n Justice Stevens --\n So that could be a week or 2.\n But it would be -- he would be held in that case following a determination by a neutral magistrate that there are grounds to hold him. And at that point --\n Would the magistrate keep those grounds secret?\n They would not be secret, Your Honor, no.\n Well, wouldn't the magistrate tell him why he's being held?\n The magistrate would tell the -- the arrestee why he's being held, provided the arrestee is present for that particular procedure.\n And how soon is he entitled to appear before the magistrate?\n I'm sorry?\n How soon after his physical arrest does he have a right to appear before the magistrate?\n My -- my recollection under Washington's law would be -- 72 hours is the time for the charge.\n So for 72 hours, he could be held incommunicado without knowing why he was arrested.\n But -- but for that period, the arresting officer would have had to -- during the 48-hour period at the outset, that this Court discussed in Riverside, the probable cause for the arrest would be tested by a neutral magistrate.\n You also said that you thought this case is distinguishable on the legitimacy of taping the conversation with the police officer on the highway. Why -- why do you think this is distinguishable from the Washington Intermediate Appellate Court decision that the -- that the -- that Alford wanted to show to the police officer?\n Well, first of all, again, Justice Ginsburg, the Privacy Act issue is not one that we have raised before this Court. But -- but the reason that I would suggest it is distinguishable is that in a subsequent case considered by the Washington State Supreme Court called State v. Clark, the court look at Flora, the Intermediate Appellate Court case, and -- and termed it as a case that said you do not have a private conversation when it is open to passers-by. And in Flora, there was another individual present at the scene and who was, in fact, subsequently arrested for interfering with the arrest in the Flora case. So there is, all I'm suggesting, at least some grounds for distinguishing the Flora case for that reason.\n Do you know if there's been any instruction in the State of Washington to police following that Flora decision about taping -- about arresting people for taping conversations with police officers?\n I do believe there has, Your Honor. It's not a matter of record, however, in the -- against arresting for that reason.\n The flashing headlights which was -- there was a citation. There was an arrest for the tape recording and a citation for the flashing headlights. Could there have been a -- an arrest for the flashing headlights, or is that a lesser category of offense that's not an arrestable offense?\n Under Washington law, the flashing headlights, the wig-wag lights, in and of themselves would not be an arrestable offense. It would be a citable offense. The impersonating offense involved in this case would be arrestable, and the wig-wag headlights would play a part in that, however.\n But he was never -- never charged with the impersonating an officer, only with the flashing headlights. Is that right?\n That's correct.\n The -- the case, as far as I'm thinking of it at the moment, comes down to everybody is agreeing -- well, no. It's -- you go ahead because you want to reserve that probably.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n Mr. Comey.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The validity of a police action under the Fourth Amendment turns upon an objective assessment of the facts viewed through the prism --\n Do the facts, on your view, have to be known to the officer?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Is -- is there -- and correct me if I'm wrong. In -- in cases in which we're inquiring into probable cause for a warrantless search, we give the government credit for any fact known to any officer, don't we?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Why wouldn't we have the same rule? Why shouldn't we have the same rule with respect to facts known to any officer when one officer makes an arrest?\n I suspect, Your Honor, that the Government would urge such a rule if it were at issue in case.\n But it's not urging it here.\n Well, I don't see it at -- at issue in this case, Your Honor.\n I don't think it is. I just want to know where we're going.\n That's -- that's correct, Your Honor. The -- the Government's position, as with the State of Washington's position, is that the -- the analysis is simply did the facts known to the officer, viewed through the prism of an objectively reasonable officer, establish probable cause. And that to make an evaluation of the arrest turn upon the officer's subjective assessment of those facts -- in other words, the working of his brain, the crunching of those facts that results in the spitting out of a legal conclusion -- is contrary to this Court's precedent and guts the objective reasonable test, and would make, instead, the validity of a Fourth Amendment action turn upon whether the officer is particularly smart, whether he's new, whether he's nervous, whether he says nothing at all or whether he decides to say, you're under arrest for everything listed in the Washington code book. Under those circumstances, the results would be different. The -- the concern that Your Honor raised about police officers engaging in a post hoc rationalization I respectfully suggest is not a concern that is rooted in reality because the facts continue to drive the analysis. Whether or not a police officer is right at the arrest scene in invoking a particular statute, if that turns out to be incorrect, it is still the facts that were known to him that must support probable cause for some other offense.\n So far as you know, there -- there are no empirical studies looking into this particular horrible?\n No, I'm not aware of any, Your Honor. I also suggest that if this were the concern that the Ninth Circuit were looking to address by the closely related offense doctrine, the remedy sweeps far too broadly in both directions. It punishes officers who at the scene engage in remarkable good faith conduct. I mean, these two police officers I think are what the public would hope these police officers were, looking at a code book at the roadside, calling a prosecutor late at night, trying to get it right. They are punished under this doctrine. Those that are rewarded are those who are smart enough, perhaps a veteran, perhaps someone who has read the Ninth Circuit's cases, to stay completely silent, to say nothing at all, knowing that he's going to be fine. He needs to engage in no --\n Mr. Comey, I think you rely, in part at least, on this Court's case in Whren --\n Yes, Your Honor.\n -- for the result for which you argue. But in Whren, the stated reason for the stop, traffic enforcement, was lawful, and we didn't have to look any further. In this case, the stated reason I think we assume, at least according to the trial judge's instruction to the jury, was unlawful. Does that impair the reliance on Whren?\n I don't believe it does, Your Honor. I believe that what Whren teaches is that the subjective working of the police officer's mind, his motives, his intentions, his legal assessments, as in other cases, his legal assessment with respect to the extent of a consent to search, or the reason he's boarding a boat, is irrelevant, that that's for courts to do. What matters is what came into an officer's brain, not what came out as a result of his working on it. Because, as I said, that would make law enforcement far from unevenhanded. It would make it depend upon who the officer was at the roadside on any given night. And those similarly situated would be treated very, very differently, depending upon what an officer chose to say. And as I said, silence in a -- in a jurisdiction that's governed by the closely related offense doctrine is the best course.\n But if -- if we had gone the other way in Whren, we would still have the problem that we have in this case, wouldn't we? Regardless of -- of how an arrest would be justified, the issue here is are the grounds of justification limited to the reason and in most cases the stated reason for the arrest. So we'd have this problem even if Whren had -- had come out otherwise, wouldn't we?\n I think we would still be discussing whether the subjective functioning of an officer's mind is relevant for Fourth Amendment purposes, which turns upon whether the action was reasonable in the case of an arrest --\n But the question here is the scope of the Fourth Amendment inquiry. Can it take in probable cause for reasons other than the reason for the arrest or the stated reason for the arrest? Can it consider other offenses, and we'd have that regardless of -- of Whren, wouldn't we?\n I think we would, Your Honor, to the extent that Whren is about motives and this case is about something very closely related, still the inner working of an officer's mind, what legal conclusion he draws from facts.\n Why is it subjective? I mean, in -- in Whren, the question was finding a hidden motive as distinguished from the motive that was written out. Here, there's nothing subjective about what the officer charged this person with on the spot. He told him. There wasn't anything hidden in his mind. He said, I'm arresting you for X reason, for tape recording. And then they had a whole colloquy. So what the -- what the arrest was for is as objective as it can be.\n I would suggest, Your Honor, that his speaking, his invocation of a particular code section is an objective manifestation of an essentially subjective process. And that's illustrated by imagining three stops on that road that night, three Mr. Alfords, exact same facts. In one, the officer is engaged in the process that he engaged in here. In the other two, the officer chooses in the first to say nothing, and in the third, to say -- hold up the code book and say what you did is in here. Everything in here applies to you, wise guy. Now get in the car. In those two other circumstances, complete silence and the table of contents approach, we wouldn't be here. These officers would not have been in litigation for 4 years. That to me demonstrates that it is essentially subjective because it is driven not by the facts, what the defendant did, but by the nature of the police officer. Is he clever? Has he gone to law school at night?\n But, of course, even in those examples, there could be a difference in what the police officer had actually observed. He might not have seen the safety sticker or the taillight or whatever it is. So you do have some inquiry into the mental processes of the officer in every case.\n Yes, Your Honor. And -- and if -- perhaps my distinction is -- is too homely, but I would say that's about what comes into his mind, into the brain, his senses. Did he see this taillight? Did he see the sticker? Not what comes out of his mouth as a result of the functioning of that brain, his legal brain. The legal work is for the courts looking at an arrest that's been challenged through the prism of an objectively reasonable officer. It does not depend, else Fourth Amendment seizures would be not reasonable, but would vary depending upon the skills of an individual officer from roadside to roadside. And that is utterly inconsistent with this Court's precedent and would, in fact, gut the objective reasonableness test. The Ninth Circuit's rule would lead to dramatically uneven law enforcement. It would, indeed, lead to either stacking or silence, and there's plenty of good reason why an officer or a Federal agent, who are not required to say anything at arrest, might want to inform a defendant of a basis for his arrest and might want to uphold other bases for an arrest, to protect a witness, for example. To drive police officers to the extremes is not in the public interest.\n You -- you predicted that this would be in practice very bad. There are some jurisdictions that have the closely related test, are there not?\n Yes, Your Honor. The Ninth Circuit.\n But the -- outside the Ninth Circuit.\n Yes, Your Honor. I believe the Seventh Circuit as well and the First Circuit.\n Do we know whether these horribles have occurred there, that the police are booking for everything?\n I do not, Your Honor. I -- I know with Federal agents, Federal agents say nothing. They're required to say nothing. They simply bring a defendant in on a warrantless arrest, cuff him, leave him in the cellblock, and then the assistant U.S. attorneys take the matter before a magistrate. So there is -- and that's one of the things that demonstrates the unworkability of this test because there are plenty of jurisdictions, thousands of Federal agents, who are under no obligation to say anything. And so it's hard to see how this test, even to the extent there were a concern about the evil or perceived evil of post hoc rationalization, which I suggest there isn't, this -- how this test would be applied --\n In -- in the Federal system, is the arrest based on what the officer knew and -- and see -- and saw at the time?\n Yes, Your Honor. His perceptions, the -- the facts known to the arresting officers.\n Suppose he had asked for a gun permit and he sees the gun permit, and he said, well, it's -- that's okay. You've got the permit, but I'm going to arrest you for reckless driving. Then he finds out the driving charge is no good. It can't stand. But then they look at his wallet more carefully and they see the permit is expired. What -- what rule then? At the police station, they -- they see the permit is expired. In other words, they find out a fact after -- after they arrested him.\n Well, I -- I would suspect that any statements made or seizures made pursuant to the arrest, which was made on facts known to the officers, that did not include what was in his wallet would be in jeopardy. That -- you still might be able to prosecute him, but you'd have to work awful hard to save anything you got as a result of that arrest.\n So you would confine the rule to what the officer has seen at the time of the arrest.\n Facts known to the officers, including facts known to officers with whom he or she is working. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Thank you, Mr. Comey. Mr. Phillips.\n Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: In essence, the closely related offense doctrine enforces the reasonableness clause by precluding officers from arresting someone for non-criminal conduct. At its core, that's what this is about. Mr. Alford was arrested for conduct that was not --\n Well, I thought at its core it was about this rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted about closely related offenses. I thought at its core that's what we were concerned with.\n Well, Your Honor, the closely related offense doctrine itself is -- it's in five circuits -- six depending on how you count the cases. But it's designed to -- to look at two things: number one, whether the arrest itself is reasonable; and number two, from a qualified immunity standpoint, whether -- essentially it's a no harm/no foul rule. If the conduct for which the person was arrested is criminal, but the officer merely has a mistake in terminology -- he calls it driving while license suspended instead of reckless driving -- then it actually salvages the arrest for law enforcement.\n Well, what if the arresting officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day, that indeed there were objective facts that would have justified an arrest. It wasn't what the officer had in mind but he didn't say anything. What result then?\n Your Honor, that -- that implicates several other rights. Number one, it is -- while an officer could, in some jurisdictions, effectuate a warrantless arrest without stating a basis therefor --\n Well, could -- could an arrest made under the circumstances I described be valid?\n I hate to say this, Your Honor, but it depends because at some point, for example, when the person is brought before the magistrate for the probable cause determination, they're not operating in a vacuum. There will have to be --\n No. At that time, there does. But we're talking about at the time of arrest. And it -- it just -- if the closely related offense doctrine has the effect of punishing an officer for explaining to the suspect a reason for the arrest, why is that a good doctrine? I mean, if the officer could say nothing and could end up, at the end of the day, having a valid arrest, I just think the closely related doctrine doesn't serve a very good purpose.\n Your Honor, the -- in this case, of course, that's -- that's not the -- that's not this case because the officer was very clear. He said exactly what it was for, and then he -- when he booked him, Officer Haner even booked him for illegal recording. So in this case, we're -- we're not presented with a vacuum. But even in an instance where the officer did not state at the instant of the arrest why he was arresting the person, one of the benefits of this doctrine is that it would allow for an objective review of the facts in order to determine --\n Well, if the objective review shows that there were, indeed, facts that would have justified an arrest, then what's wrong with allowing that to proceed?\n Your Honor, the -- the danger of that is that allowing this, as -- as I termed it, a general right of arrest with -- with no articulated basis at any point up until charging runs contrary to some of the basic principles --\n Okay. What's -- what's happening here is in order to avoid the down side of your test -- as Justice O'Connor puts it, her point is that if we adopt your rule, there's going to be an incentive not to state the reason. Now, in order to avoid that -- you haven't really squarely confronted it -- I think you're suggesting that there has to be an additional rule that the police officer must say why he's arrested, and -- and the authorities just don't establish that. Now, if you want us to go on and make up that rule, I suppose we could make up that rule.\n I'll be very happy if you --\n And I'm -- I'm sure you'd be delighted. But that's not the case we're confronted with. And if the choice is between making up a new rule to make your test work or rejecting your test, it seems to me that the -- that the latter might be the preferred course.\n Well, Your Honor, to sort of piggyback on what Justice Souter and what Justice Ginsburg had commented on, there's no empirical evidence to suggest that there is or would be a movement by police officers towards silence. There is simply nothing out there that says that police officers have in the past in the six jurisdictions, the six circuits that use this. There's no evidence that they have remained silent in an effort to --\n Must -- must be very stupid police officers. I mean, it's -- it's just obvious what -- what you have to do to make a valid arrest. If you say nothing, any -- any basis that you could have had for the arrest will -- will be used. Whereas, if you -- if you mention something, you better be able to substantiate that particular cause or a closely related crime. Police officers aren't any dumber than the rest of us. I can't believe that -- that that wouldn't be the -- the consequence of -- of the rule you're asking us to adopt.\n Your Honor --\n To put it this way, it seems to me the burden should be on you to -- to tell us why a police -- police officers are so stupid that they -- that they go around and -- and continue to give reasons when that's -- when that's going to make it more difficult for them to sustain the arrest and subject them to -- to personal liability.\n Well, for the most part, Justice Scalia, it does not come back to haunt the officers because the vast majority of arrests are lawful. The vast majority of officers have probable cause for the thing that they arrest the person for, and they arrest him for criminal conduct.\n But if they're told in this case that they're subject to 1983 liability out of their own pockets if they get it wrong, then it seems to me they would pursue the safe course and say nothing. I mean, you did say at one point in your brief that when a warrantless arrest is effected, the officer must inform the arrestee of the officer's authority and cause of arrest. But that's not true on the spot as a matter of Washington law or constitutional law, is it?\n The issue of -- of the constitutionality of that has never been ruled on by this Court. There are --\n Well, you're not urging that the Constitution requires the officer on the spot to state the cause of the arrest, or are you?\n Personally, Your Honor, I think that that would -- that would certainly comport more with the common law that was extant at the time the Constitution was --\n Well, regardless if it -- whether it comports with the common law, I don't see why the rule that you are urging, closely related, is going to make a dime's worth of difference unless ultimately we hold that there is an obligation to state the cause at the time of the arrest.\n Because, Your Honor, even if the -- even if the cause of the arrest is not stated at the time of the arrest, the person must be booked for something. There's a -- a report that's generated. In this instance --\n Okay. The booking occurs after arrest, and I thought what we were concerned with in this case was the validity of the arrest, not the booking.\n Correct, Your Honor.\n Okay. Now, if -- if the -- if the -- if it is the validity of arrest, which -- which is in issue, I don't see why your rule is going to make any difference in the long run unless we go the further step and say, in order to make this work, i.e., enforce Fourth Amendment values, at the time of the arrest the cause has got to be stated. Am -- am I missing something?\n Well, Your Honor, I would analogize it to the -- the arrest rule. Whether someone is or is not under arrest from a Fourth Amendment standpoint is based on an objective test, and it is viewed after the fact.\n Well, based on an objective test, we'll get absolutely nowhere. The person who is arrested is not in a position to be making objective or subjective assessments, by and large. He probably knows what he's being arrested for because it's obvious, but then we have cases like this, which are the only ones that are going to be litigated, and he may not know. The -- the fact still, it seems to me, is obvious. If we go your way, we're going to have to go the further step of requiring the cause to be stated. Isn't that, as a matter of common sense, true?\n It would certainly make it easier, but it's not necessary.\n All right. I'll be candid with you. I think it is necessary. But the -- I guess the -- what I'm getting at in all of this is you're asking us to take steps to solve a problem, and I don't think you've demonstrated what the problem is. We keep coming back, as we have several times, to the lack of empirical studies. Have we got something to worry about in -- in enforcing Fourth Amendment values that we can only guard against if we go your way?\n Well, Your Honor, I would say that the fact that there are six circuits that have adopted this policy shows that this is -- that this is a problem that occurs nationwide.\n Then what is the -- yes, but what's the justification for doing it? What is the practical problem that we are concerned with?\n The practical problem is that people are being arrested for conduct that is, at its base, not criminal.\n But they should have been arrested. I mean, so long as they should have been arrested, who cares? In this case, I mean, it'll -- it'll be ultimately be tried by a jury I -- I guess, but your -- your client pulls up behind another car with wig-wag lights flashing, like a police car. Right? He has a police scanner on the seat next to him. He has handcuffs. He has tinted glass in front of the license plate -- of his license plate, so it can't be -- can't be read. It seems to me there was obvious probable cause to -- to arrest this fellow for impersonating a police officer. And I would have hoped he would have been arrested so he wouldn't go around and -- and pull up behind another car. What is the problem?\n Well, Your Honor --\n It seems to me he should have been arrested, and the -- and the mere fact that the police officer gave the wrong reason for arresting him doesn't make me feel very bad about the arrest at all. I'm glad he was arrested.\n I'm going to disagree on two points. First, at the trial court, the State did not argue that he could have been arrested for other crimes. The jury was never instructed on the elements of these supposed other crimes. And we pointed that out in the appeal in the reply brief.\n Yes, but did you object to the instructions in the trial court?\n No, Your Honor, because the --\n One of the problems I have with the case, very frankly, is that the jury has already ruled against your client on the qualified immunity issue carrying out instructions given by the judge that were not objected to by your client.\n That's correct, Your Honor, but the only instructions that were given regarding -- regarding what they needed to find to find a violation were the Privacy Act instructions.\n But whose fault is that?\n Well, Your Honor, I think if the State wanted them to -- qualified immunity is an affirmative defense. If they wanted the State to find -- if they wanted the jury to find there was impersonation, they should have requested an instruction on that because impersonation in Washington requires more than simply taking an action that creates an impression that you're an officer. It also -- under first degree, there has to be specific intent to defraud someone, and here the only thing he did, he gave them a flashlight and helped them jack up their car. On the issue of the wig-wag headlights, the transcript shows that the officer spent a minute or 2, by his own estimation, on the scene behind Mr. Alford's car, saw no wig-wag headlights. And as for the scanner, the -- the transcript, page 246 -- he admitted at trial it was actually a ham radio, not a portable police scanner.\n But I thought that the reason that the police went after your client after he left the vehicle that was disabled was because the officers at that point suspected that he might be impersonating a police officer. That's what the people in the -- the disabled vehicle told the officer. They said he had flashing headlights. We thought he was a police officer. And -- and wasn't the original following of your client triggered by the suspicion that he might be impersonating a police officer?\n Yes, Your Honor, and that -- that -- we have not argued that there was not suspicion sufficient to -- to have a stop to do investigation. However, under the Washington statute, there was not evidence sufficient to show probable cause that there was an actual crime --\n Under Washington law, is it lawful for your client to have headlights -- wig-wag lights?\n No, Your Honor. It is a traffic violation. That is a non-arrestable offense, and that was admitted at court and also here today.\n Was your client ever found guilty of any offense at all?\n No, Your Honor. Even the traffic infraction was dismissed by the judge.\n But it's unlawful to have wig wag lights, and I take it it's an arrestable offense to impersonate a police officer.\n Yes, Your Honor, but that --\n So that would -- that would certainly be probable cause to arrest just based on the wig-wag, plus the fact he lied to the police in -- in instructing them the button to push or didn't tell them what button to push to make them go.\n No, Your Honor. The obstruction charge also under Washington law -- under the case law interpreting the statute, there has to not only be the -- the hindrance or obstruction. There has to be specific intent, and there has to be obstruction in fact. And in this case, both of the officers testified that they -- that he pushed every button they asked him to. He opened the hood for them. He let them look at the -- the flasher unit. He showed them the manual. They both say that they saw this button that after the arrest they pushed -- one of them pushed. However, there's obviously no obstruction in fact if -- one of them actually said at trial that he didn't ask him to push the button because he wanted to see whether he would push it or not. So there's no -- again, there's no facts to support a finding of probable cause even on the obstruction because the officers were essentially just letting him hang himself.\n Well, that -- that isn't the issue before us here. I -- I assume that for purposes of the question on which we granted certiorari, we have to assume, or else the whole thing doesn't make any sense and it's all -- it's all arguing about nothing -- we have to assume that there was probable cause on some other ground than the ground which he stated or anything closely related to the ground which -- which the officer stated. Isn't that -- isn't that the -- the manner in which this case gets to us?\n Your Honor, we raised the issue at the Ninth Circuit that there had been no evidence put forward on the other crimes. And we pointed out that even the deputy prosecuting attorney -- and in fact, even in closing argument, when they addressed the -- the wig-wag headlights, et cetera, they stated specifically that that information went to what they called his intent to unlawfully record.\n But -- but that's not the ground on which the Ninth Circuit decided it. The Ninth Circuit never had to reach the question of whether there was probable cause on these other grounds --\n Correct, Your Honor.\n -- because it found, even if there was these other grounds, they're not closely related to the illegal taping. So I suppose you're telling us that if we find that we do not like the closely related rule, that it's not part of -- of United States constitutional law, what we should do is remand to the Ninth Circuit so that they could determine whether there was probable cause on the other grounds.\n That's exactly right, Your Honor. And in -- in looking at this -- this probable cause determination and the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the qualified immunity, of course, was a doctrine that was advanced by the Court to address specific problems. None of those problems are impacted in any way by the closely related offense, this subset of qualified immunity cases.\n May I ask one other question about the proceedings in the trial court?\n Yes, sir.\n Was there a motion for summary judgment by the defendants claiming, as a matter of law, they should be entitled to qualified --\n Yes, sir.\n And that was overruled.\n That was denied, yes.\n And then there was a jury trial and the jury disagreed with it and, in effect, said there -- there was basis for qualified immunity.\n Yes. Yes, Justice Stevens. And the -- in reviewing the transcript and in reviewing the -- the instructions and the ruling on the summary judgment motion, the reason that Senior Judge Bryan did not rule on the qualified immunity was twofold. One, at the time of the summary judgment motion, one of the officers was -- well, was lying about having contacted the prosecutor prior to making the arrest, and he noted in his order that there was a factual dispute. So summary judgment wasn't appropriate. And second, Judge Bryan indicated that essentially there was a problem created by the Saucier opinion because he felt that it was somehow possible that there could have been an arrest effectuated without probable cause, but that there was a reasonable mistake on the part of the officers. So this did not proceed to the jury on the -- on this closely related offense doctrine. It didn't proceed on there were these other crimes for which probable cause existed, but on this broad standard of good faith and reasonable mistake.\n What is your understanding of the reason for the jury's verdict on this issue?\n I almost hate to say it, Your Honor, but I believe it was a lack of sympathy. That -- that is my -- much like with Justice Scalia, I believe they -- they looked at the -- the circumstances and even though there was not probable cause to have arrested him, they came to the conclusion we don't like Mr. Alford. We're not going to find for him.\n May I ask one other question then too?\n That's not my reason. I don't even know the man. I'm just -- (Laughter.)\n In -- in your view is the closely related doctrine a -- a matter of closely related as a matter of law between two different offenses or is it a matter of -- are the facts relevant? For example, could one argue that these offenses were factually related pretty closely because they grew out of the same central group of facts?\n In our brief, Your Honor, I often used the phrase same conduct test because in amalgamating the six different circuits, that appeared to be the most consistent test and the one that's most consistent with the objective standard and with the reasonableness standard, that if -- and I, again, go to the no harm/no foul. If you're engaging in conduct that would have and should have led to your arrest, if it's the same conduct for which you were arrested and it's simply misnamed, then there essentially is no harm of constitutional magnitude. But otherwise --\n Well, then you have a very narrow view of closely related. It comes down to misnomer cases. It's one thing to say -- what the officers told the DA, although after they arrested him -- didn't they describe the whole episode from when they saw Alford pull up behind the disabled vehicle? They described that and they mentioned the flashing lights. They described the whole episode up till the point where they -- the officers apprehended him and saw the equipment and then noticed -- they told the DA everything, and he said, yes, you have probable cause.\n They did describe the entire episode to him, Justice Ginsburg.\n So why couldn't it be related in time and space rather than legally related?\n Well, I'm not urging something as narrow as -- as a semi-Blockburger test. But here you have essentially two discrete conducts that were being examined by the officers: number one, the actions surrounding the headlights; and number two, the actions surrounding the taping. And the trial -- I mean, it was very clear that the two were treated as discrete incidents by the police. At the moment Devenpeck saw the tape recorder -- and he testified at trial. When I saw the recorder in the record mode and saw that it was moving, that's what he stated to him constituted probable cause for the arrest. The moment he saw that tape recorder and saw the play and record buttons were pushed, he informed Mr. Alford, you're under arrest for making an illegal tape recording. So when looking at whether something is -- is sufficiently related or not, obviously there's going to have to be more than a modicum of logic that's used, but objectively this separates rather nicely into two discrete incidents for the analysis.\n Why -- why is it exactly that a policeman who comes on a difficult scene, gun in one pocket, the guy has a knife in another, and he throws a punch? Now, the policeman might make a mistake about that. He -- he thought he threw a punch, but he made a mistake. Now -- now, why is a policeman less likely to make that kind of a mistake than make a mistake about what crime to label it?\n Well, Your Honor, we're not concerned so much -- this doctrine is not concerned so much with what to label the crime.\n No, no. You said -- you -- you say everybody agrees in this case that if the policeman had reasonable cause objectively to arrest the person for A, but he arrested him for B instead, there are some circumstances in which that's okay. And on their view, it's -- as long as -- it was always okay, really, as long as objectively there was reasonable cause. On your view, you're going to add a little thing. You're going to add, and by the way, it's not okay unless that conduct that he looked at was in fact illegal. So you say -- because policemen could make mistakes about labels, but they're not likely to make mistakes about throwing a punch. So I just wondered why not. I mean, they got the wrong guy for throwing the punch. You know, so -- so what? Why is that so -- that -- that supposedly in your view is some terrible constitutional harm, but if he just mislabels it, it's not a terrible constitutional harm. And I'm just puzzled as to where that distinction comes from and why.\n Well, Your Honor, the distinction in -- in this particular case and the distinctions in the -- in the cases that run the gamut around the circuits generally show one thing that we --\n -- that the circuits all agree with you. Now, my only problem is it's hard for me to see why they all agree with you. (Laughter.)\n And -- and that's where I'm sort of stuck.\n Your Honor, if we start with first principles, and the first principle that underlies this case is there is, from the framing area -- era, a general mistrust of warrantless arrests. From that, we step to the reasonableness clause. From the reasonableness clause, we then step to this judicially created qualified immunity, which subsumed the good faith analysis. So what we find is we're stepping further and further away from the original principle. And the -- on the original principles, he was arrested without a warrant. Wrong. Under the Constitution we have reasonableness. Okay. He's arrested. Was it a reasonable arrest? The court has said we generally say that if an arrest has probable cause, then it's reasonable unless there are these exigent circumstances, excessive force, et cetera. Then under qualified immunity, it's even a step more attenuated, that even though there might not have been probable cause, if there was arguable probable cause, then there would be a violation, but no one is going to be liable for it.\n Yes, but Mr. Phillips, let me go back first principles. You are complaining about an arrest which you admit was valid. Do you not -- do -- do you not that the arrest was supported by probable cause and therefore was a valid arrest?\n In this instance, Your Honor?\n Yes.\n Certainly not.\n Oh, I misunderstood. I thought we were just talking about qualified immunity. But you challenge the arrest itself even though you admit there was probable cause for the arrest?\n No, Your Honor, because we don't feel that there was probable cause for the arrest.\n We don't that challenge that here, though. I asked you that question earlier, and I thought you agreed that for purposes of our deciding this case, we -- we will assume, though you do not concede the point, that there was probable cause on one of the other grounds.\n That in order to address the Ninth Circuit's holding --\n Exactly, exactly.\n And -- and there's no need for the Ninth Circuit's rule unless there was probable cause because if there was no probable cause, you win on that ground. You don't have to get into this closely related offense doctrine. Is that correct?\n If there was probable cause --\n No. If there was no probable cause.\n Oh, correct. If there was no probable cause for --\n Then you win without this fancy doctrine.\n That's -- that is correct, Your Honor, and that was --\n This -- this doctrine only comes into play and is only required in cases involving a valid arrest and a -- a mistake by the officer in identifying the wrong cause for the arrest. So it's an extension of the qualified -- it's a -- it's a -- an application of the qualified immunity doctrine to say you are not protected even though you acted lawfully.\n Well, because it actually -- to turn it back around, you're not protected because you did not act lawfully. You did not act lawfully because --\n No, but if you say the arrest was valid, he did act lawfully although we didn't realize the reason why he did.\n Your Honor, the cases that have examined this doctrine have -- have looked at it as sort of straddling the Fourth Amendment and the qualified immunity analysis.\n But -- but don't you reconcile the -- the problem of the straddle by saying that unless the probable cause, which we will assume existed, is for a closely related offense, the whole arrest was invalid?Isn't that your position?\n Correct. Unreasonable.\n Okay. Now, let me ask you -- you one other question. You -- you started out in getting down to first principles with disfavor of warrantless arrests. Would your position be different if the officer had somehow gotten an arrest warrant on the spot for illegal taping? Wouldn't you be making the same argument?\n Certainly, Your Honor, and there we would --\n So it has nothing to do, essentially, with warrantless or nonwarrantless arrests.\n Well, in this case it does, but had there been a warrant --\n Well, in this -- yes, but on your theory, that is -- that is incidental. That is not essential. If he had had an arrest warrant for illegal taping, you'd be making the same argument.\n That there was no probable cause for the arrest.\n That's -- that's right.\n Correct, Your Honor.\n And I think that that -- of course, that -- as we point out in our brief, there's support for that, that historically the warrant must show the reason that someone is being arrested. So as we pointed out, there's this -- an odd --\n Well, you don't have any case law to cite to us for that. That gets us into a whole new doctrine.\n Well, Your Honor, I think one of the most fundamental principles that we can look at on showing the reason why you're being arrested is the great writ of habeas corpus where, in order to hold someone, they must show why he is being held.\n But you've already conceded that it -- Washington law doesn't require the officer on the spot to say why he's making the arrest and that there's no decision of this Court or any court that I know that said the Constitution requires the officer on the spot to give a reason.\n That's correct, Your Honor. So what we have posited and what the Ninth Circuit -- what they did in the Gasho case, for example, is after the fact you can look at the actions that were taken by the officers, the booking sheet, et cetera, to give you some objectively verifiable evidence of the cause for the arrest. And really what it's looking at is there needs to be a nexus between conduct and arrest, and --\n Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Hart, you have 5 -- 5 minutes.\n I think I'd only like to make one point, Your Honors, and that is that the Fourth Amendment does not make the validity of arrest a game that the government loses even when there's probable cause for arrest, but the closely related offense doctrine does. And for that reason, it should be rejected and we respectfully ask the Court to reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit.\n Thank you, Ms. Hart. The case is submitted.\n We'll hear argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States. Ms. Brill.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: There are five primary reasons why this prosecution is outside the scope of anything Congress has authorized. First, the government's interpretation of the wire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule. Second, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by allowing the Government to incarcerate petitioners for 57 months for conduct that has never given rise to civil liability in this country. Third, this prosecution contravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity in matters of international tax enforcement. Fourth, the Government acknowledged below that it cannot bring this prosecution without disregarding another act of Congress, the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which is, as the name specifies, mandatory. And, fifth, under this Court's decisions in McNally and Cleveland, the wire fraud statute applies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into relinquishing something that it holds as money or property. A sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax claim is neither money nor property.\n Well, can you look at the interest of the Government as one of not allowing U.S. territory to be used to carry out a smuggling scheme? I mean, why does it have to be viewed as one of trying to enforce some other nation's tax laws?\n Justice O'Connor, the government's interest in prosecuting somebody does not define the scope of what the statute at issue proscribes.\n It's a wire fraud statute dealing with the use of communications capacity in this country to carry out a scheme designed to enable smuggling of goods.\n Well, if the -- if the statute was not written as it is -- the statute, as written, uses the words \"defraud\" and the word -- the word \"property,\" and both of those terms are terms that this Court has defined very narrowly. In Nader, it defined a \"fraud\" as --\n Ms. Brill, I thought your brief said that we have an anti-smuggling statute, which is directed precisely against smugglers, but it only applies to those countries that have similar protection for us.\n Yes, Justice --\n And Canada does not.\n Yes, Justice Scalia, that's exactly correct.\n The existence of that statute would seem to suggest -- and a statute which is limited to countries that will do the same for us -- would seem to suggest that we don't want to do this for Canada.\n Yes, that's exactly -- that's exactly right, Your Honor. There --\n But it's also limited to vessels. It's smuggling by water, not smuggling by --\n By automobile.\n -- vehicles, as was done here, so that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on land.\n Right. Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.\n Is there something better about reciprocity for vessels and not reciprocity for land smuggling?\n I think it just evinces what Congress was concerned about most at the time, Justice Scalia, but it was -- it is certainly the case that in any -- any time that this country has endeavored to deal with matters of international tax enforcement, it has always demanded reciprocity. It has done so through the smuggling statute, it has done so through the numerous tax treaties that the Second Circuit's RJR decision discusses at length. And one of the points the RJR decision makes is that, in 1951, at the very time that Congress was looking at the wire fraud statute and enacting it, the Senate was, at the same time, becoming concerned that this country had gone too far in extending reciprocity in connection with its tax treaties and was actually evincing a policy of cutting back on the degree to which we would assist other countries in tax enforcement. And so the issue is to look at -- that the revenue rule must be used as a background principle of common law against which -- against which the revenue -- excuse me, against which the wire fraud statute is --\n Well, if we don't view this case as involving some attempt to indirectly enforce Canada's tax laws -- suppose we don't view it with that lens -- then does that put it outside the so-called revenue --\n Well, if it were not -- if it did not serve the function -- it doesn't matter what the government's intent is and what is in the mind of the prosecutor, but if it did not have any effect of enforcing a foreign government's revenue rule, then, yes, it would be outside; but there are numerous ways in which this prosecution does enforce a foreign government's revenue rule. Certainly, it deters future violations. The sentence was based on the -- an estimate of the intended loss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in Canada to determine what the amount was that was owed. And so the District Court became, essentially, part of the tax enforcement apparatus of the Government of Canada by performing that assessment in the first instance. And so anytime that we impose criminal or civil liability in a manner that affects the tax policies of another country, we are enforcing that rule. If we -- whether we're requiring compliance with the -- with the tax rule of a foreign country or punishing noncompliance. All of those --\n Is the rationale for the rule that enforcement of taxes is so unpopular that we want to minimize the exposure to -- of our judges so that they -- the only thing they have to do is enforce taxes that -- that are paid to our own Government? I'm serious about that. Is that the rationale?\n Well, I think there's a certain amount of self-protection in some of the decision -- decisions, surely; but the real -- the underlying purpose of the revenue rule is a recognition that foreign -- that taxes, in general, are a matter of policy. They're inherently policy-based; they're not based on contract or other kinds of commerce. They do not -- they do not assist in resolving disputes between private parties. And often they're imposed -- especially customs duties, are imposed to disadvantage other countries, and so the courts have said these are a peculiar type of law, they serve only the interest of the -- of the foreign sovereign, and there's a particular -- there's been a particular sensitivity about scrutinizing those foreign laws, potentially declaring them invalid under the foreign governments' own laws or pursuant to our own Constitution. And so revenue rules have historically been a categorical exclusion to general principles of comity through which we might otherwise recognize foreign laws or foreign judgments. And the rule has come to be so entrenched, and has been so well established, that there's a whole body of background law in the tax treatise of our country, and of many other countries, that is based on our non-recognition and our non-enforcement of foreign revenue laws. So --\n But if we did -- if we did enforce even a tax judgment of another country, there would be no U.S. law that would be violated. You're talking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes of another. But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign Relations now, that's put in terms of -- there's no requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or judgments of another; but neither is there any prohibition.\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, the current restatement is worded in -- addresses judgment specifically. It does not -- it doesn't address un-adjudicated tax codes. But there's always been a much greater suspicion, a much greater reluctance, to get into enforcing a claim brought by a foreign country, where that country's own processes have not been allowed to run their course and to have the initial determination. There -- the restate -- the second Restatement of Foreign Relations law, which is -- was -- came out in 1965 and is closer to reflecting what the law was at the time Congress enacted the wire fraud statute, says, in Section 41, Comment L, \"Under the -- under the foreign relations law of the United States, courts in the United States will generally refrain from taking action to give effect to the penal or revenue laws of other states, except as provided by international agreement.\" And so that -- that was a statement by the -- by the propounders of the -- of the Restatement of what they -- what they believed the law was at the time. To the extent it's qualified, I think it's just to leave room for the fact that the Senate can promulgate treaties, or Congress can, by statute, command that courts recognize these laws. But it's --\n You don't -- you don't assert that this -- that it -- that this couldn't be done. You just --\n Not that --\n -- assert that we shouldn't interpret this statute to have done it.\n Exactly, Justice Scalia. If Congress had written a different wire fraud statute that had said, \"You can't have a scheme to defraud the revenue, whether foreign or domestic,\" that would have been a clear statement abrogating the revenue rule. But we don't have any such clear statement, and the terms -- the terms \"defraud\" and the terms \"property\" have to be read with the background rule in mind.\n May I --\n But you would come to that conclusion even if we had a reciprocal enforcement agreement. If this were Country X, where we did have a reciprocal enforcement agreement, you'd come to the same conclusion, no prosecution under this statute.\n Correct, Your Honor, because there wouldn't -- this statute wouldn't have been written to take that into account. This --\n So, in a sense, the revenue position is irrelevant to your -- to your secondary or your -- or your independent argument on statutory construction. The revenue rule is irrelevant to it.\n As to just whether an unassessed tax claim --\n Yes.\n -- is property, the revenue rule -- the revenue rule adds a boost to it, but there are two -- there are two dimensions to the property element. One is that, as I said -- and if a -- if a tax claim is not -- has not been subject to an assessment, that whatever interest the Government may have in that is not in the nature of property; it is simply in the nature of law-enforcement power to collect. They -- some of these revenue rule cases talk about the power to --\n So tax revenues are not property, in your view?\n Once a tax is collected, once the Government actually has money in its hands, and if there's a scheme to, let's say, obtain an illegal refund through a tax and -- that would be a scheme to deprive a government body of money. But a scheme to merely evade paying a tax is not something that falls within the statute, separate and apart from the revenue rule. But the revenue rule -- as a result of the revenue rule, it is also the case that no state court would have recognized any property interest in a foreign sovereign, even if it had reached the point of a judgment. And so it works in both ways. The --\n May I ask you, Ms. Brill, something that puzzled me about this case? It is a rather peculiar use of our wire fraud statute. Are there any proceedings going on in Canada? Has there been any attempt to extradite these people?\n Justice Ginsburg, there was an indictment that Canada issued against the Petitioners. It has charges under -- for smuggling, under Canadian law, which is Customs Act, Section 159. It charges unlawful possession of imported spirits under Excise Act 163(1)(b), disposing of goods illegally imported, in violation of Customs Act, Section 155. So Canada has its own process. There has -- there has not been, to my knowledge, any request by Canada for extradition, but the treaty between the United States and Canada does include revenue violations, and --\n Presumably, if we punish this person this way, Canada wouldn't -- there's no double jeopardy, right?\n That's correct.\n So we'd be punishing this person for violating Canadian law, and then Canada would punish this person for violating Canadian law.\n Yes, I haven't looked in detail at the statute of limitations provisions, but that could be the effect. And we could be punishing them much more severely than Canada would be. They have their own means of balancing what they think the appropriate balance is for these things, and certainly the wire fraud statute, 57 months in our --\n Well, I think the Government has an interest in saying, \"Look, if you're going to smuggle, have your scheme up there in Canada; don't use our wire systems for fraudulent purposes. We don't like that here.\"\n And if they want to pass a law that says that, because of the -- because there's a domestic --\n Well, they -- of course, they say that this covers it, and it seems to me that really the -- that turns on the definition of \"property\" --\n Okay.\n -- which is an arguable point.\n What if the -- instead of a wire fraud case, it was assault and battery? Supposing the Canadian revenue agent got inside of New York and one of your clients beat him up, would we have -- solely because he was mad at him for trying to interfere with his attempt to smuggle into Canada -- would we have to say that you can't do that, we have no jurisdiction over the assault and battery?\n No, Justice Stevens. It's -- the question is whether you're --\n The only purpose would be just what the purpose is here, they're trying to facilitate the smuggling operation.\n Well, the assault and battery -- whatever the assault and battery provisions are, you would be bringing the prosecution solely for that purpose; it does not have any -- the effect of applying the assault and battery statute, if there was one --\n Is to interfere with Canadian's collection of their taxes. That's the only reason for it.\n Well, I think it -- in that case, it would be -- it would be far too attenuated to reach that conclusion. There could be -- the motive of a person --\n Why is that any more attenuated than a conspiracy carried out down here in Maryland using American assets to do the evil deed in Canada?\n Well, the motive of the person performing the assault and battery would be irrelevant to the prosecution. It's whether they intended to do the improper touching and, in fact, carried it out.\n Well, why isn't the motive irrelevant here? We don't want our facilities to be used for criminal activity.\n The question is whether --\n Any more than in the -- in the hypothetical we don't want citizens beaten up on our soil.\n Justice Kennedy, the issue is whether -- is what Congress had in mind in enacting the wire fraud statute. And, in general, we presume that Congress had domestic concerns in mind, not that we have incorporated vast bodies of --\n Well, but it used broad language, \"Any scheme to defraud by means of wire communications in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n The wire -- it is -- the wire communications may be an interstate or foreign commerce, the word \"any\" modifies \"any scheme or artifice to defraud\" --\n This statute applied against people who defraud the United States Government in taxes?\n Your Honor, the government's position on that, I believe, is somewhat inconsistent. The tax -- the tax division and the Department of Justice U.S. Attorneys manual specifies that it is -- they believe it is the intent of Congress that tax matters will be dealt with through the internal revenue code, not through other means. There are -- there have been some prosecutions brought in the case of an illegal -- an illegal tax shelter, where there is truly an -- a private party who is defrauded into giving up money in connection with --\n But you don't -- you don't know of any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving the Federal Government of property.\n Well, the Henderson case, which we have cited in our reply brief, is one from the Southern District of New York, where Judge Weinfeld said, when faced with a mail fraud prosecution of that type, this is outside the scope of anything that Congress intended. The -- I would like to get back to the issue of money or property so that it -- to have it conceptually why an unassessed tax claim is not money or property. There is no allegation that -- in the indictment or anywhere -- that the petitioners took any money out of Canada's treasury. So money is not an issue. At most, it was an effort to evade Canada's right to collect money, not any money it had --\n You could say the same thing if it were a building fraud. Suppose there were contractors building a Canadian building for the Canadian Government and they had a big fraud scheme down here, and it was to deprive the Canadian Government of money? I think the statute would clearly apply.\n The statute only applies -- what McNally said is, any assistance a governmental body obtains from the statute must be in the capacity of property-holder. And so the -- a scheme to defraud somebody out of their -- out of a building, that's traditional property. There's not -- it is not the same thing. Let's have an -- let's take an example of an interference with prospective economic advantage. So there is a defendant who says to somebody else who's about to get a contract -- I know my competitor is about to get a contract, and I say, \"Why don't you go out of town? There's a -- there's a much bigger contract that you can get if you fly to Michigan.\" And, meanwhile, I go in, and I usurp the contract and take it for my own purposes. Well, I've interfered with that person's prospective economic advantage, and so there would be a tort, and the person could collect from me. But I have not taken any money or property from that person that was in his possession. And what McNally and Cleveland point us to is whether there was money or property in the hands of the -- of the victim. And Canada's interest -- until there has been an assessment, Canada's interest is purely that of a -- of a sovereign. It is -- it does not have a claim to any money that is in the bank account of somebody who owes it a debt. And the Johnston case, which we've cited in our reply brief, Your Honor, talks about -- this Court talked about a statute in which there was a boxing promoter who collected fees for the boxing match and also collected taxes at the same time. And the U.S. Government could not bring an embezzlement action against that person for not paying the taxes, because those taxes were not -- were not yet anything that qualified as governmental property.\n Ms. Brill, in the Court of Appeals, they treated the argument that this was not property as entirely separate from the revenue rule question. And I thought your petition for cert was confined to the first question.\n Well, Your Honor -- no, Your Honor, we talked about both in the petition for cert. And in the question --\n But the question, itself, doesn't refer to the property issue.\n It talks about the --\n Was it -- was it phrased the same way it is in your brief, in the petition?\n Yes. Yes, the --\n Well, then the last part of it --\n Right, but --\n -- obviously covers it.\n Yes, the last part talks about --\n Oh, I see. I'm sorry, you're right. Yeah.\n Yes, okay. But to return -- to return to the revenue rule -- and thank you, Justice Stevens, for bringing me back to that -- the Government has acknowledged that there can be no restitution here. And that's in -- that's in the joint appendix, at page 106. They expressly waived it. They said that even if there was a foreign judgment that Canada was trying to bring here, that would be unenforceable. There could be no RICO actions, because that's unenforceable; and no proxy suits on behalf of a foreign government. And so the only thing that they say is, beyond -- is not included -- the only act of enforcement which they say is not included is, somehow, criminal enforcement. And under Section 14 of the -- excuse me, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Congress has power to enforce that amendment, and it has done so both in enacting statutes for civil recovery, as well as criminal recovery -- criminal punishment, excuse me. And so it's -- the notion that somehow incarcerating someone is not -- is not punishment is not something that makes much sense in that context. The decisions of this Court have held that penalties are -- monetary penalties count as punishment, and also that injunctions are -- fall within the scope of the revenue rule. That's in the Wisconsin versus Pelican Insurance case, which actually addresses the penal -- the penal rule, which is the close corollary.\n May I ask you, when -- now that we're getting into money, one of the things that the sentencing court had to do was to find out how much of a loss there was, and that involved determining what taxes would be due under Canadian law. And did that increase the sentence? Did the -- did the sentence vary with the amount of taxes that they -- we found due?\n Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it very much did. The loss calculation was based on intended loss, and so they -- what the District Court judge did was estimated the number of cases of liquor that were intended to be brought into Canada, and applied that number to the amount of the tax that Canada, he believed, would have applied to that -- to that amount. And that ended up changing the sentence from six months to, in the case of the Pasquantino brothers, 57 months, and the -- and, in the case of Mr. Hilts, 21 months. So the bulk of the sentence was based on the Canadian tax law and our courts making that assessment.\n A judge making that assessment.\n The judge made the sentence -- made the assessment at sentencing, yes. What the -- what the -- what the Government did in this case was to submit, very self-consciously, all of the issues of Canadian tax law to the jury. And the Assistant U.S. Attorney said this to the Fourth Circuit en banc panel several times, that they were presenting these matters of Canadian tax law as factual issues for the jury to find. But, ultimately, in sentencing, it was -- it was the court that ended up imposing and elevating that sentence. If there aren't further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n Mr. Dreeben.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: A prosecution for wire fraud based on defrauding a foreign government of taxes serves at least four distinct United States prosecutorial interests. The first is that the creation of schemes to defraud frequently spawns collateral criminal conduct in the United States above and beyond the fraudulent scheme itself. Here, for example, one of the defendants was charged in the indictment with using a gun in relation to the charged wire fraud scheme. Second --\n Where? Using a gun where?\n In the United States, Justice Ginsburg.\n Well, why didn't you prosecute him for that?\n That crime depended upon the validity of the wire fraud charges, because the crime was use of a gun during in relation to this wire fraud scheme.\n But that really doesn't get you anywhere, does it? I mean, if the United States says, \"We don't want this gun offense to be prosecuted unless there's a wire fraud prosecution,\" that doesn't tell you anything as to whether there ought to be a wire fraud prosecution.\n Well, what it tells you, Justice Souter, is why the United States has an interest in enforcing a law that facially is written to cover schemes to defraud that are carried out using the United States wires.\n But that's -- but that's a reason for extending the statute to everything, to everything --\n No, Justice Scalia --\n -- reading \"property\" to mean anything at all. I mean, what you're saying is, the broader you read this statute, the more bad guys we're going to catch. I'll stipulate that. Of course it's true.\n Well, Justice Scalia, I'm starting from the proposition that the language of the wire fraud statute textually applies to this scheme, and Petitioner's argument is that, because of the common law revenue rule, the statute should be read to exclude schemes to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue. And the fact that a foreign government is defrauded of tax revenue does not mean that the United States does not have an independent interest in rooting out that scheme and prosecuting it. In addition to the collateral criminal conduct that such schemes can spawn, the creation of such schemes indicates a criminal mind and a criminal group that can turn its techniques for used -- using to smuggle into Canada, also to smuggle back into the United States or to victimize other victims in the United States.\n What about evading a Cuban tax law that we think -- that many people would think is an unjust tax law? I mean, one of the things I'm worried about is that this gets us into foreign policy. Are you sure that we always want to enforce the tax laws of foreign countries through this fraud statute, no matter what those tax laws happen to be?\n The United States has prosecutorial discretion to determine when to invoke the statute and in what interests it should be served.\n It may well, but when it comes here, this Court is going to have to decide -- we'll just approve whatever you want to prosecute and let you not prosecute whatever you want?\n There is no provision in the statute, Justice Scalia, for this Court to second-guess foreign-policy determinations that are made --\n Well, not just foreign policy. The White Russians come here because they don't want to pay Lenin's taxes designed to equalize all individuals, in terms of property. Country A has a tax law that makes everybody a criminal because nobody really ever pays all the taxes. Country C has a set of laws that tax bibles. Country D has a -- I mean, you know, we can spin out the examples endlessly, and they're not farfetched. So take all the arguments from last week, called \"any court arguments,\" cross- -- or two days ago -- just let's cross-reference them. The problem is complexity of tax law. The problem is many, many, many would be contrary to American policy. And the problem is, nobody really knows what they are; indeed, they don't even know what American tax law is, no single individual, I suspect. Let's put in Italy, France, Byelorussia, Belarus, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and 35,000 others. Everybody becomes a criminal. And then we say, \"Don't worry, we'll only prosecute the real bad ones.\" That's the argument, I think, on the other side, and I'd like to hear your response.\n Justice Breyer, I don't think there's any reason to assume that everyone becomes a criminal. What this --\n No, only people who come over here because they don't want to pay taxes in those countries. Sometimes we would agree with them --\n Justice Breyer, in order to violate the wire fraud statute, you have to use deception in order to deprive another --\n Yes, they don't tell Lenin that they're coming --\n Well, that wouldn't involve the use of the United States wires --\n -- and they write to each other. They have a cousin, in Brooklyn, who forwards them the money to get out.\n Justice Breyer, if one stipulates that that violates the wire fraud statute or that there's enough conduct that does, the question still comes down to whether the United States chooses to prosecute that case. This is not a --\n The question comes down to whether this statute, which doesn't have to be read that way, ought to be read that way, whether it makes sense to read it that way. What about -- does Canada have an income tax?\n I'm not sure of Canadian tax law.\n Well, let's assume --\n In the context of this case --\n -- Canada has an income tax. Would you -- would you prosecute a Canadian who files a deceptive Canadian income tax return?\n Not for using Canadian facilities to do so.\n No, no, no, from this country. He's -- you know, he's a snow goose and is in Florida when he files his return.\n He files it electronically.\n Yeah.\n The wire fraud statute is applicable to schemes to defraud, generally speaking. The questions in this case are whether there is a common law rule that should be read to provide background.\n One reason for it -- I just -- you don't seem to know completely about Canadian law. How much do you know about the tax law of Vietnam? Because Los Angeles is filled with Vietnamese refugees, many communities of such people in the United States. Do we know how many of them perhaps might owe taxes under the law of Vietnam, and maybe are talking to each other about whether they really want to pay it?\n I don't think this is a realistic problem, Justice Breyer, that should require the Court not to read a statute whose language --\n Well, what about the wealth tax in France?\n There are a variety of taxing schemes all across the world. The question that the United States has to make when it determines whether to prosecute a wire fraud scheme is whether it's in interest -- in the interest --\n Mr. Dreeben, at the beginning of your argument, you said there were four federal interests you were going to identify. You've been able to identify one. You don't want them running around with guns. What are the other three?\n The other three are --\n The second one, which I began to allude to before hearing some questions about -- foreign government.\n Before you were asked a brief question.\n -- are that people who engage in schemes in this country are capable of then using the same techniques against victims in this country. The third reason is that the creation of international schemes to defraud, like the smuggling scheme in this case, poses independent threats to the United States Government because international criminal organizations are particularly difficult for the United States to deal with. And the fourth reason is that it is an offense to a foreign government, the United States Executive Branch may conclude, to allow our soil and our wires to be used to perpetrate a smuggling scheme against a foreign government with the United States doing nothing about it.\n Well, if we're concerned about offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to go, in fact, the way Congress has gone in this area, we negotiate treaties? I mean, one of the reasons why we go the treaty route are the kind of problems that Justice Breyer brought up, we want to have reciprocal treaties. We want two things. We want to make sure that it's a basically fair system that we're dealing with. On the other hand, we want to say, \"If we do anything with respect to your taxes, we want to make sure that we get the same benefit from you with respect to ours.\" So never mind the revenue rule, isn't it pervasive that -- when it comes to enforcing tax claims, that the route that Congress has chosen to go, and the Executive, as well, has been the treaty route?\n Justice Ginsburg, those are tax treaties designed to mutually assist the countries to collect taxes. This is a prosecution directed at fraud. The collection of taxes in a cooperative, reciprocal manner between governments implicates very different interests than the United States has when it seeks to combat people who have intended to devise, or have devised, a scheme to defraud in the --\n One of --\n -- United States.\n -- one of -- one of the last interests that you mentioned, about offending foreign governments, well, on the face of this, it would seem, the one that -- the country that's been done out of taxes is Canada, not the United States. So, we should help Canada, if it's interested in collecting revenue from these people or trying them for a criminal offense, to do that. It -- I asked Ms. Brill, Have they been indicted in Canada? She said yes, but she said it's -- they had not -- there has not been a request for extradition. Is that -- is that --\n That's my understanding, as well, Justice Ginsburg. And the pursuit of this prosecution by the United States reflects that when United States citizens engage in fraudulent conduct on our soil, our Government has a distinct interest, from Canada's interest, in pursuing the prosecution of this case.\n How long has this statute been on the books, this wire fraud statute? Pretty old statute.\n 1952. And its antecedents are the mail fraud statute, which was enacted in 1872.\n How many prosecutions like this have there been? When was the first one?\n This --\n For, you know, using the mails or interstate commerce to defraud a foreign government of taxes?\n This type of prosecution became more common in the 1980s when Canada greatly increased its taxes on importation of tobacco and alcohol.\n More common, or didn't exist at all before the 19- -- do you know of any case before --\n No, I'm not aware of any case before --\n -- before the 1980s?\n That's right.\n Doesn't that suggest to you that the statute isn't naturally read to cover stuff like that?\n No, I think the statute --\n We didn't have smugglers before then?\n No, of course there were smugglers before then, but the statute, on its face, is broad. And the only justification -- the only two justifications for seeking to read it narrowly are, first, that there's a common law revenue rule that forms a backdrop for the construction of the statute. That is wrong, the Government submits, because there is no common law revenue rule that has ever been articulated that says one country cannot prosecute people in that country for defrauding a foreign government of tax --\n What's the second reason?\n The second reason is the claim that to deprive a foreign government of money by not paying tax revenues is not common law fraud.\n Okay. Well, and you have arguments against both of those two. Which arguments are at least -- at least -- arguable? What about a third rule, the rule of lenity?\n Well, Justice Scalia --\n If we -- if we are unsure, if it's a close question whether it's property, if it's a close question whether we're enforcing the tax laws of Canada by prosecuting somebody for violating the tax laws of Canada, if that's a closed question, why doesn't the rule of lenity apply?\n Well, if the Court concluded that the question was not susceptible of resolution by resort to the usual tools of statutory construction, then you would apply the rule of lenity. But it's our submission that neither of these two theories --\n But may I ask this question? I think you have conceded, in a footnote -- and maybe you're -- almost conceded -- that if this were a RICO case, a civil RICO case, that the Congress enacted the RICO statute against this background rule and that perhaps the RICO case could not go forward. What if it were a federal RICO case and -- the same facts -- would the RICO statute be qualified by the revenue rule?\n No, it would not, Justice Stevens, and that's because of the precise distinction that I drew in response to Justice Scalia's question. This is a suit by the United States Government, as Plaintiff, not by a foreign government, as Plaintiff or prosecutor. The revenue rule essentially concerned with interests of sovereignty. One foreign government should not be able to come into our courts and enforce its sovereign power by using our courts to collect taxes from our citizens.\n What about the other reasons underlying it, which is what I was trying to get at before? I see, literally, that the common law -- you know, the enforcement rule, this is not literally enforcement. But what I was driving at with my questions is, even though literally it's not, the problems of complexity, the problems of knowability, and the problems of there being so many, many foreign tax laws that we might think are basically unfair, that those considerations apply here, just as they do with the enforcement rule, and then add the fact that turning people into criminals under threat of prosecution by the Federal Government is really very much equivalent to enforcing the foreign rule in a court. I mean, that's the whole thing spelled out. And I meant it seriously, though I used foreign examples to, sort of, drive the point home. What is your response to that?\n Well, Justice Breyer, first of all, the complexity of foreign tax law is something that would defeat a federal prosecution in which we need to show specific intent to defraud if the law were not sufficiently clear for us to be able to meet that burden. This case illustrates the kind of prosecution that will be brought. There are taxes that are due upon the importation of alcohol. The Petitioners arranged, through the wires, to bring alcohol from Maryland up to New York, and then they got it across the border by not answering questions when asked by customs officials and by not going to secondary inspection when they were asked. In order to bring a criminal prosecution that requires specific intent to defraud, the government is not going to be relying on obscure systems. As to the concern about the enforcement of tax systems that the United States may believe are -- is unfair, that is the prerogative of the Executive Branch to determine in deciding whether a prosecution should be brought in a particular case. This Court has repeatedly recognized that the Executive Branch is the preeminent branch in the area of foreign affairs --\n To go to one more aspect of the statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress said that -- with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud and, I think, other things -- that restitution to the victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the government to decide restitution or not. Except here restitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's taxes, so you have conceded no restitution. But it seems to me that Congress thought of the wire/mail fraud statutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and that suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to be the object of the scheme to defraud.\n Justice Ginsburg, the syllogism doesn't track, because the entire scope of the revenue rule, as defined in the common law cases that can be pointed to as the background principle, has to do with a foreign government, or someone acting on its behalf, coming into this country's courts to enforce its tax rules. Here what you have is the United States Government determining that it is in the interest of the United States to bring a criminal prosecution. Now, in this case, the prosecutor did concede below that restitution was not appropriately ordered. That's not the position of the United States. The position of the United States is that restitution under the mandatory statute should be ordered and it does not infringe the revenue rule. But there are --\n Now, how could that be, because restitution is to the victim? The victim is Canada. You collect Congress -- or Canada's tax, and you give it to Canada. Is there any other kind of restitution?\n No, there isn't, Justice Ginsburg, but the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it applies to efforts by the United States Government to secure punishment by -- for a criminal conviction. But, Justice Ginsburg, if the Court were to disagree with that and were to believe that restitution, even when it's been sought by the United States -- not by a foreign government, in its own right, with the power to instigate a lawsuit -- but that even when the United States does it, that somehow falls within the parameters of the common law revenue rule, then the answer to that problem would be to interpret the restitution statute against the background of the revenue rule, not to interpret the wire fraud statute against the background of the revenue rule and hold that a prosecution by the United States is wholly barred. The Petitioner's submission here is really rather extraordinary --\n The restitution statute is not ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of ambiguities in it. And if I had to find my way out of the restitution problem, I would pick the ambiguous statute to get out, rather than simply saying, \"Well, though this restitution statute says this categorically, we will ignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be enforcing the revenue laws of another country.\" There's nothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another country, if we want to; this is just a question of statutory interpretation. Should this ambiguous statute be interpreted that way? If Congress said, \"We're going to enforce Canada's tax laws,\" there's nothing wrong with that. But --\n Justice Scalia --\n So you have two statutes. One of them seems to be quite ambiguous. The other one is categorical, you get restitution in all cases. Now, how do I wiggle out of it?\n There's a difference --\n Obviously, I wiggle out of it with the ambiguous statute.\n -- there's a difference, Justice Scalia, between an ambiguous statute and a broad statute. The wire fraud statute is unequivocally broad, and it has been so interpreted. It's not ambiguous on the question of whether it applies to schemes to defraud that may involve foreign victims; it says \"any scheme to defraud.\" And I think, as Justice Kennedy's questions pointed out earlier, if there were a scheme to defraud a foreign business interest in Canada or a foreign governmental interest in Canada relating to some commercial venture, the wire fraud statute would apply, and --\n What about -- what about a scheme --\n But you haven't told me -- you haven't told me how you get out of the restitution statute. There's no ambiguity there, and it is not a rule of law that you can't -- it's unconstitutional to enforce the tax laws of Canada. Since it's entirely feasible, and since the text is categorical, how do you get out of the restitution statute?\n Here is how I get out of it, Justice Scalia. If you think, as I do not, that the revenue rule would bar restitution at the behest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, there is a background principle that says when there is an established rule of the common law, Congress legislates against that background, and unless it makes its intent clear and unequivocal to overcome that background rule of the common law, then the statute will not be interpreted to be in derogation of it. It was that principle that formed the basis for the government's view that Canada cannot come in under the RICO statute --\n Well, that view is in -- somewhat in tension with your view that the common law revenue rule doesn't stand in the way of this prosecution. If you have to interpret the statute in light of the general rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes, absent a treaty.\n Well, Justice Ginsburg, there is no common law rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes. What there are, are a set of cases that deal with specific problems in which foreign taxes were at issue. And in all of the 20th century versions of this problem, what you had is a foreign government or an entity, acting at the behest of a foreign government, coming into another country seeking to use that country's courts to enforce its own tax rules. And in that context, the justifications for saying that one country will not enforce another country's revenue laws have to do with the sovereignty interests of the host country. One country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to carry out its own governmental policies, is doing something fundamental to its sovereign existence, and there's no obligation of the United States to assist the foreign government in using its court system to achieve those independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it, either. As Justice Scalia pointed out, it's not unconstitutional, if Congress wanted to allow it. But countries, historically, have not. And that principle does form an important backdrop --\n Have countries also -- just -- here, I don't know, in respect to the principle -- would it have been viewed as contrary to the principle if a country were to pass a law -- say, England were to pass a law saying it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes? I'm not saying they couldn't do it; I'm just saying, would a law like that, saying it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes -- would it have been viewed as contrary to an abrogation of -- or a -- you know, whatever you call it -- a derogation from the common law revenue rule?\n I think that that's essentially the same question in this case, with the one significant difference that here there is a domestic --\n But do you see why I want to characterize it? I mean, would you characterize -- my criminal statute's absolutely clear -- the clear is, it is a crime in England not to pay French taxes. Now, would you, or would scholars, or whoever, knew about the common law revenue rule, would they have said, \"There is a derogation from the common law revenue rule,\" or would they have said, \"It has nothing to do with it\"?\n Well, I don't know what scholars would have said about it --\n No, what would you have said?\n This is what I would say about it.\n Yeah.\n When you're dealing with the principle that a statute of the United States will not be construed to be in derogation of a common law unless it's clear that that's its purpose, the Court should be very careful in defining what the parameters of the common law are. The Court should not take a common law rule and treat it as some dynamic entity that has capability of growing a dimension that is not consistent with its purposes and that it had never assumed in any decided case as a means of telling Congress, \"You can't do what you have done.\" So I would say, Justice Breyer --\n We haven't told -- no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not telling Congress, \"You can't do what you have done.\" We're saying, \"Congress hasn't done this.\"\n Well, the only reason you would say that Congress hasn't done it, Justice Scalia, is if you concluded that -- and I would ask Petitioners what their best citations are, because I have not been able to find them -- what cases indicate that a country cannot bring the kind of prosecution that the United States did here to vindicate its own independent sovereign --\n Nobody says they can't do it. That's why I asked you my question. My question is simply whether you would consider an absolutely clear law -- we will -- we -- it is a crime not to pay your French taxes. I'm asking whether you would consider that -- I'm not saying they can't do it; I just want to know -- would it be in derogation of the common law principle?\n It would probably be in derogation of a more --\n That's what --\n -- fundamental principle.\n Not the revenue rule --\n Not the --\n -- but a more fundamental principle that one country usually does not legislate with respect to extraterritorial acts.\n That would be another one, too.\n But if you --\n Suppose they -- I -- that's why I want to know --\n But that's not applicable here, either, Justice Breyer, because the crime involves wire fraud in the United States.\n Yeah, but why isn't it applicable to the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation to order restitution? And it seems to me that the restitution that would be ordered would be just as much in derogation of the common law principle as the out-and-out collection in Justice Breyer's example.\n Justice Souter, again, to say that it's in derogation of the common law principle assumes that the common law principle has applicability to one country seeking to vindicate interests of its --\n Well, but I -- a moment ago, you said, \"Okay, we'll assume that there would be some derogation,\" in Justice Breyer's example. I don't see why you don't come to the same conclusion with respect to the restitution aspect here.\n Because the derogation that I was talking about with respect to Justice Breyer is punishing conduct that occurs entirely extraterritorially. This is not conduct that occurs entirely --\n Yeah, but the revenue -- the revenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non-extraterritorial enforcement. It has -- it has other rationales: difficulty of understanding what the revenue rule is; the -- you know, the problems of policy; there are lots of revenue rules in foreign countries that we certainly wouldn't want to enforce, and so on. It's not just extraterritoriality. And those -- those policies would be just as much implicated by the -- by the restitution as by the out-and-out enforcement in Justice Breyer's example.\n Well, Justice Souter, I think that the policies underlying the revenue rule are narrower than the ones that you have articulated; but, even more to the point, they are not justifications that found their way into any holdings that would lead a reasonable legislator in 1952, when the wire fraud statute was enacted, to conclude that this is a rule that I'm going to have to specifically --\n Well, perhaps --\n Well -- I'm sorry.\n No, go on.\n No, you.\n I was going to say, perhaps there were no specific holdings, because it would have been regarded as, kind of, a bizarre derogation of the rule in the first place. Nobody had dreamed up this scheme earlier.\n I was about to say the same -- the same thing. You keep saying there are no cases that do this. Are there -- are there -- are there cases, before 1980, which do what you want to do -- that is, to use our fraud law, or something, to effectively enforce Canada's -- or some foreign country's tax law?\n No, but what I would say about --\n No.\n -- the revenue rule is that it is a shrinking principle of the common law, not one that has been growing. It originally started out as a principle that allowed countries to avoid invalidating contracts that they believed were in furtherance of commerce. It gradually came under attack, because what it said is that the United States will not notice that a foreign country's laws have been violated in the formation of a contract, and so the contract will be enforced. Commentators recognized that that was contrary to principles of comity and recognition that each country does have a reciprocal interest in acknowledging each other's laws. In the 20th century, those contract cases completely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left are sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert its sovereign power inside the United States or inside a foreign country -- the United States, itself, tried it once in Canada -- to collect taxes. And countries said, \"We're not going to do that. We're going to leave it to the treaty process.\" But the rationales that Justice Breyer and Justice Souter have articulated, about complexity of foreign law and odious foreign tax systems, have never been the driving force behind the revenue rule. It's been --\n I got your point. I think it is that -- in my answer to my clear example, you would say no, that's not in derogation for the reason that there's an independent local reason for doing it. It's not being done to -- whether it has that effect or not, it's not being done in order to collect the foreign tax.\n That's right.\n That's been your response throughout.\n That is correct.\n Okay, I --\n What you have instead is a law of the United States that's enacted to serve perfectly valid interests that the United States Government has in rooting out fraud in this country and in dealing with schemes to defraud that are created here. And for the Court to say that, \"We don't like these kinds of prosecutions, because we're concerned about really bad foreign tax systems, and we're concerned about complicated law, and we're concerned that some common law rule that had never actually assumed the scope that Petitioners ascribed to it, should be formed -- read as the background principle for the interpretation of this statute\" is not a principle that finds any support in the construction of federal --\n Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you -- this is such a curious case. You were very candid in telling us that when Canada put these astronomical taxes on tobacco and alcohol, that was almost an invitation to smugglers. Did we have any discussions with Canada -- I mean, they do have that border, which is rather easy to cross -- about what we were going to do when they put the taxes on liquor sky-high?\n I am not aware, Justice Ginsburg, of what specific law enforcement conversations occurred, but I can tell you that there is extensive law enforcement cooperation with Canada, as a close neighbor, and that the interests of the United States very much do favor our policing against smuggling here, and Canada policing against smuggling there. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Ms. Brill, you have four-and-a-half minutes left.\n Thank you. The common law cases universally say that it does not matter who is bringing the claim. It can be the foreign government or it can be another person.\n Can I just ask you to tell us what your strongest case is? Because they did raise that question.\n Sure. On the -- on the issue of the identity of the person bringing the claim, the contract cases, Holman and Boucher, stand for that proposition, and the Peter Buchanan case, which came down in 1950, just before the wire fraud statute was enacted -- this was in the Appellate Court in Ireland -- it says, \"It is not a question whether the plaintiff is a foreign state or the representative of a foreign state or its revenue authority. In every case, the substance of a claim must be scrutinized. And if it then appears that it is really a suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of a foreign revenue, it must be rejected.\" That's at 1955 A.C. 529. And so with the -- with the Mandatory Restitution Act, this clearly is something to collect the debts of a foreign nation. And the sentencing scheme that Justice Ginsburg alluded to earlier, in which the sentences were enhanced based on the intended loss, demonstrate that this is an enforcement action. Stringam versus Dubois, which is an Alberta case from 1992, involving -- the plaintiff there was an executor of a probate estate, and the court said, \"The identity of the plaintiff in the action is not vital if the action indirectly has the effect of enforcing revenue laws of a foreign country.\" That's at 135 A.C. at page 70. And the way the revenue rule has been cited repeatedly is that it -- what it prevents is not just direct enforcement, but direct or indirect enforcement. And so it is -- the fact that there have not been criminal prosecutions, it clearly would have been in derogation of the common law for a -- for England to pass a statute saying it is criminal in England to break the laws of France.\n See, he's saying it isn't, for the reason that, he says, that if England did it for independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted to help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have been in derogation. Of course, it would have been legal, either way, but he says it wouldn't have been in derogation, for that reason.\n Right. Well, it clearly would have. There was no common law practice -- we have -- we have not found, in all the research -- and the Government has not found -- any example of a criminal prosecution -- not just in this country; anywhere in the world -- to -- deriving from the violation of a foreign government's tax. And so --\n You're saying, in effect, that derogation is an effects test, not an intent test.\n Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Justice Souter. And the -- in terms of what the government's interests are, there were no deceptive acts in this country. The way the Government gets a material misstatement is by a failure to disclose at the Canadian border, which only -- even though they did not put in evidence of what the -- that Canada even had a law requiring disclosure, the only way there could have been any kind of material misstatement would be if Canadian law required it, not if -- not anything that happened in the United States. In Cleveland, the Court was very clear to point out -- one of the reasons to adopt a rule of lenity in interpreting the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud statute is because violations serve as a predicate for RICO actions and for money-laundering violations. And so what the government's position is, is that we should carve out this ad-hoc exception and allow wire fraud prosecution, even though we would not allow any kind of a civil RICO action and even though we're going to have an ad-hoc exception for the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. But what the Court said in Cleveland is, the way we should do this is by adopting a proper interpretation in the first place, not by -- of the wire fraud statute -- not by having ad-hoc exceptions. And the reference to prosecutorial discretion that there should be faith that the Government will only prosecute, I guess, what the Government regards as exceptional cases is not something that can provide any business involved in an international transaction with any -- with any comfort. And thank you very much.\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents the issue of whether, when deciding the meaning of a statute, we will focus, as the Government suggests, on two words only, any court, or whether we will look at the statute as a whole, whether we will consider the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme and decide the meaning of the statute by appreciating how sections relate to one another. In this particular case, 922(g)(1) of 18 U.S. Code is a -- represents a merger of two old sections, title IV and title VII, that were passed in 1968 in the Omnibus Crime Control Act. In -- in those -- in that statute, we had two redundant and overlapping sections, and one talked about prohibiting persons who have been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than a year. One, title VII, talked about prohibiting persons convicted in any court of the United States or a State of a felony. There were different penalties, slightly different classes of people. Title IV focused more on the receiver; title VII more on the possessor. But nothing -- nothing about the -- these two titles, about the legislative history suggests that Congress at any time meant something different from the term, any court, in title IV and any court of the United States in title VII. And when these two were merged in 1986 in the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, again, nothing suggests, nothing in the comments, nothing in the statute, that these two terms -- that the elimination of the language, any court of the United States, was --\n Well, I guess we have held, though, several times that Congress meant to define very broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm statutes. Did we not?\n That's -- that's correct, Justice O'Connor. However --\n So it makes it a tougher case when you use the word any because we've given the -- the word any generally a broad definition.\n Well, earlier this year in the Nixon case, this Court said that when we look at any -- and that was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity. Did it mean any entity, public or private, or any private entity? The Court said any can and does mean different things depending upon the setting, and the Court said when using it broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate results, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the Court did. Now, you're right, Justice O'Connor. This Court has said that the purpose of the felon in possession statute was to be broad and sweeping, but the Government reiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases, Scarborough, Bass, and Lewis, and all three of those cases in which the Court referred to Congress' comments and this Court's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute were 1202(a) cases. And so notwithstanding the fact that the Court said this is a broad statute, each one of those cases, Lewis, Bass, and Scarborough, were cases where by definition the prohibition was against persons convicted in any court of the United States or a State. So that language doesn't help the Government at all because those were 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the Court to any court of the United States. So to take the -- and I -- and -- the simplistic view that as the -- as the Fourth and Sixth Circuit did and as the Government does here, that any means any, without regard to the rest of the statute, is simply -- is -- is too narrow a focus. Let's look at the statute. It's true that the word -- the term, the two words, any court, is not defined. But if we look in the definitions section, the term, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined. And so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase, convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than a year. And that definition says the term, crime punishable by more than a year, excludes any State or Federal antitrust or business regulatory offense. Now, if we exclude from the definition of crime punishable by more than a year and the Government's -- if we exclude from that any State or Federal antitrust law and the Government's interpretation is adopted, then we're left with the anomalous result that if a person is convicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're allowed to possess a firearm. If they're convicted of one in France or England, they can't.\n Are there any such cases? I mean, I never heard actually --\n No.\n -- when people -- no. I mean, are there any cases in which France or England has convicted people of an antitrust violation punishable by imprisonment for more than a year? I -- I didn't know that their antitrust laws had a criminal aspect, though I haven't looked it up.\n Nor have I --\n Fine. Well, I -- I've never heard if anyone in any foreign country, other than ours, though I gather my law clerk found that in Japan, in fact, Japan does have a criminal antitrust law. They may be the only ones outside the United States, and I don't know that anyone has ever been convicted under it because they're not too -- or they didn't used to be too fierce on antitrust enforcement.\n Well, 921(20) or --\n I'm just wondering how anomalous or your anomaly is. (Laughter.)\n Well, the -- the limitation not only excludes antitrust offenses, it excludes any business regulatory offense.\n And are there such?\n Of course. I think --\n I mean, maybe.\n Yes.\n I don't -- I don't -- but I just -- are we sure that there -- that, you know, that this anomaly exists?\n I'm certain that there are business regulatory crimes throughout the world.\n Why did they say any State or Federal? I mean, in -- in a way this provision -- you -- you may say that the -- that the substantive effect of the provision supports your interpretation, but the text of the provision supports the Government's --\n Well --\n -- because if any only means State or Federal, there was no need to say State or Federal in this provision. You could have simply said any in this provision, just as you said it elsewhere. So one would think that they said State or Federal because they wanted to exclude foreign antitrust matters.\n Well, this same limitation, Justice Scalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any court said any State or Federal court and the exclusion said any State or Federal court. It's consistent --\n Well, I don't care how it got there. I'm just saying there -- there -- if -- if any means what you said it means, namely State or Federal, there would have been no need to limit this other provision to State or Federal because the whole statute would only cover State or Federal.\n Well, but at some point in the statute, Congress has to give an indication of their intent, and this is where it is. For example, there's another limitation immediately following it which says it shall also not include any State offense which is described as a misdemeanor in the State and carries no more than 2 years.\n No. Well, but -- but Justice Scalia's point -- and I -- I think he's correct -- is that this cuts at least as much in favor of the Government as you and probably more because you would make Federal and State unnecessary surplus.\n Well, there has to be some indication --\n You don't -- you don't set forth the main qualification to the main definition in a -- in a later subsection.\n Well, if we go further with 921(20), there's another limitation that again clearly deals with States, and that's the restoration of civil rights provision. The Government concedes in their brief -- and that was an effort to essentially statutorily reverse the Dickerson v. Banner Institute case -- that that applies to State situations. The idea that if a person receives a State pardon or his record is expunged, that wouldn't be a disqualifying factor. And they talk about the law of the foreign state being what determines whether it's a conviction or not. Now, clearly we're not looking at going to some pardon process in Germany or Uruguay to decide whether a person still has a conviction. Another part of the statute that's very clear, 924(e)(1). That's the armed career criminal section. That section says that if a person's who's convicted under 922(g)(1), our statute, and has three prior serious drug convictions in a court described in 922(g)(1), then they get 15 years. Now, that definition of serious drug conviction is a State or Federal conviction. Now, let's flip over to 21 U.S.C. 802(44), the drug statute where you have a similar recidivist type of statute where you go from a 5-year mandatory to a 10-year mandatory if you have a prior drug conviction. There in 802(44), a serious drug offense is defined as a State, Federal, or foreign drug offense. So we see that Congress can differentiate when it wants to. Now, they're --\n Would -- would you concede that -- that this is at least sloppy drafting? Because they said any in one place, they said State or Federal in other places. Shouldn't they be -- be consistent in their terminology?\n Well, perhaps they should be more consistent, Justice Ginsburg, but the overall -- I mean, if you go down the list of the prohibitions in 922(g)(1), you can see that the thrust of this is -- is to deal with domestic situations. There's one that says you can't own a firearm if you're a -- a fugitive from law -- a fugitive from justice. That's specifically defined as a fugitive from another State within the United States.\n Mr. Boas, I think you make a strong argument that Congress probably didn't think of this particular problem. Do you suppose if at the hearings before the committee, the process of the legislation, some witness came in and said, do you realize this language is so broad it will cover the person who is convicted of a felony in Japan, as well as person who's convicted of a felony in Illinois, do you think they would have modified the statute?\n I think they would have. I think that -- I don't concede that there was really a need to, but I think they would have because they would have said it's --\n Well, there would have been a need to under your view now.\n That's right. But they would have historically going back to '68 and before, we always intended this to just cover domestic situations.\n But I suppose somebody on the committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in Japan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any difference with regard to the purpose of the statute.\n If the individual is convicted in Japan, Justice Stevens, then he would not be under our immigration laws allowed to come to this country, and if he did come --\n Well, but this person --\n -- he'd be an illegal alien.\n But the defendant in this case was convicted in Japan and he somehow got to the United States.\n Well, because he's an American citizen.\n Well --\n So -- but Congress can't cure every problem that exists in the world, and this statute is fairly comprehensive.\n Are people really not allowed to come in if they've been convicted of any crime?\n Any crime that carries more than a year basically. It's pretty --\n Suppose it was a crime like not wearing a veil if you're a woman in a country that -- suppose it was a crime like criticizing the government if you were in Soviet Russia. Suppose it was a crime like -- you know, there are all kinds of crimes that we -- we would never consider crimes --\n Well, that's --\n -- and in other countries there are -- we don't let anyone in if they've done any of those things?\n No. Well, those people will probably be seeking political asylum. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn -- under the Government's interpretation, Nobel Prize winners would be precluded from -- Solzhenitsyn did 8 years in a Soviet prison because he said nasty things about Joseph Stalin. Two American women in Afghanistan, before the fall of the Taliban regime, were arrested and convicted because they possessed Bibles. Now, the Government says, well, these are anomalies. These don't occur often. But Congress had to be aware of the possibility of tinhorn dictatorships all over the world having court systems that were so devoid of due process that we have to take a look at whether we want to --\n Well, the -- the court of appeals here said what it would -- it read in a check. It said it wouldn't read it to really mean any conviction. It had to be in a system that was fundamentally fair. Wasn't that what the court of appeals said?\n That's what they said, but -- but when and how do we decide that? There's another offense under 922(g) -- or under 922 that makes it a crime to give a false answer on a -- a firearms questionnaire when you go to buy the gun -- buy the gun. Now, what does the individual do? Does he say to the firearms dealer, do you have a list of countries where our Government has decided it's a fair enough system that I can say no -- yes, I have a conviction in view of the list that it's an unfair system so I can say yes, I have no -- or no, I have no convictions? I mean, it -- one of the reasons where we employ, for example, the rule of lenity, is -- is a person put on notice of what it is that's criminal and what is not. When does it come up that the system isn't fair enough to count?\n Well, I think -- let -- let's put, you know, the worst for you. If it were put to Congress, which would you prefer, that -- that Solzhenitsyn not be able to have a gun or that the worst kind of violent criminal convicted and imprisoned and escaped from a foreign country who manages to get into this country can go in and buy a gun? Which -- which of these two would you prefer? And I think I'd say, well, you know, it's tough on Solzhenitsyn he can't own a gun, but he'll probably get over it. (Laughter.)\n Well, what I'd prefer and what the statute means aren't necessarily the same thing, Your Honor. I'd prefer violent criminals who are dangerous not to have guns. But again, that --\n Suppose you put the question to Congress, which would you prefer? Would you prefer the occasional person who's been convicted of a foreign court, comes over here, that this statute doesn't apply to him, or would you prefer that all the refugees from Eastern Europe and people who come from Arab countries and people who come from countries that have quite different systems in places all over the world discover that suddenly they're felons because of things they never would have dreamt of because they were perhaps convicted of selling gasoline on the open market or perhaps they were convicted of any of these religious crimes we've talked about, selling a Bible? Suppose you put that question to Congress.\n I think Congress would say the perils and problems that exist by a blanket inclusion without any method of determining which count and which don't count of foreign convictions are too great. Now --\n Well, if it's a -- if it's a matter of notice and -- then that's a separate issue. Plus the Government, it seems to me, should put on its form that this includes foreign conviction, and that solves that problem.\n Well, but what if it's a foreign conviction where there's no due process? Is there a checklist that in that foreign conviction, did you have a jury, did you have the right to confront your accuser, did you have the right to remain silent? I mean, we all seem to realize that the Government's position that any conviction anywhere is too stark a place. And again --\n May -- may we go back to the -- the choice that you were given by Justice Scalia first and then Justice Breyer? I thought that someone who comes in here illegally and possesses a gun commits an offense.\n That's right.\n So -- so there's not -- Congress would say to that hypothetical, we've got a third choice, much more sensible. Anybody who sneaks in here without permission and has a gun --\n That's correct.\n -- commits a crime.\n That's one of the subsections of 922(g)(5). Anybody who's an illegal alien here illegally can't have a gun. Anyone --\n That doesn't cover Americans, of course --\n No. It doesn't cover --\n -- who go -- go and commit crimes abroad, are convicted abroad, and -- and come back to home sweet home and then get a gun. I mean, that seems to me extraordinary.\n That -- I didn't hear your --\n That seems to me extraordinary. I don't think Congress would have wanted that.\n Well, I don't think Congress can be said to have intended or envisioned that they would cure every problem in the world. It's a very, very narrow category of American citizens convicted abroad who come back here.\n I think if there was a problem that -- that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less likely the problem of having an American citizen killed by a gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime abroad than it is the problem of somebody having been convicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil or not wearing a veil or something else. If -- if it's either of those two problems that they meant to leave overlooked, I would say it's the latter. They might well have said, well, the courts will take care of that.\n Well, Your Honor, it's unclear what -- what their thought process was in this matter. But I can say this, that the narrow category that escapes the coverage of this statute -- there's nothing to indicate anywhere in any of the debates, in the language of the statute that that's what Congress intended. And again, if you look at the overall view here, I mean, fugitive from justice. It's limited to someone from the State. Person -- let's look at 922(g)(9). Very clear, incapable of misunderstanding. The same prefatory language. A person convicted in any court -- exactly the same, and it ends with the same language -- cannot ship, possess, receive. And what does it say? Instead of saying convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year, it says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And that's defined as a State or Federal misdemeanor.\n Where -- where is that defined?\n That's defined in 921(a)(33), Your Honor. It's specifically limited. Now, here we are. A person who beats his wife in England can have a gun in this country, but a person who commits a business regulatory offense in Germany can't. It makes no sense. The -- it -- it's a very clear statement by Congress that a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence -- they're only intending it to be a State or Federal crime.\n Once again, that -- that cuts both ways. Why would they -- if the text reads the way you say it reads, why did they have to say is a misdemeanor under Federal or State law? Because it wouldn't have mattered. The only courts -- the only convictions that would be covered would be Federal or State convictions. They would not need that -- that qualification.\n At -- at some point a person has to be told what Congress was intending. This language goes back to '68 where the language in the exclusion limiting it to State -- excluding Federal and State convictions matched the language in the term, any court, in 1202(a), which was title VII. They were -- they were complementing each other. And -- and if you look at even as far back as the Batchelder decision in the '70's from this Court, the Court talked about these two being redundant, overlapping, the only difference being that one uses the term felony, one uses the term crime punishable by more than a year.\n Mr. Boas, when they combined these two --\n Yes.\n -- and ones -- the 1202 did say Federal or State -- they made other changes, harmonizations. In the explanation of their consolidation of the two sections, to what extent did they discuss changes and the reasons for them?\n The -- they made no discussion of the reason for taking out the language, of the United States or of any State, and what they -- the only language was that we're intending to merge these into one statute --\n But they did -- they did explain other things --\n Yes.\n -- other changes, but this one -- there's silence --\n Exactly.\n -- as far as I understand.\n And -- and by keeping in the exclusions, by -- by looking at 924(e)(1) where it -- what's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you have three prior drug -- serious drug offenses in a court referred to in 922(g)(1), you get 15 years. Those three prior three drug offenses in a court referred to in 922(g)(1) are State or Federal drug offenses by definition. It seems to me that it really couldn't be any more clear. And frankly, to the extent it's not totally clear and it could go either way, I think then the rule of lenity requires that it be decided with a more narrow construction, that is, that any court meant any court of the State or of the United States. I believe it was in the -- in the '90's when this Court's opinion, authored by Justice Thomas in I think it was called Alvarez-Sanchez, dealt with a statute, 3105 dealing with the admissibility of confessions in Federal cases and that they won't be inadmissible if they're taken by any law enforcement official more than 6 hours after the arrest. And the issue what does any mean in terms of any law enforcement official. And the Court said it means any State or Federal law enforcement official. Now, it didn't have to reach the issue of whether it included foreign law enforcement officials, but certain things are obvious without an -- an explanation. And you're right. There was some sloppy drafting here and it could have been more clear, but when we look at the statute as a whole and try to harmonize the various parts of that statute, it would be almost absurd to think, when we look -- and -- and maybe these anomalies won't occur all the time, as you point out, Justice Breyer, but it would almost be absurd to think that with all of these limitations, exclusions, when we run down the list under 922(g)(1), that Congress was talking about any court in the world. Now --\n Let me -- let me ask you the question the -- the Chief Justice would ask, were he here, because he always asked this kind of a question. What -- if you had to pick your best case of ours which interpreted the word any in the way that you would like us to interpret here, what's -- what's the best case you have?\n I'd say -- that's -- there's a question --\n It's a good question. He asks good questions.\n It's a good question. (Laughter.)\n I'd say the Nixon case decided this year which said that any can and does mean different things depending upon the setting and whether it works strange and indeterminate results would be one of my best cases. There's -- when I sit down, I'll probably think of a better one, but --\n Maybe you can think --\n How -- how about --\n Maybe you can think of a unanimous case.\n Well -- (Laughter.)\n And this is one I'm -- I'm surprised that you didn't cite, but it -- I don't think you did -- EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company, where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the United States, title VII coverage, and this Court held that anyplace outside the United States did not mean that a U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti-discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place abroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the inter-State sitting -- setting and not international.\n Well, I -- I'm not familiar with that case.\n That -- that was a decision by the Chief. So -- (Laughter.)\n That's a good one -- that's a good one too, Judge -- Justice. I -- I -- there's -- there's another case that I'd refer to which is the -- the Gonzales case, which is cited by the Government. Gonzales is interesting because it deals with 924(c)(1), which is the section that says you get 5 consecutive years if you're convicted of -- 5 years consecutive to any other sentence if you're convicted of possessing a firearm during the course of a serious drug offense. And in that case, the Court concluded that any other sentence meant any State or Federal sentence, not just a Federal sentence. Now, the Government might argue that that helps them because the -- the defendant in that case wanted it to be limited to any Federal sentence because he was serving a State sentence, and the question was would the 5 years for the 924 violation be consecutive or concurrent, as the trial court gave it. But it -- what the Court did was say any depends on the context of the rest of the statute. And here, we think it means State and Federal. They didn't talk about foreign convictions. You know, it's interesting. It's ironic that -- that while we're debating how American citizens should be impacted by foreign convictions, the administration is unwilling to sign the treaty that would make American citizens subject to the International Criminal Court because there's concern about what would happen to Americans abroad, even in that court, not in a court in -- in Uruguay or in North Korea, but in the International Criminal Court. In fact, in the preliminary findings of the FOPA statute, the -- the Congress said -- and this Court doesn't have to decide and I'm not asking the Court to decide the Second Amendment issue, but Congress found the Second Amendment was a fundamental constitutional right. And the name of the statute is the Firearms Owners' Protection Act. Congress had in mind protecting the owners of firearms when necessary, and --\n You call that FOPA? That's the name of the statute? (Laughter.)\n It's an unfortunate acronym, isn't it? (Laughter.)\n That's right. The spelling is a little bit different, Justice Scalia. But Congress -- the -- the name of the statute tells you something about Congress' intent. The otherwise licit and blameless activity of possessing a firearm isn't the equivalent of selling drugs. Now, maybe if you have a prior drug offense and you're a drug dealer, under 802 of 21, Congress said you get your sentence doubled whether it's a State, Federal, or foreign conviction, but under 924(e) for a conviction under a court defined in 922(g)(1), the prior only ups your sentence if it's a State or Federal conviction. We can't ignore the overall statutory scheme here, which time and time again refers to domestic matters. The Government in their brief says foreign convictions are used all the time, and they give three examples. They say we recognize them for the purpose of extraditing American citizens. They say we recognize them because if you're convicted of a -- a sex offense in certain foreign countries, you have to register here. And they say we recognize them -- I forget what their third reason is. But there's no example that they gave or that they can give where a foreign conviction is ever used anywhere else in this country as an element of the crime. I mean, it's used for recidivist purposes and State courts have debated back and forth whether we're going to double somebody's sentence because of a foreign conviction, but it's never used anywhere else as an element of the crime. This -- this would be a first, and it's pretty significant. To me it's ironic that the Sentencing Commission said you can't use a foreign conviction simply to up somebody a few months in the guidelines. But the Government here argues that we can use it to satisfy an element of the crime --\n Recidivism is an element of the crime. If -- if you have a crime of, you know, repeated felony, recidivism is an element.\n Well, that -- that's correct, Your Honor. Of course, the -- it's an exception under Apprendi that the -- the prior crime. But what -- what I'm saying is it's -- it's a slightly different situation in terms of it being -- I know we have Blakely and the whole sentencing factor issue. But it -- it's a slightly different use of a prior and making -- in other -- in all those cases, the -- it's a crime whether or not you have a felony. The felony might make it a more serious crime. In our case, this isn't a crime without this felony. That's the thing that makes it a crime. And what I'm saying is the only situation we have where something that's otherwise blameless conduct becomes a crime is the use of a felony. There's no other situation where a foreign felony is employed or has been employed in that situation. If there's no other questions, I'd like to, if it would please the Court, reserve the --\n I'm sorry. You've exhausted your time.\n I have. Well, thank you.\n Ms. Millett.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Justice Scalia, you asked about what case we would want to adopt and be our strongest case on the meaning of the word any in the statute, and my answer to that question, although I take the liberty of answering it, though you didn't ask me --\n You can ask it as well -- (Laughter.)\n -- is the Gonzales case where this Court said that the word any in the gun control law, in this context, in this framework means, read naturally -- I'm quoting here. Read naturally, the word any has an expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind. This is not, Justice Ginsburg, a statute where Congress wrote sloppily. In fact, in Barrett and Huddleston, this Court specifically said and noted that excruciating care with which Congress wrote title IV, section --\n There is -- there's an overarching concern and I'll -- I'd like to put it to you right from the beginning. When a legislature legislates, be it the State or Federal Government, it is generally thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick. When Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United States. Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of the time when it is, it says so. And we have a number of cases, not just the Arabian American Oil Company. I mean, that -- the language of title VII was between a State and anyplace outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. And in that very case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to you now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our country, and if it means to say something that will take in other places in the world, it says so clearly. And we don't make the assumption that Congress was intending to have any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells us that. That's my overall concern about the Government's position in this case.\n Justice Ginsburg, this is not an extraterritorial application of a statute. This regulates a threat to American public safety within the United States by someone within the United States based on their conduct, possession of a firearm by a dangerous person within the United States. That is not extraterritorial application of the law.\n Yes, but --\n That's no more --\n -- but let me just interrupt on your -- your best case suggestion. I don't think the test is when has the word any been used in different ways, but has the word any court ever been used by Congress to include foreign courts.\n The -- the phrase convicted in any court --\n No. I'm asking about just the words, any court. What's your best case for the proposition that that would normally be construed by Congress to include foreign courts?\n I don't -- I don't have a case that specifically talks about --\n You don't have a case.\n -- that yet, but if I can -- if I can explain why the phrase convicted in any court -- because any court -- the -- the problem is you're not -- there's not a case for that. The word, any court, that -- those two words appear in a lot of places in the United States Code.\n And do they ever refer to foreign courts? That's the question.\n The -- not -- not that I'm aware of, but -- but they don't -- it -- it doesn't address it one way or the other. Most of the times, the vast majority of the times that you see any court in the United States, it -- in the United States Code, it's followed by qualifying terms. What's very important here is that the phrase convicted in any court without qualification. There's lots of any courts in the United States --\n But the reason you often need qualification is there's -- there's sort of a basic question, does this include State courts as well as -- as well as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out one way or the other. But I don't -- I'm not aware of any precedent for trying to decide whether it also embraces foreign courts.\n Justice Stevens, if I could make two points. Again, convicted in any court is rarely employed by Congress. Rarely. And we've cited in our brief on the occasions it has been employed, the context and structure are wholly consistent with including foreign judgments. The PATRIOT Act created a ban on the possession of biological agents or toxins, and it -- it picked up this same phrase and put it in there, and I think it is -- would -- and that is also a statute that in a separate provision has extraterritorial application.\n How many times have you used this statute to go after people who were convicted in a foreign court?\n It -- it's -- I can't give you an exact number because we --\n About, approximate.\n -- we don't know about the ones that we never hear about.\n More like 100, more like 50, more like 10, more like 5? About how many?\n It's -- it's not that -- I would -- I would say there's probably 10 to a dozen, but I -- I have to --\n 10 to a dozen over how long a period of time? 20 years, 18 years?\n Since 1968. It's been on the books since 1968.\n '68. Now -- so 35-40 years. Now -- now, how many times do you think that people -- I mean, the -- the -- if you've used it only a dozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound like a major threat. What I'm weighing against that is the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of selling Bibles. That really does happen, and there really were economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European countries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been giving you. And so if you were in Congress -- or -- or why do you think that Congress would have wanted to get the courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair? And we start distinguishing one country from another. And what are the procedures in the Ukraine or Kazakhstan anyway? I mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of a dozen cases in 40 years.\n Justice Breyer -- and Justice Stevens, I do want to get back because I do have a lower court case that interprets any court in the way you discussed. I want to get back to that. But Justice Breyer, I understand this being a very important concern, and -- and there are no doubt particular applications that could seem unappealing, just as in Lewis v. United States where this Court held that an invalid, a patently unconstitutional State conviction counts for section 922(g)(1). The reason that the -- the convictions are covered here is Congress was not --\n Which was it? Just -- what was the case you just mentioned?\n Lewis v. United States, and that is -- that's really our favorite case, although we like the word of -- definition Gonzales has for any. But in Lewis v. United States, this Court addressed the question whether the ban on possession of firearms by someone convicted of, I'll say, a felony, a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year, applies to -- to convictions that are allegedly unconstitutional under State law or may, in fact, be unconstitutionally entered. They could have been the product of a coerced confession. The allegation there was lack of representation of counsel.\n Well, that -- that example, which you gave in your brief, gave me this concern. The problem that you've just been describing, the State convictions that may be invalid but is being used under 922, I regard that as a kind of a venue question because you can go back to the State that rendered the conviction and say, State, I was convicted in violation of the Constitution, give me my good habeas writ that I get -- can get from the State. Then I wipe out that conviction and I don't have it anymore. But the person who's been convicted, say, in whatever examples -- take -- Zimbabwe would be another example. Libya. To go back to that system and get a conviction expunged. That's why you can't use a case within the U.S. system where it's a question of where do you go to wipe out your prior conviction. And for someone abroad, there isn't that option.\n Justice Ginsburg, in Daniels v. United States, which dealt with 924, the sentencing enhancement provision, but it has a -- the parallel and incorporates 922(g)(1) convictions, this Court held -- a plurality of this Court held in divided opinions that -- in fact, that the -- the bar -- or that you still count an unconstitutional or allegedly unconstitutional State conviction, even if it was never appealed and that -- and there is no more opportunity for appeal. The time has passed. And under 922(g)(1), we also count.\n But that's -- that's a question of waiver or forfeiture. Those are the ordinary rules that apply.\n Yes, but that --\n But -- but there's a basic rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was rendered. And of course, you should abide by the timing rules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing within a federal union. If you're -- if you're attacking what State A does, go to State A, don't tell State C.\n And --\n But that -- that doesn't operate internationally.\n Well, it does certainly in this case. He could have appealed his conviction in Japan and he did not. So he had a forum to do that in. But --\n Yes, but you're not building that into your interpretation of the statute at all because you have said in your brief -- and correct me if I've got you wrong -- you don't like what the Third Circuit did. You say just the fact of the conviction counts. Don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair system that comports with fundamental notions of due process. Just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the world. And so what -- what you're telling me is that it doesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he were precluded from appealing for some reason that we would consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your view of this statute.\n That -- that's right, Justice Ginsburg, and that is -- you know, the -- the statute also bars receipt of firearms by anyone who's under indictment. And that application applies even though you can't appeal, except for exceptional circumstances. You can't appeal an indictment. And the 922(g)(1) bar, this Court's decision in Lewis made clear, is that it still applies unless and until your conviction is overturned. So you don't have to have had a -- a conviction vetted through the appellate process before the bar attaches. In -- in the immigration context --\n But that's -- that's standard for judgments anyway. When the judgment is final, it means you've gotten through the first -- it has preclusive effect. Almost always, when a judgment is overturned on appeal, then you go back to State 2 and say, look, it's been overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side, almost always State 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post-judgment relief because what we were relying on as our sister State judgment is no longer on the books. I can't imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the same way.\n Well, certainly in immigration and extradition, you don't get to appeal the validity of your foreign conviction or the -- the processes that led to it. So this is not an alien concept. And it's very important to understand what Congress was doing here. This isn't --\n I'm asking if it's alien in our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in -- extradition is somebody who did somebody -- something abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace. Don't we have to have a treaty?\n Right. We have treaties with more than 100 countries and we don't -- and -- and the courts do not examine the fairness of the proceedings or --\n Because the person is going to be tried in that other system, and we have bound -- within our international system, we say we're part of a world community and we want Japan to extradite people who have done bad things here to the United States, and so similarly, we will extradite to Japan. We don't want them to look at our system and judge it. We're sending somebody to be tried there. So extradition is -- is something entirely different than --\n Although we -- we do also extradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have already been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone could conceive or articulate. So --\n Well, we have the check already that these are -- these are places with whom we want to do criminal justice business together. So --\n Well, what we have is the check that the political branches have decided that it's important to attach significance to foreign court --\n And then we have the -- we have the document where it's very clear we want to have extradition with the UK, with Japan. Here, you're relying on the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out like you do in an extradition treaty. And that's the problem here. Sure, if Congress had said we mean foreign court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it means in the extradition context or the deportation context where you have a clear statement that Congress means a tribunal abroad.\n In fact, in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) which -- which -- admissibility criterion for aliens, convictions of moral turpitude, there's no reference to whether it's a conviction by a foreign court or a domestic court.\n But if somebody is coming into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to someplace abroad.\n No. No, it doesn't, Justice Ginsburg, because frequently and throughout that same statute, it refers to convictions in the United States. A lot of times the reason for inadmissibility, including the Mariel Cubans cases this Court heard last month, is -- is convictions committed in the United States.\n May -- may I interrupt this --\n Now, surely the context --\n -- this colloquy to raise another question, if I may? Would you concede that there are some tribunals in the world that are comparable to what you might call a kangaroo court that Congress would not have intended to include within the term court?\n Yes, Justice Stevens. And I think that's an important thing here. There has been no contest, for obvious reasons -- we're dealing with Japan -- as to what Congress meant by court. And sometimes if it's Saddam Hussein's --\n And how are we to decide whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory definition of the term court?\n Through traditional rules of statutory construction. I think that would involve looking at the other -- the -- the background that Congress would have enacted the statute against, first of all, and that -- that may well have -- it may not have been courts of just the United States because, as we know, Congress twice deleted that limitation from the statute.\n But if you concede that there are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court is inherently ambiguous?\n I -- I am -- I am conceding that -- that it has to be given meaning. I don't know that I would call it ambiguous, if we have to figure out. But I -- what I will say is that the phrase --\n But it's something less than the all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense.\n Any -- it has to be -- it has to be a court capable of entering convictions. I don't -- I don't think it's ambiguous in a sense --\n Well, I mean, it doesn't -- it's -- it's not a tennis court or an inner court. (Laughter.)\n Right.\n If -- if somebody asked where this man was convicted, they'd say in a Japanese court.\n Right. And -- and I think, in addition, we don't decide that a word is ambiguous just at looking at that word. We would look at the overall structure of the statute, and we would decide that it has to be a governmental entity capable of entering convictions.\n You didn't really have a chance --\n I assume that there's some prosecutorial discretion in the application of this statute. I mean, have you --\n Absolutely, Justice --\n -- have you prosecuted any -- any woman who tried to buy a firearm because she had been convicted of wearing -- not -- not wearing a veil?\n No, Justice Scalia.\n Do you think any United States attorney would do that?\n I would hope not, Justice Scalia. I think --\n Or -- or somebody who was convicted of treason in Cuba? You -- you think that -- that that would be a -- a case that would be prosecuted vigorously by a United States attorney?\n I -- I wouldn't think so. I think --\n Do you know any cases in which we've construed a statute narrowly on the ground that we're confident the prosecutor won't bring any such cases?\n That -- well, again, just last -- this isn't -- this isn't quite the same context. But just this -- just last term in the Cheney case, this Court recognized the limitations on prosecutors. And in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, in determining the scope of the Fourth Amendment and the capacity to arrest for misdemeanors, this Court recognized that not all checks have to come from the courts. They can come from the political process here. And it's very important to keep in mind that these hypothesized problems, bad applications, are that. Purely hypothesized. This has been on the books for almost 40 years.\n But it's -- it's been on the books for so long with very, very few prosecutions. So it's one -- it's not exactly an urgent question. But it does seem to me if this -- this problem had been brought to the attention of Congress, they would have defined the term court, and I don't -- they haven't done that but probably because they didn't think of the problem. And you can argue, well, they surely would have wanted to have this particular person prosecuted, but would they have wanted everyone with every foreign court all over the world. That's the question.\n And in Beecham v. United States, in Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court, this Court recognized there -- it was dealing with another issue, whether the jurisdiction that restores civil rights is different from the convicting jurisdiction. It said we don't have any way of knowing whether Congress thought about that. That's not the question. Congress passed a statute here. It passed a statute that's been written very carefully. It's passed a statute where the definition of the word any in the statute has already been defined. And the -- what the statute has been used for is to prosecute exactly the people that Congress wanted to capture. It's international gun smugglers --\n Ms. --\n -- violent assailants --\n Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, my -- my problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem with -- with the case is Congress did not just sort of stop when it got to the point that would support your Lewis argument. It went a step -- it went several steps further. But one of the steps further that it went to was -- was in -- in a certain fussiness about the definition of crime, and it said, well, we want to make sure that -- that no State or -- or Federal business criminals are -- are put at a disadvantage by this. It then accepted anything that a State might call a misdemeanor if it carried no more than 2 years. And it just seems very odd to me that Congress would have been that careful in putting these limitations on State and Federal crimes and would totally have ignored any category of crime under foreign law, any conviction under foreign law in -- in light of some of the hypotheses that have been thrown out this morning. It just seems strange that it would have ignored foreign law and foreign courts if it thought they were included.\n I don't think it's strange at all, Justice Souter, and that is because that the business exception, if I can call it that, is a carve-out. What you have here, in this Court's word, is a sweeping prophylaxis against the misuse of firearms. That's what this Court called it in Lewis, a sweeping prophylaxis. And what Congress did was back out --\n Well, it called it that, but it didn't -- it didn't have this issue in front of it.\n That's -- that's right.\n I -- I realize you've got the language, but it -- it wasn't addressing this issue.\n Right, and -- and the language should be what counts most. But beyond that, you're talking about Congress --\n Well, I was talking about our language.\n Right. You --\n But -- and I think that ought to count for a lot too. (Laughter.)\n Well, not too much.\n But what Congress was doing there was backing out. It was making an exception, and it was doing this against a backdrop of a lot of violence with guns. And so it makes sense that Congress would proceed carefully and deal with matters with which it was familiar and not want to carve out things that it wasn't familiar with.\n No, but how -- how familiar an example is it that price-fixers would -- would be placed in -- in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns? I mean, that was not a pressing problem, so far as I know. And yet, Congress dealt with it.\n Well, the problem --\n And if it can deal with a problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd that it would not have averted in any way to equally non-pressing problems under -- under foreign convictions if that's what they had in mind.\n It dealt with that. I mean, specifically at the legislative history level, it dealt -- it enacted that statutory exception because some States had made these types of business crimes punishable by more than a year. So that's what it was responding to.\n All right. What -- what --\n I can't -- I --\n No. I -- finish your answer.\n I can't -- I'm not going to stand here and tell you that Congress specifically thought about this.\n Oh, there's no --\n Right, but --\n We both know there's no --\n But -- but what Congress did here -- and it's very important to understand -- it was throwing a broad net --\n Ms. Millett.\n All right.\n Ms. Millett, there are many lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my generation -- some of them are of that elder age. We learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the penal judgments of another. This is a kind of enforcement of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something like it. Another reason why I would expect a Congress, knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant foreign, foreign. Unlike the context of the immigration, yes, there are some people who left and came back, but many -- and -- and we have all this whole line of cases. Is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know, those go back to the '20's. But this, which came about only because of the merger of two statutes, one saying Federal and State, the other not, and no explanation at all, in light of all these anomalies that have been brought out. Shouldn't we say to Congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you did, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in foreign?\n Two answers, Justice Ginsburg. First, this was the second time in 1986 that Congress refused to include that limitation on courts. The prior law, before the 1968 act, specifically referred to courts of the United States, States, and territories. It did not pick up that language in title IV in 1968, and they took it out --\n But neither did it give any explanation for not carrying it forward.\n No, but I don't -- that --\n It's -- it's the silence at the -- at the time it -- it apparently departed from the practice of predecessor statutes that -- that seems to be a problem for your argument.\n But -- but again, I don't think this Court has ever characterized as silence Congress' twice deletion of language from a statute in 1968 and again in 1986. It had it. It looked at it. It took it out. And in 1986 in the Senate report that you were referring to, Justice Ginsburg, earlier, Congress said they -- the conference report said we are rejecting the Senate's definition of felony. The other thing to keep in mind is when Congress enacted this statute in 1968, it also enacted an administrative mechanism for relief that would deal with exactly the uncomfortable situations that have been identified. 925(c) allows an administrative waiver in cases where an individual comes and says I don't want to --\n You know, this is a very interesting case because there are three ways to answer the question of what is a court. You can leave it up to us to do it, and that would be judicial legislation to fill in a hole in the statute. You can have the executive do it, decide what case -- what cases to prosecute, or if we should knock out this -- interpret the statute in the -- in a different way than you urge, Congress would then do it. Now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on deciding which is the -- what should the meaning of the word court be? The executive, the legislature, or the judiciary?\n I think -- it's, of course, the legislature and the President's signature. I'd like to put a plug in for the executive in -- in that reference, but --\n That would save us a lot of work. We -- (Laughter.)\n -- we could just invalidate all statutes that we don't understand. (Laughter.)\n But, Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens, the important thing to keep in mind here is we don't just have a statute that appeared out of nowhere. It's been on the books for a long time and there was a legislative --\n No, but it is pretty clear that Congress didn't really think about this problem.\n No, but it thought -- it --\n And it is also clear on your side that they would like to prevent this guy from having a gun.\n Exactly, and --\n So there are two competing considerations, both of which are very powerful.\n Well, if nothing else -- and this guy is squarely within what Congress wanted to capture. If nothing else, you don't have to decide anything more in this case than that it covers persons like this whose convictions are fundamentally fair and it's not contested and could leave for another day -- but let's --\n Can I -- I want to get you. Now, I have a new question.\n Would -- would you finish -- would you finish please --\n Well, I have a new --\n -- telling us about the administrative waiver proceeding? You were in the middle of it and I never heard the --\n That's exactly what I wanted to know.\n Right.\n And I -- can I -- that's exactly what I wanted to know. When a person comes in to get a gun -- because I hadn't focused on this, and it actually to me it's relevant. Suppose one of these people has been convicted in a foreign court and he doesn't have a clue, you know, that this means he can't buy a gun over here. So he comes over here. He goes into a -- a gun store. Now, does he get notice that that -- this conviction over in Japan or Lithuania or wherever it was means that he can't buy the gun?\n Well, he got -- in this case, he got -- and this is --\n No. I'm asking -- I'm asking in general.\n You -- you go and you fill out a form that says, as this case did -- and it's on page 4 of our brief --\n Yes.\n -- asked him, have you been convicted in any court of --\n So it just says any court.\n In any court. And I think when someone --\n Well --\n No. But when someone has a conviction, when you have a felony conviction, you're on some notice of inquiry.\n It'll work for -- yes. It'll -- it'll work for this one, but -- but what I'm worried about -- and really what led the Sentencing Commission to exclude all this stuff even though clearly recidivists should get a higher sentence, but we still excluded it because it's just a nightmare. There are notice problems. There are fairness problems. There are procedural problems. There are problems of crimes that aren't crimes here.\n Justice --\n And -- and all those come up, and that's what I'm worried about. So I see this as a possible out.\n Well --\n The one -- the procedure you just talked about might help.\n And it's in 925(c), which is on --\n That he knows about it.\n -- page 65a of our brief. But let me -- let me be --\n And it provides judicial review of the Attorney General's failure to give the waiver.\n It does, and -- but let me be candid up front. Congress stopped funding this administrative mechanism in 1992, and that -- this Court addressed that in the Bean case. It -- it doesn't exist now, but that was 25 years after Congress wrote this language and put it in the statute, and the fact that they stopped funding it 25 years later doesn't mean the statute doesn't mean what it said.\n Do you know why?\n And Congress --\n Do you know why they stopped funding it? Why did -- because I think that's been reenacted every year. No money for this. Why -- why did Congress stop funding it?\n Because some of -- some of the people who were getting waivers were going out and committing crimes again. Congress here is very concerned about public safety. And this is not -- there was, you know, the question, is there ever an element where you treat this like an element of foreign crime. There aren't -- there aren't crimes normally where you treat indictments or someone being under a restraining order this way. This is not punishing you for your foreign crime. This is a global categorical, class-wide judgment that as a class persons who have committed crimes overseas are more dangerous and may pose exactly the public safety risk we wanted to grab and stop. As a class, they do that. In a particular case, it may not. In a particular case, an indictment might not. Congress was speaking globally. It did so. It threw a broad net. It did so at the time it had an administrative check to deal with these problems. Yes, that's gone. That doesn't retroactively change what the statutory language meant. This Court has said time and time again that this statutory language in 922 was written, in Beecham and Huddleston, with such care that Congress was focused on the difference between the present perfect and the past tense, this Court said in Barrett. This is not sloppy writing. When Congress put any court in and did not carry forward a limitation to the courts of the United States and took that out in another part of the statute in 1986, we have to assume that Congress knew what it was doing. If there are problems here, there is a political process to deal with it. The political process has taken away the administrative waiver. But there has not been -- this hypothesis of bad applications has not arisen. It's hypothesized. And what this statute has -- has been used to do is capture exactly the people Congress wanted to capture. It got exactly the ones who should be disarmed.\n Do you know anybody in the Justice Department you might talk to to amend this form so that the form says this includes convictions in foreign countries?\n I -- I am confident that the ATF would be happy to do that. As of now, the ATF has a regulation on the books for someone to look at and see that includes foreign convictions in this definition. And I think when someone has been convicted, they're on notice. Thank you, Justice Stevens.\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n"}
