{"argument in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus Coke ": " Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Because title to lands underlying navigable waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty, this Court has long held that there is a strong presumption that each State receives title to such lands at statehood. Under the Court's precedents, the United States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise made that intention very plain. Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case, the United States asserts that it received title to the submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title. To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the United States identifies as ratifying the purported reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains with Alaska. Under the plain language of the statute, the proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause. And this is important. In this case it is undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included within the main clause. The submerged lands, therefore, did not  \n Well, counsel, you   apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section 5  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n   of the statehood act.\n Absolutely.\n And why was Federal title to the monument not sufficient to retain title to the submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e) at all?\n Because of section 6(m), Your Honor. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides that the Federal Government retained all of the property it previously possessed with one important exception, except as provided in section 6. Section 6 has two exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here. Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the States. Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different set of properties. What section 6(e) did was to transfer to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of property, property that was used for the purposes or solely   for the sole purpose of   of fish and wildlife conservation under three designated statutes. Those are the State   local-State fish and wildlife conservation statutes. Again, here it was   it is undisputed that Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause. Therefore, the  \n   problem, as   you just said that   that the main clause is very, very narrow, and we're told by the Government that no wildlife reservation would come within that main clause, so that there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.\n The Government is incorrect, Your Honor. We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the proviso. And here's why the United States is correct on that. They argue in their brief that those properties were not included in the main clause because they were created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the Alaska Game Law of 1943. In fact, Your Honors, those are the exact same statute. The '43 Alaska Game Law simply restated the 1925 law with certain amendments. What that means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the then-existing version. These refuges were created in 1941 prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. So those are two properties. And   and actually the legislative history   we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative history because the statute is plain and also because there's a clear statement rule. But the legislative history does indicate that Congress was specifically concerned about those two very large refuges. The Kenai and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut. And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern of the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not be able adequately to manage those properties. But there was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at issue here because it was never going to be transferred to the State under the main clause.\n Why   why shouldn't we look to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?\n We are advocating the tests set out in the Idaho case, Your Honor. That test is a two-pronged test.\n Right.\n First, you have to look and see if there is a  \n Whether Congress has notice of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation, which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?\n That's   that's relevant to the first prong, Your Honor. The second prong  \n And second, whether the transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that reservation. Should we look to that?\n If the Court were examining the   the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors might be relevant. Here, though, the test is set out in not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress. And Idaho applies that. Idaho looked very carefully for some action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that case. Here, we need an action by Congress. The United States has identified what they contend is the action of Congress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act. That proviso, though, just does not cover these lands.\n Why do you say explicit? I   I thought it said you have to make it plain, which really might matter.\n In  \n What it says   the language I think is   or definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.\n Yes. In the  \n Is that right? There's nothing that says explicit. Right?\n Well, Your Honor, in the Alaska case   and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997 Alaska case. There the Court said that Congress must, quote, explicitly recognize or that Congress had explicitly recognized the resignation in that case. So the   the Court  \n But doesn't that simply mean that if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.\n Yes.\n But it doesn't mean that it must be explicit in every case. Isn't that correct?\n Well, I   I think explicit  \n You don't have to be explicit to make it plain. It's a great way to do it, but that's   it's not the only way.\n It has to be definitely   Justice Breyer, you're correct. It has to be  \n All right.\n   definitely clear or otherwise made plain. Yes.\n If I'm correct, then   if I'm correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here we have a national park and we want to keep the national parks as the United States, which you'd expect. It's a national park. And of course, they want to keep the whole thing. I mean, it's obvious. You don't have to write everything that's obvious. They no more want to give all the water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give the gamekeeper's part to Alaska. A house, or maybe there's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention either, but it's just obvious that unless there's something very special about the water, that the water in the park is part of the park.\n Well, there is something special about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has recognized. The water is a State   an essential attribute of State sovereignty, and just to  \n I understand that. But I mean, it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're giving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's even underground water. But I mean, what the argument I think is   would be is this like that, and the argument that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need this water in order to study the glaciers because there are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora and fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's good enough. Now, what's your reply?\n First of all, the geysers are not included because we're talking about navigable  \n I understand that. I'm using a funny example to  \n Yes. Navigable waters. (Laughter.)\n But let me   let me just assure the Court. There is nothing at all unusual about State-owned submerged lands within national monuments. The reason is simple. The Antiquities Act, which allows the President to designate national monuments, was enacted in 1906. At that time there were 45 States already in the Union. Therefore, any national monument created in those 45 States would necessarily have included State-owned submerged lands unless there had been some conveyance. And let   let me give Your Honors a   a concrete example. In the 1978 California decision decided by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national monument off the coast of California, included State-owned submerged lands because even though the reservation order was asserted to have included those lands, there was no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the State's title. Another  \n Like in Yellowstone. There is a river I think. Who owns that?\n Well, Yellowstone was created before the State of Wyoming and  \n No. But I mean, does the State or the Feds own the   the river that goes through it?\n One would need to examine the particular reservations and statutes there.\n What about in Yosemite? I think there's a river down there too. Is the river in Yosemite owned by California or by the   the Feds?\n I'm not familiar with that, but I will give you an example that I am familiar with.\n Before you do that, Mr. Franklin, is   is the rule that   that we're operating under that Congress had to have made it clear  \n Yes.\n   that it reserved, or is the rule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved it?\n No. It's the former rule, Your Honor.\n It's the former.\n Yes.\n So the mere fact that it doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n Right, but normally you assume, I guess, that Congress does what is   tries to avoid things that are ridiculous. So if they say keep the park, I guess the question would be is that included. I mean  \n It's not  \n   can you read it this way? I   I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?\n Well, first of all, this is not the ordinary   in this case we presumed the   the opposite. In fact, there's a strong presumption. But let me give you the other example that I was going to refer to you.\n Yes.\n There's something called the California Coastal National Monument. That extends the entire length of California and goes out 12 miles to sea. In that monument, the   the lands, the submerged lands, are both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they are managed cooperatively. And that's what we are seeking to do here. And importantly, the fact  \n Mr. Franklin, are   are these submerged lands covered by navigable waters?\n Yes.\n What is it that the Government could do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want to do, that they cannot do simply by   by reason of   of having jurisdiction over the navigable waters?\n There are a few things, presumably very localized activities that the State would have the exclusive authority in. Importantly though, the Federal Government, even though the State owns title here, will retain all of its constitutional authority under the Interstate Commerce Clause to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce that  \n Yes, but just as a practical matter, tell us what you're arguing about. What does Alaska think it can do if it prevails in the Glacier Monument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical matter?\n As   as a practical matter, there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing that are important to the State. There are issues relating to local uses of the bay. But more importantly  \n Well, could   could you be concrete? I mean, there   I don't know what you mean. What are the issues? Can you give me an explicit example?\n Well, one explicit example is I think the State would prefer to have more local subsistence fishing in the bay. And the Court   to   to move out a bit, the  \n So the State would permit more fishing than the U.S. would allow  \n I think  \n   as a practical matter.\n As a practical matter. And   and there   there  \n But couldn't Congress forbid that under   by reason of its control of the navigable waters  \n Well, if  \n   if it really wanted to?\n If Congress really wanted to, Congress could   could affect activities relating to interstate commerce. But importantly, what Alaska seeks here really is a seat at the table. Right now Alaska has no say over anything that happens in its navigable waters which are its sovereign State lands. What it seeks really is to have its views being considered. Right now   and I'll give you a concrete example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the   in the next count that I'll discuss. For some time cruise ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside   or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of Federal laws. That was fixed, but it took an act of Congress to do that. There had to be an act of Congress to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge out in these, what they used to call, donut holes. Alaska finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress every time something comes up on its navigable waters that it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with. Now, if Congress decides to preempt the State under its interstate commerce power, it has the right to do that. I think we also need to keep in mind what waters we're talking about. This is southeast Alaska. The waters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the region. They are central to the economy, the history, the society, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live there and who travel there. Just to take an example, there are still today very few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the   the towns and the cities like the   the State capital of Juneau historically were accessible only by the water. This is an area   the water in particular is an area that is of great importance to Alaska. And they are seeking to confirm that that area does belong to Alaska. And I think we have set forth in quite detail why  \n Well, there   there are big differences between the   the analysis concerning the bays that you assert and Glacier Monument. I think they're quite different.\n Well, the   the tests are different. The Glacier Bay test involves   needs to have an explicit reservation   explicit ratification by Congress of a reservation and  \n You're lumping them all together, but I think the tests are quite different.\n The tests are different. What I was trying to explain is, in answer to Your Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska. It matters quite a deal.\n But in   in respect to Glacier Bay  \n Yes.\n   I   I mean, is the only   you said, for example   is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?\n There are two issues. I think it's fishing and also to allow more local people to visit the area that would otherwise be prohibited by the Park Service. There was   but just to assure Your Honors  \n How could they do that? You mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water there, but they couldn't get off the boat?\n Well, that's normally what   what people do is they just visit the  \n I see.\n   by boats. But to assure Your Honor, there   for example, there are no mineral interests here anywhere in the picture.\n All right. So if   if the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat and to go up along the waterway and to look at the glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska, for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left of the park. I mean, it would be like   you see, if it's essential to it.\n Well, that's not true, Your Honor. 80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it included the submerged lands, is uplands. But it's no more unusual  \n No. I understand that, but I mean, it's the way of visiting the park.\n Yes, but I just mentioned, for example, the two monuments in California. The Channel Islands National Monument this Court held included the   the submerged lands were State-owned. There's no other way to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse State-owned submerged lands. In fact, I think there are few national parks in this country you can't get to without going across State lands. I think there's another important point here and that is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also allow the Federal Government to regulate activities on lands that abut national parks to the extent that they might affect park activities. But here what we need is an expressed statement by Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay. Without that, Your Honors   and the   the precedents are clear. Without that, the presumption is   in fact, the strong presumption is   that these are State-owned lands. And again, there is absolutely nothing unusual. That is part of our Federal system. It's the way that these monument properties have been managed since 1906 when the President first got the authority. It's the way that Glacier Bay will continue to be managed. We expect, we intend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government to resolve any issues that might remain. What we're seeking here, again, is a seat at the table. We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealt with because they are the owner.\n In the   in the '97 case, was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)? Because this  \n Yes. The   the Court expressly stated that it was at pages 60 to 61, and that was in the absence of any contrary argument.\n It   it made an assumption.\n The Court made an assumption, but in fact  \n But was it in fact?\n I think there would have been a substantial   had that   had that issue been litigated, there would have been a substantial argument that it was not within the main clause. But again, there was no argument on that point before the Court. The Court at pages 60 to 61 expressly stated   again, it was an assumption, but the Court expressly stated that the lands were within the main clause. Apparently the Court was considering the fact that the application for ANWR did, in fact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the main clause, the Alaska Game Law. The important point of that case for this case, though, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here, namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal Government a subset of the properties that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause. There simply was no need for Congress to have expressed an intent  \n I thought we had left that open. I thought we  \n I think what I said is that the Court embraced that position, and it was actually an essential attribute of the   essential premise for the Court's holding. At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the   the decision, what the Court made clear is it was concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso, all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was covered by the proviso. No such concern is present here. I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I might, to the count I, which is the historic waters count. There the United States asserts that at statehood the waters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated enclaves of international high seas that were wholly surrounded by U.S. territorial waters. The historical record, though, belies that contention. At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States took what this Court has described in the Mississippi Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as the publicly stated policy that the waters of the archipelago were inland and that the political boundary ran along the outside edge. Thereafter, the United States took   consistently based a discriminatory enforcement regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. What I mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.\n Well, the argument on the other side, as I understand it, is that the   the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is   is relevant. It has no necessary implication for the historic waters doctrine. What   what is your answer to that?\n That's the assertion. My answer is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975 decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202, and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief. What the Court said there is it examined an incident in which a Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general area, and the Court said   and I quote   that incident deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and, quote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the waters in question.\n What   what page was that?\n I'm sorry. That's 201 to 202   201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of the blue brief. What the law was at statehood is that the United States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign vessels. Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that is that the law has changed. The law has changed since 1971. Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a 200-mile   what's known as an exclusive economic zone that allows the United States to enforce discriminatory fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that. But   and we have quoted a UN study. In fact, the UN study that we have quoted   and that is noted at page 29 of the blue brief. That is the study that's called the Juridical Regime Study. It's the study that this Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases, has used as the authoritative statement of the law. That study quite clearly states that if a   if a country enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign vessels outside   that that manifests an assertion of an historic inland waters claim. And what we have here  \n On   on this point, it seems to me there   unlike the first point you were discussing where I think the Federal Government can work its will anyway, on this point there is really a significant Federal interest involved. That is to say, if the United States takes the position that these are, indeed, inland waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.\n No. Your Honor, they assert that, but they don't provide any specific examples. And the reason they can't provide a specific example of any instance abroad where it would affect their position is that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own facts. The fact that something is an archipelago does not render it historic waters.\n But   but you say a determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply   is simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.\n It is a claim to the   to the waters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with discriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other statements in this case, including the California brief to this Court. There has to be an   excuse me   an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before one can conclude that waters are historic waters. These ones are. Other waters would not be. The United States has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely these constellation of facts. So its   its position is basically: we say it, therefore it must be so. I  \n But it's not the United States that will be making the judgment about what areas are controlled. It would be the country abroad. And I   I think the argument was, what the United States does other nations will copy.\n Right.\n And they will decide what looks like the Alaska  \n Right. What the United States does, Your Honor, is follow the well-settled international law on historic bays   historic waters. Those are set forth in the convention. Each state will have the same authority where its facts and circumstances dictate it. If there has been a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the acquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as historic waters. But it has to be done based on a   an examination of the particular facts of the case. And one thing else   one thing other that is worth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a nation can always close it off using article 4 straight baselines. That is permitted under the convention. The U.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are fully able to do that. I think that if the United States is going to be arguing that there is some international precedent here that's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a particular body water abroad that it believes this case is going to affect.\n Why should it make that suggestion? It would certainly not be in the interest of the United States.\n Well, it   it needs to explain more specifically then, other than just stating we think it might affect our position. The   the facts and circumstances   the Court, for example, applied the historic bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the Mississippi Sound case. I am aware of no instance in which that precedent was ever used adversely and the United States has not identified any   any instance. But more importantly, what this Court did in the Mississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it said is this a historic bay or is it not. The Court concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the Court follows. At this point, I'd like to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.\n Yes, Mr. Franklin. Mr. Minear.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin with the focal point of Alaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park. Alaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the statehood act does not provide an adequate showing that the United States intended to retain the submerged lands in Glacier Bay. For this  \n Could   before you go into that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?\n Yes. In fact, I think it's very helpful. It's listed at page 7a  \n I mean, (e)  \n   of our   of the gray brief.\n Yes, but the   well   well, the   the introduction to it is   is not listed, is it? I mean  \n That may   that may be so.\n I mean, it's incomplete. It   it just says all real and   what about all real and personal property? Is there an intro that says there is hereby   there is hereby granted to the United   to Alaska?\n Well, 6(e) I think begins stating that this   these are exceptions to section 5 which is the retention   the general retention provision of the United   for United States lands. But if we look at 6(e) itself, it's  \n Well, you say they're exceptions. How   how are the exceptions introduced? I mean, it's incomplete to just read (e) that says all   what about all real and personal property of the United States? There has to be some introductory language. What is it?\n No. Actually there doesn't, Your Honor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal property   then you skip down, about halfway down   shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropriate Federal agency. So it is   so this is complete in terms of  \n Okay. Okay. You're right.\n But if I could walk you through those provisions because I think they're quite important. The first provision says, as you say, all real and personal property which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall be transferred to the United States.\n Right.\n It's followed by another provision here.\n To   to Alaska.\n To   to Alaska. Excuse me. And it's followed by another proviso which says that the United States will continue to control fish and game matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has certified that Alaska is ready to do so. Clearly that proviso is not a subset  \n Mr. Minear, before you get too far, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that was raised by Justice O'Connor before. Do you agree that section 5 itself, the second part of it that says the United States retains title to its own property, that the response to that is adequately provided in the Submerged Lands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?\n No, I don't. I don't believe   let me frame the   your   your question, if I may, for you. Section 5 indicates the United States would retain all of the lands that it presently holds. Section 6(m) then makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the   to the   to Alaska. In doing so, it recognizes that there are some lands the United States would continue to retain, provided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands Act. The particular exception we're concerned about here is the expressly retained exception, in other words, if lands are retained by the United States. This Court said in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts the general law that applied before the Submerged Lands Act, that it had to be made plain that the United States would be holding onto these lands. It doesn't require an express statement. It simply requires that it be made plain. Now, our view is that these lands would be retained by the United States, quite apart from 6   the 6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary judgment. And if you denied our motion for summary judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions that are applicable. But in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e) and we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic Coast decision made clear that 6(e)   and I quote   reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote, to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife   or reservations for the protection of wildlife.\n Well, we didn't have this issue before us. Let   let me  \n Yes, we did.\n   let me   why don't you go back to your argument? You said that the first proviso on its face is simply not a subset of the first part of (e).\n Yes. It's an example how provisos do not need to be  \n But that's not the proviso at issue here.\n Yes.\n The proviso at issue here is the second proviso which begins provided that such transfer shall not include lands. Such transfer. Now, this is   the word such refers you back to something. What   what possible transfer could it mean except the end of the introduction, which says shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska?\n Your Honor  \n I mean, anybody reading that would   would think that proviso refers to that transfer or at least it is not clear that it provides to   that it applies to every transfer in   in the whole act.\n I disagree with you, Justice Scalia, for these reasons. First of all, the such transfer simply tells you what's not included. That language tells you   this is outside. It doesn't mean that whatever follows necessarily was within the main clause. What Congress was doing here, by making clear that these lands were not transferred  \n What does the such refer to?\n It does refer to the transfer before. But what follows here, refuges and reservations for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within that   that main clause. It's obvious they don't because the only things that fit within the main clause are those lands and real property specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. What we're talking about here   wildlife reservations are multiple purpose lands. They're not used solely for   for the purpose of conservation. The purpose of the first provision here was to transfer vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State would need to enforce Alaska game laws. That was the point of   of that first provision. But Secretary Chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative history that what he was doing was drawing a line between those   those facilities and equipment that are used by a State in its traditional game management and drawing a contrast with the matters that would be retained by the United States.\n Where is the language that says that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained by the United States?\n We do not need  \n What the proviso says is just what Justice Scalia said.\n We do not need express language that expresses  \n No, no, but where is the implication in that?\n The implication is that we are retaining all of the reservation. And this is what the Court said in the Arctic Coast decision. It saw that this was  \n That's   that's   it   I mean, in   in   I take it in the Alaska case we were considering a transfer that did fall within the main sentence of (e).\n Justice Breyer, neither party made that argument. This issue came up in a letter that was written after. The   the language  \n Were we or weren't we?\n You were not considering that.\n We weren't.\n That   that was   simply neither party suggested that ANWR fell within the first provision. And it doesn't. It's clear that it doesn't. It was not land that was specifically used solely for conservation of wildlife under these three listed statutes. The ANWR reservation at that time was set apart. It was BLM land. It was also used for mining and other activities. Likewise, the other matters  \n But the Court did assume   the Court did assume that.\n Yes.\n It made that assumption with no briefing, but it did that with regard to the second issue that was presented there. The issue that people were fighting about in the Arctic Coast decision was was this land properly set apart or not for purposes of the proviso. And that's where this discussion takes place.\n All right. Then  \n It's an afterthought that simply reinforces.\n All right. Then at best Alaska is a neutral. Because we didn't think it, we're operating as a mistake. It's a neutral. Okay. Now, what's bothering me about the case is just what Justice Scalia said, that   that why I   if I sell you all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping gear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation of mess kits from some other transfer? I mean, it has nothing to do with mess kits.\n Your Honor, but that's   it's clear that what this is   this is more along the lines if someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that transfer shall not include the detached garage.\n Fine, and then it doesn't go in that.\n In that case  \n But it doesn't mean that the next  \n Yes, but it was not a part of the house.\n Yes.\n You know, that's   it's just providing clarification, just that one of the purposes of the proviso is to provide clarification.\n This is an abundance of caution?\n In other   that is exactly right. And we can tell that from  \n All right. If it's an abundance of caution, where's the other language that almost reserves it so we need the caution?\n That would be section 5. It indicates the general retention for lands of this sort.\n But 5 is subject to the Submerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you back to the reservation has to be explicit. And then   see, that's  \n Well, Justice Breyer, again, if I can just complete the point  \n That's why I was talking about Yellowstone.\n Yes.\n I was looking for something that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to transfer. He comes back and says, well, very often States do control the water.\n Your Honor, I just need to make a point. I think it's very important for you to understand this point. First of all, that at page 57 of the Arctic Coast decision, this Court was clearly reading this language, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a clear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that these particular items that are discussed there are not a part of the main clause and cannot be. And a good example of that is the third thing that's being transferred, facilities that are utilized in connection with general research activities related to fisheries and wildlife. Now, that is not going to be something that's specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. It's the antithesis of that. It makes quite clear that our construction is correct. The subset theory just doesn't work because the items that are here are not things that fit within the main clause. What Congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line  \n But why   why doesn't (m) supersede that argument anyway? Let's   can't we say that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?\n Then you have to explain what happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main provision. And that is because Congress was making   because this Court concluded that Congress was making clear that wildlife lands are very important and they wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not be transferred. And even a provision that could be misconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in   in Arctic Coast   could be misconstrued to contain some of these lands, we need to make adequate assurance that   that the courts that read this realize a clear division is being made. We are retaining these wildlife lands. That's  \n Mr. Minear, I'm   I'm not sure I agree with you that   that that language, facilities used in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the earlier   of the earlier grant, namely property used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of fisheries and wildlife. Surely one   one can readily regard general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and protecting fisheries and wildlife.\n But we're talking about a facility here. So a facility that might conduct some   some research tangentially related to wildlife is not a facility that's used for the sole   specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife. There's a clear difference here. These two   these two sets do not overlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife refuges. Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are used for multiple purposes. At the time of statehood, the   the regulations in place, the fisheries regulations and wildlife regulations, made clear that permits could be issued for purposes apart from wildlife conservation. And this Court's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized that one of the   the refuges that Alaska cites as being included in the main clause was being used for oil and gas purposes. It was not being used solely for the purposes   specifically used solely for the purposes of conservation.\n Mr. Minear, you know, I   I am just overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible mess of a statute. I can't figure out what it means.\n Well, Your Honor  \n And   and it seems to me that's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.\n Your Honor  \n There are arguments here, there are arguments there, but it   it does not dawn upon me that   that anything is clear about this at all.\n Well, this   we believe the statute has been clear for 50 years. That's why these issues have only arisen recently with regard to Glacier Bay National Park.\n Mr. Minear, what do you say are the practical consequences from the Federal Government's perspective of going   of disagreeing with the U.S. position? What harm is done? Can the U.S. protect itself in any event under other clauses?\n We agree that the United States has the regulatory authority to protect   to limit vessel entries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not what our concern is. Our concern is with the actual use of the submerged lands. This is a laboratory. This is a laboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use the submerged lands for that purpose. That includes such things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze its historic features. We've installed a 5-mile cable with a hydrophone on the   on the submerged lands so we can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the   the volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that migrate through there.\n Don't you do that on   on dry land in some States?\n Your Honor, in order to hear vehicle traffic  \n Doesn't your authority under the Commerce Clause or under   under   over navigable waters allow you to do that kind of stuff?\n Your Honor, we think that   that Alaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot withdraw materials from the submerged land which we use and study. And in fact, I would point out that the park superintendent's affidavit  \n Are they likely to do that?\n What?\n Are they likely to do that? Is this a real problem?\n There are 900 papers, scientific papers, that are cited in the affidavit of the park superintendent. This is exhibit number 8 on count IV. And of those describing the type of research we do in Glacier Bay National Park  \n Well, I thought  \n   scores and perhaps hundreds of those involve submerged lands.\n All right. Given what you're saying   and I   you're not accepting this I think, and I   well, there is language in this act which maintains in the United States title to the park.\n That is correct.\n All right. Now, I would have thought when you get title to the park, you mean the park, and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the park.\n We  \n And therefore, if you have a part of the park which is the only part of the park where people look at the park, and it's the only part of the park that brings them into the park, and it's the only part of the park where you do the research, et cetera, that's the park. Just as if I were to sell my house and I list the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen is an essential part of the house.\n That's  \n Now   now, once I made that argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but really, there are all kinds of instances where States have reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's worked fine.\n But those are instances  \n What's your response to all this?\n The instances   the examples they're giving are cases in which we've created those national monuments or parks after statehood. And in those cases, we cannot acquire those lands because they have already been transferred to the State at statehood.\n It hasn't resulted in a   in a disaster. That's the point that Justice Breyer is making.\n But in this case  \n It has not resulted in a disaster.\n But in this case, it is going to impede the   the activities we have there. And a good example of this is in the amicus brief at page 25 where Alaska does not even assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife. The Alaska legislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife within the park. This gives you some sense of the type of difficulties that we're going to encounter.\n Mr.  \n And our chief concern  \n Mr. Minear, may I ask you? At the time the statute was passed, was the national Government conducting these activities?\n Yes, it was. It was created as a national monument. Now, in terms of what degree of activities, the record is not clear, but we're  \n Maybe you were monitoring passages through to see whether the whales were going to be interfered with and doing that sort of thing. Were you taking core samples?\n We were definitely studying the bed of the lake, and our   our briefs below explain. We have an affidavit from our glaciologist which describes the type of research that was being done.\n So in   in other words, you   you're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the passage, this would have been on the congressional mind, going back to Justice Breyer's  \n It   it definitely would have. And also I want to point out that when we created the national monument, we also preserved such things as the interglacial forests. These are forests that are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go forward over these submerged lands. The glacial forests are in the submerged lands, and so they become a part of it. As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely that other glacial forests will be revealed, and those should remain a part of the park. That was part of the purpose, was to study those  \n Should. Now, you're not   how far are you prepared to go? You can't go more than your brief and your facts justify. Are you prepared to say that this water is an essential part of the park?\n Yes.\n Yes?\n Yes. Certainly  \n Have you said that before this minute?\n Not only have we said it, but the Park Service at statehood said that this is a water park when they were describing these lands and saying why they should be retained. They told Congress   the   the park superintendent or the   the director of the Park Service said this is a water park that's mostly   this is, after all, Glacier Bay National Park. And in that   with that respect, I'd like to point out this  \n Why did they keep the other 80 percent then?\n Excuse me, Your Honor.\n Why did they keep the other 80 percent?\n Well, the  \n I gather only 20 percent of it is water.\n It's slightly more than 20  \n They should have given away the rest.\n We haven't given away. We have all of these lands. The   the uplands here are the glaciers and the mountains that are inaccessible except by the water. You cannot reach these areas. There are no roads in this park except for the park visitors center, and beyond that  \n Then make it a water park. I mean, you want to say it's a   it's a water-accessible park, fine.\n Yes. But, Your Honor, the  \n 20 percent of the park is under water. Right?\n More than 20 percent. Roughly 25. I'd say close to 25 percent of the park is   within the park boundaries is submerged lands. But there's another point I'd like to make with regard to the establishment of the park. This park was created under the Antiquities Act, and under the Antiquities Act, the President is given authority to create national monuments, but they cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress. Now, Congress could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to give up the land. It could have disestablished some part of it, and it chose not to do so. And yet, that's another indication that Congress was intending to retain these lands. Now, I would like to move on to the other two counts we have here, unless we have further questions about   about Glacier Bay. But I   I think one thing that I do   one thought I want you   to leave you with with regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are essential to the park. They are understood to be essential at the time that the park was created. And the   the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one with regard to this park. Those lands are   continue to be used   the submerged lands for scientific research that is vitally important. Now, I'd like to point out that the master also correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits are historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska failed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test. This Court specifically failed to show a continuous assertion of   of sovereignty to exclude vessels that have   that are visiting the park or passing through in innocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of foreign nations. During the past 150-year period, neither Alaska nor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel based on   merely on innocent passage. Rather, Alaska   Alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we unambiguously did so. The only  \n Alaska is arguing, as I understand it now, that the   the exclusion for purposes of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a matter of international law, which is a point that you disagree on. What   what is your response to their response to  \n The answer is in order to establish a historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage. Fisheries is not   engaging in fishing activity under the convention is not innocent passage. And so, therefore, an exclusion based on fisheries can never   can never give rise to a claim of  \n And what's   what's your best authority for that?\n Well, our best authority is the convention itself. The convention makes clear under article 14 that fisheries is   that fisheries activities are not innocent passage. Rather, innocent passage is merely transit through from one point to another. Moreover, the Marguerite incident that they describe involves a single incident; that is, it does not satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland   the historic inland waters test requires. And finally, it also didn't satisfy the acquiescence test since the British Government protested the seizure of the ship. And finally on top of that, this vessel   we don't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that it was seized. There continues to be a dispute and the master was unable to determine whether that   the ship was in   inside or outside the 3-mile limit. Now, I'd also like to speak briefly to the juridical   juridical bay claim as well. This is a matter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine it would address on rebuttal. The master correctly rejected Alaska's extraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be turned into two large   large juridical bays. And basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland on an island. Now, that does not suffice the purpose of the convention. The only way that it can establish a bay headland or   or closing point is by showing that it's on the mainland. In order to establish that this is on the mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of water. And as the master recognized, these bodies of water are simply too substantial to ignore. In the case of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on average 4 and a half miles wide. It's   simply those intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish that this is   is part of the mainland. It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which is a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for international navigation. That too precludes it from being ignored and treated as dry land. The failure of those two assimilations by itself is sufficient to establish that   that these   that these juridical bays do not exist. And even if that were not enough, the master went on to say that this would not be a well-marked indentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate these lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would not be   the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is passing by. For all those reasons, the juridical bays here are   are simply not well founded, and the master was correct in rejecting them. So what we see  \n Mr. Minear, could I go back to Glacier  \n Certainly, Your Honor.\n   Park again for a moment and ask why the Government decided to base its claim to the lands in Glacier Bay exclusively on that murky provision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards set out in the Idaho case?\n Well, Your Honor  \n Do you   do you not rely on that standard  \n Quite  \n   of analysis?\n Quite honestly we thought that under the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required to create absolutely new   no new law. It had already interpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e) applied to this case. We think the Idaho provisions provide another opportunity for us to establish it. It's quite clear that the purposes of the   the lands here, the submerged lands, are so essential to the park that it's simply inconceivable that Congress would have intended for those lands to pass out of ownership. However, we relied on  \n Would you   would you tell us again why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you still go back before the   the Special Master to show certain facts?\n Well, first of all, Alaska has not moved for summary judgment. We moved for summary judgment on some of our theories. Other theories would require some factual development. One of the theories that we would   we would go forward with is that these lands are occupied under a claim of right, and that's another exception under the Submerged Lands Act. In addition, we would renew the argument with regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an area and authorizes the President to set it aside under the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain those lands.\n Well, given the absence of a summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.\n No. You would not have   we   we believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not think that he foreclosed it. But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's important and worthwhile. We think that this case falls squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in particular we relied on it primarily because it provides an actual textual basis for showing that the   the United States retain those lands. We do not need to go further and show purpose, although we certainly can. We relied on the Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear example of why retention is   is required in this case. The master agreed with us. He analyzed the Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the   the proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent retention clause. There's no other way to understand the Arctic Coast decision except on that basis. And we think that's the right interpretation, and we think if we   if you focus on what the Court said on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear. The statement that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test is an afterthought at the end of the opinion. It's a statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce the conclusion it's already reached. It doesn't provide a basis for   for departing from that. And in fact, as I hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't make any sense, that they're simply   all of those lands that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall within the main clause. The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple purposes. It's   the two wildlife refuges that they point to both the record shows were used for multiple purposes. They were not used solely for conservation purposes. And in addition, they were   to the extent that those refuges adverted to any lands at all   any statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not   not the 1943 statute. Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has no answer for. One   one of those refuges, in particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other areas. It clearly is being used for those purposes. We think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did intend to retain these lands. That was the point that   that this proviso, as Secretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he stated in   the excerpt appears in page   on page 47, note 37 of our brief. He stated that these reservations   the land and water would be reserved. He clearly was aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to reserve both land and water. Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back and look at the big picture here. The United States' position overall results in a very sensible division of submerged lands in this case. We have not contested Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest. Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal Government interests are paramount. First of all, with regard to drawing international   developing international principles to establish baselines, which creates these bays and   and pockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our foreign policy requires. Secondly, where the United States has clearly reserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National Park. This park was set aside for the benefit of the entire Nation. We think that the Court should adopt the master's report in full. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Franklin, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n Thank you, Your Honor. To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact, advocating the principles of that case. It is not sufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation that might include submerged lands. Congress has to take some action to explicitly ratify that. That was what happened in the Idaho case, according to the Court. And the United States has identified one statute and one statute only that it asserts can   ratifies the bay, and that's section 6(e), the proviso. We think the plain language to section (e)   6(e) is dispositive in this case. We are operating here under a clear statement rule. The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended that the submerged lands   title to submerged lands be defeated. There was   the statute says such transfer shall not include. There simply was no need for Congress to have included   to have specified that such transfer, the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged lands when they were not included   or excuse me   shall not include properties that were not included in the first place. That includes Glacier Bay.\n Would   would you respond to the   to the argument that the Alaska Arctic Coast case decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?\n Well, my   my first response is even the master, who ruled   who   who decided against us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60 and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within the proviso. Therefore   excuse me. The main clause. Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held that lands that did not fall within the main clause were included by the proviso. It is important, though, to   to note this, that even if the statute is ambiguous   and we think that it is not   Alaska still prevails here because a   there is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.\n But the   the argument is that it is clear because the reservation without the reservation of the waters would be crazy.\n Well, it  \n Why isn't   I mean, what's   what's the answer?\n We dispute that for the following reason, Your Honor, that   that the   the point of the monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the glaciers as they recede on dry land. Title to the submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose. But I think their sky-is-falling argument really falls apart here. All that the counsel can point to is the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom. There is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would   would prevent scientists who want to study this   these lands from doing that. We let scientists onto all of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they have a good reason for doing it. We hope to work cooperatively with the Federal Government on this. The   the idea that Alaska is somehow going to be less receptive to scientific research here I think demeans our Federal structure. We have a Federal structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands is given to the States because they are viewed as the ones principally affected by the activities that go on there. We are not planning on   on preventing scientists from scuba diving down there. By the way, they did not at the time of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because there   there really wasn't any scuba diving going on. But to   to move on   I see my time is up.\n Thank you, Mr. Franklin. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court: Kansas would like to address three issues today. 50 years of success of the Court's river master on the Delaware River and 16 years of success of the Court's river master on the Pecos River demonstrate the wisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate circumstances on a river like the Arkansas River, which is the subject of this case. Secondly, the Court should affirm the neutral principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages owing at the time interest begins to run. And third, a 1-year compliance period would be consistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and would preserve an essential right of Kansas and its farmers under this   this compact that would otherwise be lost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year accounting period. With respect to this accounting period, I would note that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court has relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, which is the standard for compact compliance in this case. In the first opinion in 1995, this Court distinguished between monthly and   and seasonal use of the model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but that seasonal reliance on the model for determining useability under article IV-D of the compact was reasonable. When the case was back here in 2001, this Court reviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a yearly basis. As you can imagine, the factors that go into calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H I Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently accurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.\n Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm wrong. I   I looked at these papers a while ago. I thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate the   the relevant amounts in the 10th year.\n That is correct, Your Honor. It is a moving accumulation of 10 years of results.\n So they do use 10 years of figures to determine what the relevant year's water would be.\n That's correct, Your Honor. In other words, the   the annual determination includes the most current year for which there is data and the previous 9 years, adds all those up, nets out the pluses and minuses, and that determines whether in the year in question there is compliance with the compact.\n This will begin in 2007, as I recall. Is that  \n That is the special master's proposal, yes.\n And what I don't understand is even   even if we agree with you that it should be done annually, why   why wouldn't you propose that it be done annually using the previous 7 years' experience that we now have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can use the previous 10 years? I   I don't understand why we have to do it year by year and forego even 7 years'benefit of   of this methodology.\n Your Honor, I couldn't agree with you more in the sense that we should begin now with the accounting so that you look each year at the results of this standard, which has been approved by the Court, for compact compliance in that year only, and if   if you accumulate it  \n No. That   that's   I said just the opposite. I said I   I don't know why we should begin looking for this   at this year only using this methodology. Why shouldn't we average this methodology over the previous 7 years?\n Your Honor, averages will tend to smooth out the results and will hide the effects during dry years, which is when the farmers in Kansas, who are the beneficiaries that Kansas intended to benefit   and both parties realize that. They need this water  \n But your method   your method will over-emphasize the dry years. So either way you have a   a imperfect situation. In your case, year by year, and in a dry year, Colorado perhaps must over compensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row, then it's going to be   work out to Colorado's disadvantage.\n Your Honor, I believe the   the result is the   is the opposite. If I may explain. The model, the   the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, has been made as unbiased as possible. The one aspect in which we have identified a bias is that it favors Colorado during dry years. It tends to underestimate the depletions that would have to be replaced by Colorado.\n That's the method that you're attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't it be just the reverse?\n We don't believe that aspect of the model would be any different if we're doing it year by year. We'd simply be taking the results that are calculated each year under either approach and use those in that year so that if you have a dry year, you are   are calculating in that year whether there is compliance and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the compact, which is to provide water when the farmers need it.\n Do you   do you dispute what   what the master found here, that the methodology is more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by year?\n No, Your Honor. The longer the period of time you take, the more the accumulated results of the model will match the measured  \n The actual year-by-year results. Right?\n Yes, and I should point out that it's impossible to know what the right answer is. You can   you can measure the flows and the diversions in the river and compare that to one of the runs of this model, but it's the difference between the two runs, one representing the compact condition, which is supposed to be met, and the other representing the situation with the wells operating. And it's the difference between those two whose accuracy is in question.\n Yes, but I   I  \n And no one knows what that is.\n I understand that   that the master concluded that even as to a particular year, the model will be more accurate if you use the average from the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model to a single year, that even as to the real results for that single year, the model will be more accurate if you use a 10-year average.\n Your Honor, I don't understand it that way. If you use 10 years, you are adding to the most recent year results 9 years of pluses and minuses that's going to, in most case, mask what happened during that next previous year. You will be looking at a 10-year accumulation of ups and downs and not analyzing what happened in   in the year in question.\n Is part or all of the objectives of both the   the decree and the 10-year model to conserve subsurface reservoirs?\n Not   not directly, Your Honor. It   it does preserve that reservoir in fact because depletion of that reservoir affects the stream flows, and it's the stream flows that are compacted here and that have up to now  \n Well, then   well, then why isn't   if   if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado shouldn't get credit for the wet years in   in   on an average? You're concerned about the dry years. It seems to me that Colorado should be given some credit for the wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are   are replenished. Or am I wrong   am I wrong about that?\n I think in general, Your Honor, you are   are correct. The question about there are over deliveries by Colorado, I believe is what you're addressing, is there   is there a way to give Colorado credit for that. And there is a way. There is a   a   an account in John Martin Reservoir, which is 60 miles above the State line, for those deliveries. When they are delivered there, if there is more delivered than is actually needed in that year to achieve compact compliance, that can be retained there and, except for a small effect of evaporation, is available to offset depletions in the following year.\n I   I thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n Well, how does that comport with what you just said?\n Under those circumstances, the water that would be delivered to this offset account in John Martin Reservoir is not a credit that's accounted under the compact for that year. So it would not enter into the compact accounting for that year. It would not constitute a   a credit, but it would be available as a practical matter to be used as a credit in the next year for current depletions. So there would be no carryover in compact accounting.\n I don't   I don't understand that statement. You say it would be available to be used as a credit in a subsequent year. Do you really mean it would be used as a credit, or do you mean it would simply be there to be used?\n I think your formulation, Your Honor, is   is more correct.\n Okay.\n It would be there to be used, and it would not be a credit for accounting purposes. Yes.\n Well, if it's not a credit for accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as much the next year even though   even though you had more water the previous year.\n This is under the assumption, Your Honor, that they have already met their obligations in the current year.\n Yes.\n And it will be available as a practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent year and be accounted in that subsequent year. I would point out that this is very important for Kansas farmers that the   the water be received when it is supposed to be delivered under the compact. If water is   is not delivered, as required, in one year, it cannot be recouped in a following year, certainly not 10 years later, as would be possible under the special master  \n Well, then why are you using a 10-year model at all?\n It's not a 10  \n It seems to me what you're   what you're saying is forget the 10 years. Just do it every year.\n That's what we are saying, Your Honor. And the model is inherently a yearly model. It calculates actually results on a monthly basis, and we have used it   and the Court has relied upon it   on a yearly basis up to now.\n Why don't you do it on a monthly basis? Indeed, why don't you do it on a daily basis? I mean, the master found that this model really works if you   if you stretch it out over 10 years. You say 1 year. Why don't you do it month by month?\n Well, it   it could be done that way, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this same model in its own administration of groundwater pumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of protecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires replacement of water on a monthly basis. So it is   it is possible. But we believe with the yearly accumulation that   that we have relied upon so far in this case and that the Court has relied upon specifically for damages, that that is an appropriate accounting period for this particular purpose. And that is   that is our proposal. The proposal of Colorado is no, let's wait 10 years before   and   and accumulate it with the other 9 years before we require any replacement. I would point out that the H-I Model, the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, is the best tool available for this purpose. It was endorsed by Colorado after the Court's first opinion in this case when it   the Court approved using the model on a seasonal basis for the seasonal accounting of useability. At that time, Colorado gave up its own model in favor of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, and as you can see from the master's report, there have been several significant improvements in the model since that time. I would also point out the correspondence   the close correspondence that exists between this case and the Pecos River litigation in the 1980's. There you had a compact that like this compact did not specify any specific quantity of water in the compact itself, but indicated that there was to be no depletions beyond the depletions that were occurring at the time of the compact with a few small amendments that I could   I could mention. But the basic similarity of the compacts is that the status quo at the time of the compact was maintained. There was an inflow/outflow relationship that needed to be observed and was required to be observed by the compact. It was expressed explicitly in the Pecos River compact by a reference to an inflow/outflow method. In this case, it was expressed implicitly in article IV-D of the compact.\n The master found that the role of the river master in the Pecos case was quite different than the role of the river master you want to have appointed here. He found that the role of the river master in the Pecos cases was really ministerial.\n Your Honor, we do not agree with that.\n You don't agree with what?\n With the description of the Pecos River master as being   as having only ministerial duties, and I can explain why.\n Please do.\n Yes. if   if you refer to the appendix of our   our blue brief, on page A-22, you will see that the opening section of the Pecos River master's manual sets out the inflow/outflow relationship that is to be observed in complying with that compact. This is the form of an equation. You can see y equals and a   and a number there. In   in our case, we have the   the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, which benefits from several decades of increased sophistication in hydrologic analysis to do the same job.\n The Pecos master can simply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results that the compact requires?\n He   he is to apply the formula, Your Honor, but there's a great deal of judgment, professional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised in order to apply it. For example, you have to separate flood flows from base flows. When you look at the   at the results of a   of a gauge on a river, you can see how much water was in the river at particular times, but this has to be separated into two different kinds of flows that are treated differently under this compact.\n Well, one of the reasons I'm curious is that I believe the Pecos master is an engineer. He's not a lawyer.\n That's correct.\n He's also the cheapest master we've ever had. (Laughter.)\n But it seems to me that the master you want appointed has got to be a lawyer and make legal decisions.\n Your Honor, I don't believe so. I think our master would be just as cheap. (Laughter.)\n What's the difference  \n No. The question was what about the  \n What   what relation do you or   yes   working relation do you anticipate, if   if the river master is appointed, between the river master and the commission? Does he go first to the commission and try to get agreement or  \n Your Honor, no, he would not formally interact with the commission, just as the Pecos River master does not formally interact with the Pecos River commission.\n Well, what can   what can the river master do that the   that the commission or authority can't do? I   is the difference between the two of them   call it a jurisdictional difference   nil, but there is process difference in the sense that the river master could say do this or don't do that, whereas your   your fear is that the authority is simply going to be deadlocked because everything has to be done unanimously? Is it a process difference?\n It is a process difference, Your Honor. The  \n But for that, you wouldn't be asking for a river master then.\n Well, if there were an authoritative way, such as a river master, by which the annual recurring exercise of judgment could be accomplished, we would not need the river master. But I don't  \n But aren't you bypassing what Congress set up? You have this interstate compact and this commission, which you're saying, well, it's ineffective because it has to   there are three from each State and it has to do everything unanimously. But what about the commission's authority to call in an   an arbitrator when they are deadlocked?\n That decision also requires unanimity, Your Honor, and in the one case I'm aware of, Kansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by Colorado. It's   but it's   it takes unanimity to do anything under that compact administration, including the arbitration option.\n But you're saying Congress  \n Mr. Draper, could I ask you what is a matter of procedure? What is your understanding of   of how one would go about challenging the river master's decision if one disagreed with it? Do you go to the special master? Do you come direct to this Court?\n Your Honor, we have suggested that it be set up just as you have set up the Pecos River master. In other words, if there were an objection to the determination, the yearly determination, of the river master, it would be reviewable by this Court.\n Directly.\n Directly.\n And the special master would be out. The special master would be out of the picture, as you describe it. You   the special master would be finished. The river master would take over. Has there ever been   has this Court ever appointed a river master when the special master did not recommend it? And as I understand both Delaware and the Pecos River case, the special master recommended the appointment of a river master.\n Your Honor, I believe in both of those cases, the   the special master was recommending the appointment of a river master, but I would point out that in setting out the criteria for appointing a river master, the Court did not refer to that factor as   as being part of the consideration.\n As I understand the system you propose, the river master's decision would be appealable to us, and we would review it de novo. Is that right?\n We're suggesting the same scope of review as on the Pecos, which is clearly erroneous. This, however, is something that the Court could decide to do differently than the Pecos, but the clearly erroneous standard comports with the   the way master recommendations are handled in the district court under rule 53.\n I'm very loathe to deprive either of the States of their   their right to have this Court decide matters between them.\n Your Honor, this would not deprive either State of that right. And in fact  \n Well, it would if they can only come here and   and overturn the river master if he's clearly erroneous. That's a   that's a very high standard.\n Well, there   as I say, the Court   the Court may set the review threshold as it sees fit.\n I   I had thought that your proposal was de novo review. This is   this is new to me, that   that you want it clearly erroneous.\n Your Honor, I would   I would say that we have   we have mentioned the clearly erroneous review standard because it was in the Pecos framework. It is not essential to our proposal. A de novo review would be perfectly fine with the State of Kansas.\n Suppose the commission decided to appoint an arbitrator. Would the special   pardon me. Would the river master then proceed independently and we'd have two different recommendations?\n As under the Pecos, Your Honor, if the   if the compact administration, as it's called in the   in the Arkansas Basin, is able to come to a resolution of an issue, then that would   that would take care of that issue. It would be   not be necessary to have the river master address that, and it would be an agreement of the States because it would either be an agreement because they had literally agreed before the   or in the form of the Arkansas River Compact Administration or that they had agreed to binding arbitration and had settled it.\n Well, then it would seem to me, procedurally at least, the river master would have if not the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer things first to the commission.\n Your Honor, the referral of matters to the commission is why we're here in the first place. It cannot act without unanimity. The State of Colorado, the State in possession of this resource, can veto each and every action of the compact administration.\n That was the deal.\n Your   yes. Your State agreed to it.\n That was the deal they came to. Why should we kick it over? They came to that arrangement, and it was approved by Congress, and now you come back and tell us, oh, this is too cumbersome. You should   you should appoint this river master to do an end run around it. I   I   it doesn't seem to me to be fair.\n Your Honor, I don't believe that this is an end run any more than the enforcement of the compact is an end run around the administrative body that is set up in many of these compacts. Those are keep-in-touch type bodies. If they can agree on things, they are very useful, and the Arkansas River Compact Administration has been useful in areas where there can be agreement.\n No, but you   you agree that this is the   the authority here is more than a keep-in-touch group. Your problem with it is   is not that you need something more than keep in touch, but that when you ask them to do something more than keep in touch, the other State has a veto. And   and that simply gets you to Justice Scalia's objection. That's the deal you made.\n That is the   that is the nub of our argument against reliance on the Arkansas River Compact Administration, that you can't look at it to settle differences about the implementation of this Court's decree.\n What did the special  \n That is a  \n What did the special master mean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote problem, but he said, but the climate may be changing? The compact administration under the chairmanship of the United States representative may again be seen as the best way to administer their compact and settle issues. What was he talking about?\n Your Honor, I think he was talking about the hope that he has that the States could work more cooperatively now, despite the fact that it was on this river between these two States that this Court was first asked to resolve interstate river disputes between States in 1901, and we are here today still in dispute over this river.\n So there was nothing tangible behind his  \n Nothing tangible, Your Honor. We   perhaps he was thinking of the settlement that we have achieved on the Republican River. That case started, was accepted by this Court. After rulings by this Court, it became possible to settle that case. It has now been settled. And the States involved in that litigation were Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. It was possible in that   in that context. It has proven impossible in this context. And we can expect disputes to go on, as they have over the last century, if we do not have an impartial expert authority to resolve disputes between States that are going to come up every year. Every year there are questions. How do you take the data this year and put it into the H-I Model? While many of those issues have been settled, because different forms of replacement and other different circumstances arise, you have those every year. And if you follow the lead that the Pecos River cases of this Court give us, there is also the possibility to address the improvement of the tool for implementing the agreement of the States, and that is improving the Hydrologic-Institutional Model on occasion, as we have seen the master do over the course of this litigation. That is allowed under the Pecos River Decree, and we submit that it should be allowed under this decree as well. And that is when the master would be exercising the most judgment in our opinion. I would conclude by saying that a   a river master is needed on the Arkansas to deal impartially and expertly with annual questions that must be resolved to implement the H-I Model, and that a 1-year compliance period will implement the intentions of the drafters of the compact and the needs of Kansas farmers and is consistent with the yearly reliance that this Court has already placed on the H-I Model. I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if there are no further questions.\n Very well, Mr. Draper. Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I will begin by discussing the river master since that's where Mr. Draper left off. I want to make it clear, first of all, that I disagree with the assertion that the Pecos River Compact and the Arkansas River Compact are similar in the way they operate. The Pecos River Compact did, in fact, specifically state that it was   it intended to hold the level of   of depletion of the system by man's development to the 1947 condition. The Arkansas River Compact, to the contrary, begins the   the limitation clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas Basin, provided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use for the uses. So the   the Arkansas compact contemplated that there would be a   a more flexible effort at using the water of the river by water users in both States, protecting the existing uses in both States from that future development. Now, this   this Court has appointed a river master in two circumstances. In both circumstances, as pointed out by Justice Ginsburg, the   the special master recommended that because of the specific circumstances of the case, that in fact a river master was appropriate. That was on the Delaware River and the Pecos River. In all other cases that deal with this issue where requests have been made by   by States without river   without a special master's recommendation, the Court has declined to appoint a river master. There's a very good reason, I think, behind that. Colorado alone is the party denying interstate compacts in two equitable apportionment decrees. If every time a State is dissatisfied with its neighbor, is dissatisfied with how a compact operates, it is able to come to this Court and say, please appoint a river master, we're just having trouble with our neighbor, you'll become the water management   the super water management agency for the country. You have river masters if you   it's totally up to   to your discretion. But if you were to follow this line of thinking, you end up supervising water distribution across the west and part of the east.\n Well, the disputes are going to come up here eventually anyway if the States are intransigent. Ultimately it will be a dispute about the application of the compact and it will come back here anyway, won't it?\n Justice Scalia, that is absolutely correct, but the difference is where compacts have mechanisms within them that are designed to work out these differences, I think it is in the Court's interest   and Colorado's position is and the special master's position was it was in the Court's interest   to refer these matters back to those compact administrations. You  \n Counsel, do you think it's any more likely today than in the past that the two States will be able to work out their continued disagreements?\n Justice O'Connor, I agree completely with the special master. The State of Colorado has proposed, as referred to in his ruling, that binding arbitration be used and has committed itself to participate in that. To the extent there   there have been past conflicts, Colorado has said let's get them behind us. Let's return to the compact, congressionally sanctioned method for resolving our differences, and let's proceed down the road. We will  \n But   but Colorado still has the veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will be appointed. Is that right?\n That is   under the compact, that's correct.\n Yes, yes.\n And so   but   but Colorado has made a   a very clear commitment to the special master and does so to this Court that if arbitration is proposed, Colorado would participate. We do not as a State find it very acceptable to spend the time, money, and effort to litigate these issues. After all, we have farmers. Kansas has farmers. We need to get back to getting the water equitably resolved through the compact mechanism. That is our proposal. It was  \n So is it right then that   let's imagine the special river master's name is Mr. Smith, and unlike me, he knows about this stuff. And he then   you   Kansas wants Mr. Smith to decide a certain number of issues. Call them issues on page 1, whatever they are. And as far as you're concerned, your client would say I'm happy to have Mr. Smith. Just don't call him a river master. Call him an arbitrator. So you're saying that when Kansas says they would do it except there's a problem of getting unanimity, you say the only problem is that you won't agree.\n At the present time, that's the posture  \n Now, they're the obstacle to unanimity. So the keys are in their own pocket if they want Mr. Smith. That's your view.\n Our view is if they want to arbitrate pursuant to the compact, the keys are in their   in their pocket. We do not believe  \n So the problem can't be one of unanimity because your side agrees. I mean, you heard what he said. So I'm   I'm trying to see  \n Our side agrees, Your   Justice Breyer, with   with the concept that this matter should be returned to the compact administration to resolve the differences in that forum.\n And   and in that forum, you will agree to binding arbitration.\n In that forum, we will agree to binding arbitration.\n Binding arbitration will   will mercifully keep this stuff off of our desk, won't it?\n Yes, it will. (Laughter.)\n I want   I want to make it very clear to the Court that the State of Colorado, different than the situation in the Pecos River, acted very aggressively to ensure that it promptly came into compliance with the   with the determination that in fact depletions were occurring, impermissible depletions were occurring to the Arkansas River. Within 2 years, the State of Colorado's legislature had passed the appropriate legislation. The State engineer had passed rules and regulations, implemented them, and enforced them. The State had authorized millions of dollars in loans for the acquisition of replacement water, and   and the State of Colorado   your   your ruling was in 1995. By 1997, it appears that the State of Colorado was in compliance with the compact. That is a significant and very difficult effort on the part of the legislature, the Governor, the attorney general, and the State engineer. We do not believe that this is anything like the Pecos River. Your master in this case has not said to you these parties are   are torn, will not get together, and you need to have a master, a river master, appointed. In this instance, the State of Colorado took the exact opposite approach. They did everything they could to reduce the pumping of the wells sufficiently to allow Colorado to meet the terms of the compact, and that is an important fact you need to glean from the special master's report. Now, the   the other   the only other point I want to make on this is that the   the   it's   it's very important, in deciding whether or not a river master is the appropriate course of action to determine   and I   I mentioned this earlier   whether or not the Court wants to be in a supervisory position. I happen to agree that the States are entitled to seek redress of their concerns before this Court, and as you said in   in Oklahoma v. New Mexico, you have a serious obligation to adjudicate disputes between the States where there are actual and existing controversies. And   and the fact that you would have a river master would not eliminate the potential for those controversies. In our view, the only way that you can get this matter off of your plate and into the position that Congress recognized and   and directed is to follow the special master's recommendation number 12. I'd now like to turn, if I may, to the issue of the accuracy of the model.\n May I ask you a question, because you may not bother to talk about it otherwise, about punitive damages? Your opponent didn't seem to think it very important, but I have this question. Is it your view that the other State waived its claim to the punitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it today or by submitting the different set of figures at the time the   the issue was before the master the last time around?\n Justice Stevens, in response to your question, we believe that in fact the issue of prejudgment interest, or punitive damages, is law of the case in this matter. The special master set out a formula by which he proposed how the damages should be calculated. Kansas argued for actual value of money, a rather rigid theory of compensation, and the special master chose in fact a balancing of the equities approach. He suggested that the appropriate means to calculate those   that prejudgment interest on the   the nominal damages  \n Did he   did he make that suggestion or did the other   did Kansas make that suggestion?\n The special master ruled on how he believed the damages should be calculated.\n In this time around or in the preceding  \n In the preceding time around. And what he said was that the damages from 1950 to 1968 should be   should   should receive a inflationary increase to reflect the inflationary tendencies, but that they should not be dealt with under prejudgment interest. In other words, it shouldn't be compounded through prejudgment interest. Only the damages from 1969 forward should be compounded using prejudgment interest. Kansas did not except to that methodology. Kansas excepted to the fact that he didn't give them prejudgment interest on the damages from 1950 forward. In the opinion that you authored for the Court, you accepted the master's methodology, and you did one thing and only one.\n Well, the master's methodology really wasn't at issue.\n The master's  \n The only issue before us, as I remember it, was the date from which the prejudgment interest would run.\n That's  \n That's   that's all that was argued. And it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed sum rather than an   a changing amount as years went by, that clearly we would have   the interest would have run on the existing liability. But it's an unusual case because the damages are changing as time goes by.\n It is and I agree with you, Justice Stevens. It is an unusual case. But the   the critical element here is that the master was looking for an equitable way to arrive at a damage sum.\n Well, except that, as I read his report, he was simply interpreting our opinion, best he could, on the second go-round.\n This   this go-round?\n Yes.\n That's correct, Justice Kennedy.\n And   and I think that's what's before us here. It   it seems to me that your best argument for no interest post '85 on the pre-'85 damages is to say, well, it's uncertain, it's hard to compute, but that doesn't quite work because this Court   and of course, the special master   allowed damages   the interest on post-'85 damages even though those are equally difficult to compute.\n It isn't the   if I may, Justice Kennedy, it isn't the  \n So I'm   I'm saying it seems to me that's your best argument, but there's a flaw in there.\n38 million. By moving the year forward from 1969 to 1985, you automatically then reduce, by some degree, the amount of that damage calculation.\n No, but did we   your   your view is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that past damage.\n Prejudgment  \n Pre-1985.\n The   the special master's methodology, Justice Stevens, was that the damages in his third report from 1950 to 1968 should not, under a balancing of the equities, bear prejudgment interest at any point in time. They should only be advanced for inflation, which was a proposal Colorado made because Colorado believed that it   the changing a 1950 damage to a   to a 2002, or at that time a 1994, dollar value was only fair and reasonable. We opposed the concept of giving prejudgment interest because it would   it would be   it's as if   if this were a commercial context, we would have been able to identify that there was a damage going on and the theory in your prejudgment cases is we could have put the money in the bank  \n But we rejected that as to post-'85 damages.\n You agreed that prejudgment interest, Justice Kennedy, should be applied to post-'85 damages, not to pre-'85 damages.\n Well, but our opinion didn't say it was just post-'85 damages. Our   our opinion didn't   didn't answer the question, and   and the reason, of course, is we didn't actually think about it because nobody even   nobody argued it at that time.\n Our view was that   that   our view is, Justice Stevens, that an exception needed to be taken if the master's methodology was under challenge.\n So in a way you really are arguing waiver I think.\n We are arguing law of the case. Yes, we are.\n Which is consistent with his failure to argue it today.\n That's   that is our position, Your Honor. I would like to, if   if I may, move off of prejudgment interest. I would like to talk, while I still have a few minutes, a little bit about this model and the 10-year average.\n Can you give   I'm   I'm not sure I understand the dispute. Can you give me in   in   without using up all of your time, a   basically a simple example to illustrate the difference between the two contending methodological positions?\n Yes, I can, Justice Souter. Under the   the master's formulation, which is agreed to by Colorado, the damages which occur in each year, 1950 through 1984, are   are computed at   in   as nominal damages in the year in which they occur. They are then expanded by the   by an inflationary formula which allows the dollar in 1950 to be calculated in a 2002 dollar. In 1985 and to the present, any damages that occur are advanced both for inflation, but then they are also awarded a prejudgment interest, which is compounded. In other words, if inflation is 2 or 3 percent through the period on a long-term average, but   but investments are at 6 or 7 percent  \n I got you.\n20-some million in the proposition, which we don't believe is what the Court intended. Let me   let me turn very quickly to the model, if I may. The   the issue here is not Colorado's obligation to deliver water to   to the river system. Colorado has both senior surface water rights and the State of Kansas that it has obligations to protect. Remember, the compact envisions that this subsequent development can't injure water users in either Kansas or Colorado. As a result, Colorado must ensure that on a monthly basis, water is placed into the river so depletions are   are compensated for in the system as they occur. The problem here is not that process. The problem here is a model that is inaccurate. Beginning in your first report, you quoted with favor the special master's comments about this model in dealing with the winter water storage program, which was an issue which you agreed should be dismissed several years ago. You indicated that depletions shown were well within the range of error and it could not be told if it was an impact or an error that the model was describing.\n Counsel, your time is running short. This is very important. I think you misunderstood Justice Souter's question. He asked you to give us an example of the Kansas versus Colorado approach as to the 10-year model. You answered him about the interest. Could you  \n I'm so sorry.\n   could you tell us really  \n Yes.\n Give us an example of the difference between the two.\n Yes. The difference between the two is this. We believe that the model over a long period of time, as it's developer, Mr. Durbin, said, is reasonably accurate. We   we agree with that, and we are willing to use it like that. But that means you have to use   look at it over extended periods of time. Our view is that you simply look at the model, which is predicting over-deliveries and under-deliveries, predicting them. They don't have any relationship to what Colorado is really putting into the system. They are predictions. And in some years where you   where you look back and you know from the gauges the model is over-predicting a significant amount, you   you want to be   and you know in a subsequent year it's going to under-predict, you want to allow that to smooth out so that you are, in fact, getting close to what's really going on. It is not an effort to carry dry-year depletions into wet years or vice versa. It is, in fact, an effort to allow the model's inherent inaccuracies to play out so that you get a more accurate result in each 10th year.\n Why doesn't   why isn't the result that you   of   of your position that you would get a more accurate set of predictions if all you were making was a 10-year calculation, but you will not get a more accurate set of predictions with respect to any one year? And in fact, it is with respect to any one year that's important under the compact. In other words, they   they plan every year, not every 10 years. So why does a 10-year accuracy help you in solving the practical problem you have on a year-to-year basis?\n As proposed by the special master, the model is not used every 10 year   or every 10th year. It's used every year. If you're looking at  \n I know. But it's used on the basis of 10-year figures which will not be accurate particularly with respect to any given year even though they would be   they would be accurate if you were only interested in a calculation every 10 years.\n You are making  \n Does it   can   can you   can you get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis is what I'm saying.\n You get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis. A   a better prediction if you're looking at the model over 10 years versus looking at the model just running it in a given year. Colorado does not want to be in a position, Justice Souter, where we are accused of violating the compact because there is an inaccuracy in the tool that is being used.\n Thank you  \n It  \n Thank you, Mr. Robbins.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's the position of the United States that   that we agree with Colorado and with the special master that a river master should not be appointed in this case. The compact between the States of Kansas and Colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for implementing the obligations in that compact, which has to do with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount of water to Kansas. The commission is also charged with investigating violations of the compact, and the compact includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to binding arbitration if the   the States agree to that. The   the commission also certainly could use other dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the authority to do if it wanted to. The States have agreed to that. Congress has enacted it into law, and this Court should permit the parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that might arise in the future rather than putting a river master in place under the authority of this Court. Now, the Court has   itself has frequently stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort is preferable to litigation. As the special master pointed out, in the two river basins just north of the Arkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River, the parties recently, after having a dispute, including these very same two States in one of them, have come to a consensual resolution of the dispute that they had. And I think that does show, as the special master pointed out, that these   the States can   in fact, the disputes in those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect of well pumping, among other things. As the special master pointed out, I think that shows that the States can use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and this Court ought to continue its often-stated preference for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to problems of this sort. If the Court were to appoint a river master in this case, then I think the question would arise in any future case in which you have two States that have conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity, as what happened with river compacts, equitable apportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an inherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree or judgment. And I think rather than   that   that would be directly contrary to the Court's other statement in the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and that it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions, but also that the Court does not favor appointing agents or functionaries to carry out its decrees.\n So I guess we made a mistake with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other one? Delaware?\n Yes. The Pecos River   I mean, there were a couple of differences, in addition to the ones that Mr. Robbins pointed out. One difference is that not only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos River case   neither party objected to the appointment of a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of clothing the master with authority to make determinations that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous standard. In this case, there is a party that objects to it. And I would   I think there's another difference that's important that the Court ought to keep in mind. At the time the Pecos River master was appointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which the Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide for this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and the Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the   it provided that the river master in that case would be reviewed under that standard. As of 2003, rule 53   it's now rule 53(g)   provides that masters appointed by district courts said their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo standard unless the parties agree otherwise. Therefore, at the present time   and again, following the Court's rule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be guides   and I think they are a useful guide   the appropriate course here, if the Court were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one whose findings will be reviewable de novo. But that itself raises problems because if the findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's really just a continuation of the current litigation and it doesn't really advance things any. The parties will submit the evidence to the river master. He'll make his determinations, and then they'll come to the Court. That's really more what the special master does at the current time. So I think that under all of those circumstances, both the Court's preference for a consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the Court's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to decide cases of this sort and it can't   it's not the obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission that Congress has put into place specifically to deal with this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute resolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a river master in this case. As far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's the position of the United States also that the special master and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest should not be awarded. I think it's a familiar principle in   to this Court in litigation that if a party   when the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all of its objections if it wants the Court to hear them. In this case, the special master came up with a recommendation in his third report about how to   what should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the early years   the   the amount of the damages in those early years would never be subject to prejudgment interest. Now, Kansas objected to that and said we should move the year back to 1950. We should get prejudgment interest on everything back to year one. But they never made the objection that if you   if the Court disagrees with that, which it did, that the method that the master had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969 was incorrect. That was the time that Kansas should have brought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.\n So you're arguing they've waived the   your argument is they waived the objection basically.\n Yes. I think  \n I don't think you used the word waiver in your brief, and I don't think that Colorado did either. But I guess that's the essence of your argument.\n I   I actually think it's a combination of two things. On the one hand, what the Court actually said in its opinion was that the special master had awarded damages only insofar as necessary to satisfy the demands of equity, something to that effect.\n Would you not agree that if it was a one-shot injury, not an ongoing injury, that the normal reading would be the injury   the interest should run on the laws?\n I think in the normal contract case that doesn't have the kinds of equities that this case had, that is the current rule, that prejudgment interest would run. But this kind of case involves damages that go back 50-odd years. It could have been  \n And it involves continuing, ongoing  \n And they're   they're ongoing that are different in amount in every year, that it's not merely that Colorado was violating the compact as of 1950, although it probably didn't know it at that time, but that Kansas didn't bring a suit until 1985 and the fact, I think, that Colorado has always agreed to pay   to adjust the damages for inflation. So, in essence, Kansas is getting a portion of what the prejudgment interest would normally cover for those early years. I think if all that's put together, I think the Court's conclusion that the master's conclusion was just the amount that equity dictates was correct, and that if Kansas didn't like that, it should  \n Mr. Feldman, the Government takes no position on this 1-year versus 10-year computation?\n No, the Government doesn't have a position on that.\n Too hard for you? (Laughter.)\n That issue involves the particularities of this case and the Government doesn't really have a particular interest in how that gets resolved. If there's no further questions, that concludes the argument.\n Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Draper, you have 2 minutes remaining.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to state that we do not believe that we waived our position on the interest calculation as was just suggested in the   in the last colloquy. The reason that we didn't do that is because we filed an exception last time against every respect in which the special master was not recommending full interest. And it turned out that the Court chose the   the test that we now have, which is a relatively easy test to apply. It has certain incentives that grow out of it that make sense. And we believe that we sufficiently excepted to that. If look at our brief from that exception, the one in   in support of our exceptions, in particular   particularly to page 25, footnote 8, we specifically addressed the issue that the   the master was not allowing any interest in that 1950 through 1968 period.\n You're talking about the brief in the earlier case.\n In the earlier case, to the third report of the special master. I would   also, on the other points that were raised, you need to be  \n This is a lot of money involved, and   and you certainly didn't argue it here. I don't recall that point being argued. And with all that money being involved, I would have thought it would have been argued.\n Well, we were   we were arguing the larger issues on interest, but we were asking that interest not be denied to us during that '50 through 1968 period. That was very clear from our briefs, and we specifically singled out that part of it in that footnote. So I don't believe it's appropriate that   to conclude that we have waived that argument. And I would point out also that the only reason that it was done that way   and the calculations of the parties did   did in connection with that review   is because the special master required it. There is no other reason that we did it. We did not volunteer to do it that way. We did not like doing it that way. The master said that's the way it's going to be in my recommendation. How much would that amount to? We did not agree in any way to that part of the calculation. I would also point out that with respect to the amounts involved, that you need to be careful. The amounts cited by Mr. Robbins are not from the same year.\n Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Draper.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to turn first to the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the term \"willfully\" and its determination that the case had to be remanded for further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore Petitioners' communications with their counsel. We ask this Court to find that there is no necessity for any such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege because summary judgment should have been affirmed in this case. Petitioners and their counsel, if you think about what communications you might find, they could not have known anything more about these statutory issues of first impression than the district court did. It's questions of law. And if the district court's opinion does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the, of the FCRA. The first   the Ninth Circuit nevertheless reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to go ahead and look at privileged communications if the Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully. And the first is that they read willfully in this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several cases where this Court has read the term willfully in civil statutes to mean recklessly. But this Court has said repeatedly that the word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used to determine whether it means with knowledge that your conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations are sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike the other three that were at issue, Congress has used the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean, as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that their conduct violates the Act.\n Well, it's also used in the phrase \"knowing and willfully.\" That appears in several other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.\n Well, it actually says \"willfully and knowingly  \"\n In one formulation or another, but it combines the two words, knowing and willful.\n Well, this Court, though, has held that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is used together, it's been discussed in a number of cases including Dixon recently, that it means   willfully means knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts. And that would make perfect sense in this setting, and so the term willfully when, again, used  \n You mean willfully alone?\n It  \n Where   where it   where it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, that does not mean knowing the facts? If you mistake the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?\n Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and the Court held that it meant that you knew that your conduct violated the law. And that seems to be the most reasonable reading here because if you look, there are also sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing conduct, and that would require the conclusion that Congress used willfully in this section to mean a   a less   a more   a less culpable mens rea than knowingly. And that's  \n So that if you're the CEO of your company, and a lawyer   Federal counsel comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we need to make an important decision about whether we are complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I don't want to know about it. That would not be willfully violating the statute?\n Well, under   some cases have suggested that there could be a willful blindness instruction that would govern whether you define that as knowing or not. Certainly  \n So it doesn't have to be actual knowledge?\n I think that the best reading of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is, that is everything but, you know, that really is  \n How about reckless disregard?\n Well, conscious disregard is a recklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit correctly determined that this should be interpreted as a recklessness standard, this Court has defined recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious disregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of   of harm or in this case illegality. And in these circumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk of illegality because what the district court found is that the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute were actually not only reasonable, but correct, and having  \n Since the term knowingly or knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer from that that willfully in that provision also means something different?\n I think the way it's used, it says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a permissible purpose. Permissible purpose, that may not be knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that your purpose wasn't permissible. And even if they were using it  \n I thought the statute says what the permissible purposes are.\n It does, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what the statute said. Because for instance, users are told what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit report from, from a credit agency. But more importantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the term knowingly there can also be explained. If you look at Section 1681h, it actually provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions that are carved out in 1681n. And so I think it was to make clear, I think it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a willful intent to injure. So even if they meant it to be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just surplusage. It was to clarify that they didn't have to have a willful intent to violate.\n Would you say it's all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless, which is basically what you   taking it here, you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n If you come across anything that would use that, I mean \"reckless\" itself is unclear. The model penal code tried to clarify it based on this Court's opinions primarily.\n But I think you can look to the way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs. Brennan as well, though, as well as  \n What's the difference?\n The difference is just, there is two forms of recklessness. One which says that if the risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have known, you could be   you could be liable. But that the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used here in this setting, where there is the potential for very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to   Farmer versus Brennan calls it \"criminal,\" the criminal recklessness standard. And that means that not only do you have to have an objectively high risk of illegality, but you must be actually conscious of that risk. But in this case, you don't even need to get to the issue of consciousness.\n Well, you said there is no way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here. I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers. They know there's risk that this is unlawful.\n The question is  \n But consciousness, I mean, maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't know that that would help you.\n I think the issue of conscious   the risk, though, it has to be a high risk. And if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or even if it is an interpretation of the statute that is fairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of success, then how can you say that is a high risk of illegality, so high that we should say that Congress wanted to sanction you for taking that position? And for saying that, you know, you shouldn't be permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was a fair ground for believing that it was lawful. And here what the Ninth Circuit did  \n Suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful. Lawyers are in disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it. Is that a willful violation?\n I don't, I don't think so, Your Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for    \n But I think I'm violating.\n I don't   yes. But you couldn't know you were violating it, and because if it really is a fair ground for litigation  \n I'm a better lawyer than my advisors. (Laughter.)\n Your Honor, I think if it's an area where the law is truly unsettled. And here an issue of first impression, a lawyer's assessment that you may lose is inherently predictive. These are not true or false answers when there is almost nothing to go on. And so in that area, it's much like what this Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a case involving a willful violation of, or interference with rights secured by   by Federal law. And what the Court says, well, it's not just any bad purpose that Congress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy announced rules of law. They have to be, there has to be sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a high risk of illegality that you could disregard.\n Would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all?\n Only  \n Or would you just look to the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation, it was a close question; it's okay?\n I don't think you would look at the intent until you found that there   there was no reasonable ground or at least no, no   no fair ground for debate about the question. And at that point, Your Honor, if there was an objectively high risk of illegality, then you do have to ask, what were they consciously aware of; what did they do?\n I must say that   that is not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating the law.\n Well, I think in Screws  \n You're changing it to mean willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.\n I don't think so.\n I mean, if I know that what I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating the law.\n Your Honor, Screws says you can't know the unknowable. And if the law, if it's really, truly an issue of first impression, you may think you're violating the law, but you   you can't know the unknowable. And that's why this setting is so important, because you can't, you know, put   impose sanctions. Here we're talking about the potential for an industry facing billions of dollars without any actual harm to   to individuals. And that  \n Is it really billions? How many of these have been certified as class actions?\n I believe that there are two certified class actions. But many   there are many cases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your Honor. Certainly if the classes are certified, and  \n Would you, would you, as representative of the insurers, would you have a sound objection to class action certification in these cases?\n Your Honor, I'm sure there would be some bases to resist. But classes have been certified, so I  \n And gone to, gone to judgment?\n I do not believe any have gone to judgment, but I don't, I don't   I think that the point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every consumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they may have gotten a better price if they had even better credit, across the country, if you interpret the statute that way, and then you can say you can get this thousand dollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply that by the number of consumers, then you certainly have the potential for very, very substantial liability.\n It's a question how many will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation costs.\n Well, given that these are proceeding as class actions, the answer is there is plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys to bring these class actions, and they have been brought, and this is a class action. There are two class actions.\n They haven't   neither has been certified, has it?\n No, it has not. They are putative class actions, Your Honor. But I, but I think that whether it's a class action or not, we have to look at what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive damages based on a willful violation in a technical area where there is no potential for harm? And certainly  \n I have just two, two questions on, on willful and then   because you may want to talk about the other issue in the case. First, you began by saying that here a district judge has come to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be reckless. Do you have any authority, where we   for that proposition, where we have said that?\n Well  \n We find all the time that a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so forth   and disregard what I just said. That's my first question. And the second is willfully, as Screws itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.\n Except Screws, Your Honor, actually says that it was adopting a criminal recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a reckless standard. And that is the same standard that has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully in the punitive damages context. So I think it's exactly the same standard in that Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't just be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad purpose to violate clearly defined rules. And this Court has said in various contexts in the, in the qualified immunity area that picking the losing side does not mean that your conduct was objectively, you know, wrongful. And that's really   I think that there is great significance to the district court's ruling. I'm not saying that in every case, it would absolutely be dispositive. I think you have to look at what was the, you know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning of the district court. But what the Ninth Circuit did is that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on creative but unlikely answers to issues of first impression. Well, if an administration official goes to a lawyer in the administration and asks about a course of conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue of first impression, there is probably a 40 percent chance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed on that basis?\n Well, just because an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's a high degree of uncertainty. The statute may be clearly addressed to that issue. It hasn't come up before.\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n First impression.\n It certainly   this Court has made clear that if the language of the statute is very plain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be adequate warning. But certainly this statute doesn't satisfy that standard. Congress didn't provide the benchmarks that you have to use for comparison to determine whether there has been an increase in a charge or whether there has been an adverse action based on the consumer report. You need benchmarks to answer those questions, and there aren't any regulations and there were no cases. If I could save the balance of my time for rebuttal.\n Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Millett.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that willfulness in the civil context, as is used here, includes a reckless disregard component or a recklessness component. That is what this Court has held in a number of cases that have similar uses of willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have held. Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the three that have been most discussed in the case, in the papers here. But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here was in the application of that standard. And in particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it concluded that a creative but unlikely position constitutes recklessness, it erred. Recklessness speaks an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care. It requires that the defendant act in the face of or fail to act  \n It is a subjective standard or an objective standard?\n It has both in this context. It is, I think, first and foremost, an objective component, because there is   this is a civil case. It's not purely subjective. And that objective component is very important because that is what makes the act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk. There has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.\n So if the potential liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to be even more careful because there is liability so great. So is it the greater the liability   the greater chance of recklessness, the greater the potential liability?\n No, to the extent you're talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's true. I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury that could result, can   we'll tolerate less risk. If the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to somebody, we'll   the law will tolerate a lesser degree of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or maybe even a dollar injury. And it's not set. It's a variable calculation. So in that sense, it is. I don't think that when we talk about a high and objective risk in this context, we are talking about the dollars that a, that a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers. What we are talking about here   and this is a very unusual statute the way it's written   the liability itself, not just the damages, but the liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from law. You have to   there is no recovery here like there is in almost   or commonly in Federal statutes for just a violation. That isn't it. You have to show either a willful violation or a negligent violation, and that requires a determination not only that the defendants violated the law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how many standard deviations from correct their position was and that is an objective determination. Once an objectively high risk has been found by a court, then   then the case can shift to looking into subjective things. I think a plaintiff would be entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to infer the existence of willfulness from that. And that's often when defendants   I'm sorry.\n May I also ask, do you agree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse action?\n No, we agree with Respondents on the meaning of adverse action.\n Correct me if I'm wrong. You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your rates, that's an adverse action because they might have lowered the rates even further if they had notified me about the credit report and there were some errors in it?\n Right. It's a complicated answer, in part because that assumes that you have an existing account and you're not an initial account here. And when you have an existing account, there's a definition of adverse action for insurance provisions, but in iv there is a separate, there's another definition, and this is on, on page   sorry. Excuse me. On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under big I   I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions   talks about reviewing an existing account, and it cross-referenced another provision which talks about reviewing an account for purposes of termination. And that would include, in our view, not only completely canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. So which would govern in that particular context is a little bit harder. But it could, and here's logically why, because I think the understanding of \"increase\" that's at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation of this statute, and that is, did the content of your information in your credit report, if it had been better, could you have had a better rate or a better deal.\n Right.\n So have you been hit in the pocketbook.\n So if they lower, if they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the meaning of adverse action because they might have lowered them further if the information hadn't been erroneous?\n It could have, and here   in this sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off, but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of my gender or because of my credit report, it's an adverse action. So the fact that you're doing somewhat better doesn't mean  \n That isn't how the statute defines it.\n Excuse me?\n The statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for   in connection with underwriting.\n But it also  \n That's what it says. And then it says an increase is   and if you take an adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your increase is based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, you have to send the thing. How did you get   in your example, there was no increase. I mean, in a charge. In your salary, it's a decrease in the salary. Same thing.\n The definition again on 3A includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable change in the terms. And so it's not settled whether  \n You mean unfavorable change in terms, unfavorable change in terms.\n Exactly.\n Well, suppose you don't have, you don't have any terms because you never did it before. There's no change in terms.\n If you're a new customer   and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to existing accounts is complicated  \n You mean those words \"change in terms\" refer to rates, in other words? That's a rather odd way to refer to it. In one place, you refer to an \"increase\"; in the other place, you'd refer to it as a \"change in terms.\" That's sort of an odd way to write a statute.\n Well, you can have a change in terms that is not necessarily an increase. It could be you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when your car is in for repair for some reason. That's not an increase.\n No, no, I understand that. But what we're after is this. Everybody has a credit report, just about. You put it in and you give people the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you know that maybe there could have still been a better rate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to send notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's basically the argument. So what's your response?\n And Justice Breyer, my response is that if the content of the information in your credit report would have made you   had it been better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the content of the information, then you had an adverse action.\n Okay, so your response is just to repeat my question and say that's right?\n No. If I could continue on that, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way insurance companies work is they don't have 3 million customers and 3 million rates. They have ranges and most of them will have a top tier. They may have specialized things for employees, but putting aside a specialized category, there's a top range and they will tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15 percent of people fit in there. So they know what the best rate is. They know what the next, above average rate, the standard rate.\n How do you fit, how do you fit that within the language of the statute? Is it, I fail   you're a first- time customer and I fail to give you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had. Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance? No. Is it an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance? Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any insurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into that language.\n Well, to begin with, that may be why Petitioners' position here certainly was not reckless and the Ninth Circuit erred. But we do think that the statutory language read as a whole supports this. It could be a denial of a particular term in an insurance contract. But you have to look at   it's important to understand you look  \n I read the term as, as one of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate. The earlier part refers to the rate. An increase in any charge for, that's the rate. And then it speaks of change in the terms of coverage. I mean, that is, you know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of the insurance, whether you're insured for  \n Or it could be a reduction in the terms. I mean, these things are statutory construction issues to be litigated, and the important issue here   and they are presented in this case. They're to be litigated and the important issue is that when there is fair debate about these issues insurance companies will not be held to be willfully violating the statute if they got the answer wrong. But I think on the, on the substantive question, it's important to read \"adverse action\" in light of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light of the definition of when a notice is required to be issued, which turns upon the content of the information in the report. Thank you.\n Which is where?\n And that's on page 6a on our appendix.\n Thank you.\n Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shorr.\n Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When Congress intended to require a knowing violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly said so. It did not do so in connection with the claims here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A). In each instance where Congress wanted to allow   to require a higher mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with liability that was greater. They required knowing mens rea for the criminal provision. They required knowing mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages that are available under the act.\n What do you say to the argument from drafting history that looks at the history both of little n and little o and it points out that as originally, in the original bill, little o providing for the actual damages required a finding of gross negligence? Little n used the word \"willful\" just as it does now, suggesting that willful would not include gross negligence or something close to gross negligence like recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed whatever it always was, and if the argument from contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was changed to negligence in o. What do you say to that argument?\n Justice Souther, I think the only thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence to negligence. I don't think that tells us much about willful means, what willful means as a separate matter.\n But the fact that they had originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about what they had in mind in n. And they must have had something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n which was a standard higher than gross negligence.\n No, Justice Souter, I suggest that what you can infer from that is that, if anything, is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence in that circumstance. But that still doesn't tell us separately what \"willful\" meant, and of course \"willful\" had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless disregard. And I respectfully disagree with  \n Well, I mean, there's no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context. But we also keep repeating, you know, \"willful\" is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context. And here the argument is that if you look to the context of the, of the two statutory sections right up next to each other, you can draw a, an inference about what \"willful\" means.\n I think if anything, Justice Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly required the knowing standard and that's a knowing violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. And the statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is under this law. So that reference to knowing could not refer to a knowing, knowing the facts. And of course, willful in some sense always includes some knowledge of the factual circumstances. In addition, the logical structure of the act   as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual damages. We have a reckless standard, a knowing or reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but then an even higher level for the criminal and higher statutory penalty provisions. And as I started to say, a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and other similar cases.\n Counsel, even if you're right about the standard, how can you suggest that it's willful here when you have no judicial construction, you have no administrative construction, you have the statutory language that at least the questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly clear? How can you suggest that the action of the companies on this case even under your standard was willful?\n Mr. Chief Justice, of course we believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not need further interpretation by the Court.\n So if we don't agree with you on that, you would lose on the application of the willfulness standard?\n If you don't agree with us  \n In other words, your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful violation depends upon your assertion that the statute is perfectly clear?\n I think that there is a level of objective component that the statute at least has to be understood by a reasonable person at some level using standard statutory construction. But that isn't to suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a higher court or even a district court for counsel to get guidance. And of course, in this case, there was no guidance supporting Respondents   excuse me   no guidance supporting Petitioners', defendants', position. In fact, the only guidance supported our position, including guidance from the FTC.\n You're talking about the Ball letter?\n I am talking about the Ball letter.\n That wasn't even binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded as authoritative?\n It was not, and we are not suggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron deference. But if you get past the minimal level of objective standard, the question becomes what indicia and markers were out there that would have guided this company as to whether there was a high risk that they were violating the act. And certainly the Ball letter, which was sent by the staff specifically to address this exact question and to guide insurance companies, gave notice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than the best available rate based on their credit score was an adverse action. And in addition, there was  \n Well, how could that be? I mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's clear the other way. That is, if you look at the language, as you've just heard, if you look at the purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an instance where a person has continuous accidents. He's a reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in just a category below the bottom and they read his credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he always pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not to the top category, but they give him a much better deal. And you're saying this statute means that what I just described is an adverse action based on a credit report?\n Yes.\n Yes. Okay. And then if you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and then in light of the following: The little boy who says wolf. You're probably puzzled what I mean by that. I mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there will be tens of millions of notices going out and they'll have the same effect on the public that these privacy notices have today. We get them every day, dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, because they will become meaningless because to an average person that notice will not mean that he better look at his credit report. It will mean throw it in the wastebasket. All right, now I've got the purpose, I've got the language, and I have what I think of as common sense. Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.\n This is a different question. We've been talking about willful up to now.\n Yes, and this is the adverse action question.\n You haven't addressed adverse action at all.\n And I'm happy to do so now.\n Yes. But, was there anything further on willful? You said that the statute was clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice, but now we know that courts have divided on this question, right? On  \n Divided in the sense   well, the Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district court's ruling so there's no current division, but if that's what you mean, yes, Your Honor. In a   I guess I'll address quickly your question. There's additional guidance provided by the FTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was 16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that instance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and comment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined very broadly and it includes any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact. And that plays in the subjective aspect as well, but addressing your question, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory language  \n It's pretty sloppy lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be considered to have   wow. This is a standard?\n That was  \n Any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact.\n That was guidance, Your Honor.\n This is guidance?\n That was guidance. That was guidance to provide in the context of reading this statute, it should be read broadly.\n But you know, I would tell my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.\n In addition, the CEO would have the guidance provided by the Ball letter. But again addressing your question, Justice Breyer, an increase based on credit, if we had let's say an increase based on race, someone goes in and has a product to buy and there's the best rate, and they charge someone else based on their race a higher rate, certainly that's an increase based on credit. There's only one best rate.\n But this is not an antidiscrimination provision. It doesn't say anyone who discriminates in the setting of race has to send out letters. It requires an adverse action. It requires an increase in the charge.\n And Your Honor, I was only using that example to try and explain the statutory language.\n It doesn't explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race, of course that's an increase based on race.\n Well, here we have  \n And if you refuse to give a person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based on race. That is discrimination based on race.\n You're charging someone more based on credit.\n That's true, and it's a discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. You decreased it.\n I think  \n It's still a discrimination, it's still unlawful.\n Applying it to credit, a natural definition that is charging someone more than you charge others is an increase.\n When you say more, in order for there to be an adverse action there has to be an increase or an unfavorable change. And when you have an initial application you have to figure out what is the baseline in order to determine whether there has been an increase or an adverse action. And you and the Solicitor General just assert that the baseline in that situation is the best possible rate that you can get, but I don't understand where that comes from.\n Because charging someone more than someone else who qualifies for that better rate based on their credit, is increasing them, charging them more, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose, which I think was a question you asked  \n Let me look at the language. Go back to give me   because in ordinary English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase, but maybe there is a technical term in the technical language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word increase means decrease. And if you   is there anything you want   no. It's a serious question, at least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses this word increase in the way you just suggested.\n We believe that it's a standard dictionary definition, to charge someone more for insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is increasing their charge.\n Which dictionary shall I look at?\n I think we can look at any dictionary. I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but  \n They're making this argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago when you alluded to statutory purpose. I think this is what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong. One purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the consumer's credit report may contain errors which are doing the consumer some kind of damage.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n And you want this consumer alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and correct it if possible.\n That's exactly right.\n Reading the adverse action the way you read it, it would give the consumer or consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. In every case in which the consumer might have done better if the credit report had assumed different facts, on your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say I want to look at that report and correct it if it's wrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the fallacy of saying because that is one object of the statute, every term within the statute has got to be read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that object? And the trouble that we're having on the bench is that discrimination and increase are different terms. Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination does not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the basis of your argument?\n I think it has to be an increase based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to that statutory purpose is an increase above what you would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit and of course  \n Well, that's a way to give every conceivable effect to that policy. But the statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer described. Everybody will be getting notices and the notices will be meaningless.\n I don't think the notice is problematic because you're alerting the consumer to check that the information that the insurance company expressly relied on to increase your charge  \n To set the charge. I mean, that's circular. To set the charge that it gives you.\n I don't think you need a prior charge to suffer an increase. If I walk into a candy store and I've never purchased that candy before but the best price that day is 5 cents but they say we're going to charge you 10 cents, I've certainly suffered an increase.\n By that you're talking linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose. So I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and that's about 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't have the best possible credit score. Now I take it that means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that, since it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people. And if that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out notices. And that's why I asked my question about the boy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive, that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on that?\n Sure. The   as an initial matter, it's not the perfect credit that is the standard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's best rate. And that's a much broader standard. We don't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA 6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six. And of course not everyone is going to get the notice. If your driving record totally eliminates   if you have great credit but your driving record eliminates the possibility that you qualify for the better rate, you wouldn't get notice in that circumstance either. But the key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but the information that the insurance company looks at is incorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect information without ever having the opportunity to tell the insurance company or whoever is collecting that information for them, you've charged me the wrong amount and I in fact qualify for that better rate.\n Don't you have that right independently, though, every year to look at a copy of your credit report?\n Well, what's significant here, that has been added to the statute in the last two years. But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving notice at a critical time, when the insurance company tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an adverse action. I wanted to also mention, here it's not just an increase. There's also been a denial, and that Mr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied insurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so that is also an adverse action under the act.\n When you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate, why is that? Why wouldn't you look at it relative to say the average insured who walks in the door?\n Because that   GEICO's argument, and I think that's what they want, presumes they're looking at accurate credit information. And the problem is, Congress has always told that there is significant inadequacy in the credit information. I think it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center brief. In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate in consumer information was 50 percent and there was a 20 percent serious error in the rates. Under GEICO's interpretation  \n I don't understand what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?\n Because under GEICO's theory of the statute you may never get notice, even though you're being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate information, as long as you're not charge   your charge doesn't move below average. So a lot of people who are in fact intended to be protected under this act will not be protected until their charge goes below average, even though the insurance company is continuing to charge them more based on inaccurate information.\n Why do we   how do we know that they were intended to be protected in this way by getting this notice? That's the issue in the case.\n Because going through the statute and the increase based on credit, and then the notice will give them the opportunity to check. Since the consumer here is the   it's a system of checks and balances, and unless you give this consumer the opportunity to check that they are in fact using the correct information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't driven down by identity theft, you can continue to charge people more  \n Okay. So that's  \n   based on inaccurate information.\n Your basic argument is the statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer to ask to see his credit report. That's your basic premise?\n Both based on the premise and purpose of statute, yes.\n All right.\n Briefly addressing the application of the standard to the facts in this case, we do think it's appropriate to remand for further consideration in light of some new developments. GEICO has just recently produced documents to us that addressly   directly address the question of scienter here, so if there's   if you go past a minimum threshold  \n I've read your reference to those documents. Explain why you think that's so important.\n Because those documents directly address the subject of standard here, that GEICO was reckless or understood their  \n How do those documents shed any light on recklessness? I didn't see that.\n I'm sorry, Your Honor?\n How do the documents that you describe shed any light on the extent of their recklessness, if any?\n I want to be careful, because I had presented   I asked to lodge them with the Court and I can quote them if necessary, but within those documents there is direct evidence that GEICO interpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not putting someone in the best tier based on credit  \n Who's GEICO? I mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law means. If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I think you could read it this way, does that mean that GEICO reads it that way?\n No, Your Honor. In this instance, this document involves top level GEICO executives. And with respect to the advice of counsel issue, frankly it's a red herring. We have never asked to compel the Defendants in either of these cases or any of the cases we're involved in, to waive their privilege. They've got the right, of course, to offer advice of counsel as an affirmative   as a defense in this case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove our case to even reach what the counsel said. We believe we can prove our case based on the documents and subjective intent alone.\n I still don't really understand this part of the case very much. Assume that a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three different ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous, and we think the government's reading is the better reading. And the executives think about it and they say no, we don't think that's right. Has that proved reckless disregard?\n If the statute was clear and the guidance  \n If the statute's clear. And of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge thought it was clear, but the other way.\n And with respect to the district court, we believe the district court here clearly erred, as the Ninth Circuit found. And the guidance   that opinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at issue here. The only guidance, again, available at the time supported our reading of the statute. There was no guidance from and court or from the FTC, or from anywhere that would have supported Defendants' interpretation at that time. So that's another aspect of inquiry, the subjective intent of the Defendants. If there are no other questions?\n Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.\n If I could start by just responding to the issue of the new document, I just want to emphasize that this document was created by people who weren't lawyers. It was done before GEICO even started using credit to price insurance. They were   said they were brainstorming about what the statute might mean. And I would point the Court to the supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO implemented the policy that we're talking about here, the   they said that the intent was that we would send to the people who were supposed to get the adverse action notice. With the early systems development we didn't have the ability to identify whether they were supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because they had not yet developed the way to do with what they call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't taken credit into account at all. And this is a procedure that's required actually in most States in order to ensure that those who don't want to allow access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning of those State laws, and that means worse than the average loss ratio. So there's nothing in this record, even if you take into account the documents they're talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law. With respect to a few of the factual or   issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately 80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new insurance to now have to get notice under the standards established by the Ninth Circuit. With respect to who can qualify for the top tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO, approximately 10 percent. So 90 percent of the consumers would not qualify for that. And the statute very plainly does not prohibit differential treatment based on persons with better credit, nor do State laws. And so the analogy as to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you can't treat any person of a different race in a different way, and that's not true under this statute. And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't   if we're treating you worse than we would have treated you if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll send you the notice.\n Why did they use credit reports? Is it just a hedge against late premiums and the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk factors generally?\n Well, generally there are about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a good credit history is generally regarded as responsible, and responsible people tend to make less claims. And so, again, it's just one factor of 15 though.\n Yeah. May I ask this question? The reading of the statute in subsection i about, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to favor your view. But subsection ii about denial of employment really seems to read in favor of the government's reading.\n Well actually, I think that when you factor in employment, it has   it has the opposite effect. Because what happens here is if you're using employment verification reports, consumer reports about employment, there are all kinds of consumer reports. How do you tell who had the optimal employment history? How could the baseline be the best employment history possible?\n No. But my point is, it seems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems like the first applicant would be an adverse employment action under subparagraph ii, just   do you see what I'm trying to say?\n That if you   that in other words, if you gave someone a lower salary  \n It adversely affects any current or prospective employee. Now the language in i isn't, it doesn't read that way. But the thing that's troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the light of what ii seems to say.\n Your Honor, I think that if GEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less because you looked at their credit report, then GEICO would concede that that is in fact an adverse action. So I don't think it's inconsistent at all. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Thank you, Miss Mahoney. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that it wanted the Department of Labor to define the boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship services exemption. And I think that has two important implications for this case. First of all, when the Department has filled in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as they are permissible implementation of the statute. Second, and particularly specific to this case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one. And here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by far the most sensible one. Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to the second issue first, because I think that's the source of a lot of the concern in this case. Plainly the two regulations, section 10   552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down the present regulation, have some inconsistency between them. But it is also plain that the Department could not have intended to say at one and the same time that the only employers entitled use the exemption were homeowners and then say in another section promulgated at the same time that also third-party employers are entitled to the exemption. So the question is, how does one resolve this apparent inconsistency? And the Secretary says, well, the only regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals specifically with the issue of third-party employment is 552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party Employment. And that section 552.3, while containing some language that might be read to address that issue, in fact deals with several other topics. Specifically it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are involved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs, footmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in a private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in the private home of the person receiving the services. So it's not enough, for example, for somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby sitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the house of the person receiving the services.\n I thought the words were home of the person who employs, not who receives the services but who employs.\n Oh, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. The literal language is not specifically what I was saying. What I'm talking about is the Secretary's attempt to resolve what is an apparent inconsistency between the literal language in 552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).\n By   reading out the words \"of the person who employs\" her?\n Well, essentially reading them to say they, they were not intended to address directly the subject of third party employment which is the subject addressed in 109(a). And I think if one is   even leaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary for a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking about making a fair resolution of these conflicting provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first thing that one would do is apply the canon that the specific provision controls the general. And if one looks at the two provisions, section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing and one thing only: that is third party employment. And it says explicitly and straight out that persons who are employed by third-party employers are   or third-party employers who employ persons performing domestic services are entitled to the exemption.\n I thought it also addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just people who have companionship services. So if you have a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.\n That would be true. Now that would be inapplicable  \n What's a footman? I don't even know what a footman is. (Laughter.)\n What is a footman?\n I think that may be beyond my expertise, Justice Scalia. The   of course that doesn't address anything beyond companionship services, of course, because there is not an exemption beyond that. And that's one of the interesting things about 552.3. In addition to generally dealing with this question of what kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion of the exemption for companionship services, because jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not subject to the exemption. So it really looking at what 552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that   at the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as well. And the Department has taken that position. It says this is, in fact, the only definition of domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it is not just intended to be limited to the particular situation of the exemption. It applies more broadly than that to coverage as well. So I think in all those senses, Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3 deals with a number of other subjects. Now, one other thing on the statutory interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that Respondent offers also leads to the problem that essentially sets up a tension with another one of the regulations which is 552.101(a). 552.101(a) which I'm sorry   I don't have the right page number here   it is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition   has, carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to. But then it also says that this includes people who are commonly referred to as private household workers. And the one thing we know from the Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and also from what the Department has said before this Court is that that term at the time was defined by the Department and known by Congress to constitute more than just employees employed by the homeowner. There was a special second category for people who worked in the home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but were employed by a third party agency. Now somewhere underlying all of this question, I think, is statutory interpretation and indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to employees who work for third parties. And I would just like to suggest that there really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have wanted that. First of all, third participate employers such as private agencies provide services for the particular group of people which Congress was trying to assist with this exemption. People who by reason of age or disability are unable to care for themselves. Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the background screening for employees. They can provide necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents and things like that. So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit unusual.\n Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).\n Uh-huh. Yes, Your Honor.\n Page 77a as you said. But what is your argument there? I mean, that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision that you say we should ignore or at least should accept the Secretary's reinterpretation of.\n Well perhaps, perhaps I wasn't as clear as I intended to be. It does, as I indicated, have the language about the private home of the employer.\n That's right.\n However, the   the preceding sentence says the term, referring to the term that is at issue in 552.3, domestic service employment, includes persons who are frequently referred to as private household workers. The fact is that those two statements are inconsistent with each other. The term cannot be limited to employees of the home owner and also include persons who are frequently referred to as private household workers, at least if one means all the persons referred to  \n Yeah. I see. Is that clear in the   in the specific Senate report that is referred to here?\n In the specific Senate report, in both the '73 and the '74 reports  \n This, the one that's cited in the regulation itself. Because I   otherwise, I don't, I ignore those things. That's cited in the regulation. Does that report say it?\n What? The report uses the term private households workers frequently interchangeably with the term domestic employees. That is what is clear from the report itself. Now, the Department of Labor when it was reporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to do, the Department of Labor used the term private households workers, specifically defined in there by the Department, to say this means not just employees employed by the homeowner but also people who are employed by third parties. So I think it is a fair assumption that when the Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it in the same manner that the Department of Labor reports have. And, in fact, at one point in the   moving further backward in the legislative history, Senator Dominick actually quoted that language, the definition from the Department of Labor, on the Senate floor during the debates.\n I thought that the Department of Labor's first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to third-party employers. That was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't it?\n No, Justice Ginsburg. I believe that's correct. There was a, an opinion letter from the Department in November of 1975   this is an opinion letter that's cited at page 21 of the Solicitor General's brief   which specifically stated that the exemption applied whether the employee was an employee of the homeowner or of a public or private  \n I'm referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock. I thought the original notice and comment rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to third-party employers.\n I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I misunderstood the time frame we were dealing with. In the notice of proposed rulemaking, actually I would disagree with that characterization also. The notice of proposed rulemaking made a division among third-party employers. It said the exemption would not be available to those third-party employers who were covered enterprises but it would be available to those who were not covered enterprises.\n Well, wait. Does the notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's position?\n No, it does not.\n I didn't think it did. They're just floating an idea. You know  \n That's correct.\n Run it up the flagpole, see if  \n Well, that it solicited comments on that proposal. And after the comments, it changed its position to say no, in fact, all third-party employers will be exempt.\n And   and there was no further discussion of it after   after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?\n Yes, if I can just   if I can quibble with the premise of the question. The first time it said some third-party employers would be exempt and some wouldn't. Then when it changed  \n Some would be the ones that qualified as   what is the phrase, enterprises engaged in commerce?\n That's correct   those would be the ones under the proposed rulemaking that would have been denied the exemption. When in fact   when, in fact, the Labor Department said no, in fact, the exemption should apply to all third-party employers, it said it found that more consistent with the statutory language. And it also said it was more consistent with what it had done under other regulations which had been passed under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n Mr. Farr, would you agree that the position expressed in the notice itself would have   in the original notice would have been consistent with the statutory language?\n I'm not sure of that, Justice Stevens, to be honest with you. I mean one of the difficulties here in answering that is that I think, because the Department has such broad authority under 213(a)(15) to define and delimit the term, I think what's consistent with the statute has expanded somewhat. On the other hand, I have to say I don't really see where there would be in the language of the statute any basis for drawing a distinction between different kinds of third-party employers. The phraseology in the coverage provisions, the phraseology in the exemption provisions, really doesn't allow for that in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation.\n Well there would be a basis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.\n I mean, it's possible, but as I say, the   I mean, among the difficulties that covered enterprises is not just corporations and big and small corporations. Covered enterprises beginning in 1974 includes state and local governments. So what Congress would have been addressing here, if it had been squarely facing the issue, would have not just been the question of how to treat large and small corporations, but whether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered enterprises such as state and local agencies who, in fact, do provide a lot of the direct employees who provide companionship care. They have a lot of employees who actually go into homes and care for people who are employed by state and local governments. And I think it would be a little bit unusual for Congress, who is reasonably solicitous of state interests, to deny them an exemption that would have been of considerable importance to them. As the State of   or the City of New York brief points out, this is a very extensive endeavor.\n Were they covered before, before there was any provision that dealt with household workers? If state and localities were considered enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they were   they had no exemption before, their companion care people, just as household workers, would be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n No, but I think, Justice Ginsburg, the important point is they were not covered prior to 1974. There were certain  \n They were not treated as covered enterprises.\n That's correct. They were   they were, if they worked in schools or institutions like hospitals. Other than that, they were not until 1974. That's exactly correct. This, in fact, would have been denying them an exception at the very time that for other occupations aside from companionship services, they were first having coverage applied to them. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Thank you Mr. Farr. Mr. Salmons.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The FLSA's companionship services exemption applies by its terms to any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for the aged or infirm. The Act imposes no limitation based on the identity of the employer. And the Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the exception to employees of third parties is entitled to deference. The Department expressly invoked its statutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109, 552.109. It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking procedures both in 1975 and each time it considered amending the regulation. And States and care providers have relied upon it in devising systems to provide appropriate services to the aged and the infirm.\n So if the Department of Labor had enacted its regulations as originally proposed, those regulations would have been invalid?\n No, I don't think so, Your Honor. If you're referring to the initial proposed rulemaking that would have exempted only some third parties, we think that would have been a permissible reading of the exemption given the fact that the Secretary is provided very broad defined limit authority. But we certainly think there's nothing in that exemption that precludes the construction that's been adopted here. In fact, we think it is the most consistent with that language. The language of 5523 upon which Respondent relies does not change that conclusion. While if read in isolation that language could require that domestic service employees have to provide their services in the home of the employer, it should be not   it should not be given that reading for the reasons explained in the Department's 2005 advisory memorandum. The Department's construction of its own regulations contained in that memorandum is itself entitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and its construction harmonizes the various provisions at issue here far better than Respondent's reading of 553 does.\n The statute treats together babysitters and elder care people, but I take it the babysitters if they were working for an agency rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any exemption? Is that right?\n That's correct, and that's tied to a specific term that only applies to the exemption as to babysitters. The only thing that's exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a casual basis. Congress certainly could have included a casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption for companionship services. We think it's very notable that it did not and we read from that that Congress wanted all domestic service employees providing companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those individuals who most need this type of care have the opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.\n Isn't it odd that this   the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were not covered before. So it added household workers. And yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on adding people, it also subtracted people who were covered before, took them out, removed them from the coverage of the Act.\n Well, we think that that is the consequence of the companionship services exemption, but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is and based on the textual difference between, for example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the exemption for companionship services. The exemption here expresses no limitation based on the identity of the employer and we think it was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that what Congress had in mind here was a categorical exemption based on the type of services that are being provided; and while that may mean that there are certain workers who are now exempt who were not previously exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in 1974 focused on this problem of companionship services being provided to those who cannot care for themselves; and we think that follows from the text, and for the reasons Congress adopted that.\n Mr. Salmons, can I ask you a question about the importance of the whole litigation. Am I correct in believing that there's a provision in the law that protects the defendants from damages liability if they relied in good faith on the regulation, so that what we're really talking about is whether the regulation would apply in the future rather than there being a damage issue in the case?\n Well, there is a safe harbor provision that allows for reliance by employers on a statement by the agency.\n That would clearly apply to this case, would it not?\n We certainly think it would. I take it Respondents in this case would disagree and would point to the language of 552.3. I'm not sure, for example, how the Second Circuit would have resolved that question, given the way it viewed the statute here. But we do think that that would apply and so I think one view of that would be it's largely prospective.\n So in your view we're really faced with a question of whether the regulation should be given prospective effect.\n I'm sorry? What would be given prospective effect?\n As to whether the Government's position should be given prospective effect because the past liability doesn't   the damage liability just doesn't exist.\n Well, that is our view. Again, I think that would be an issue that would be litigated and I'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds of cases that are being filed under this provision. And I think it's   one of the concerns I think of the agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the regulation are to be reconciled and applied.\n Not seemingly conflicted. They conflict.\n Well, I certainly don't take issue with that. I think that there are a variety of things that point to the conclusion that the language in 552.3 that refers to \"in the home of the employer\" simply cannot be read literally. It was borrowed from the Social Security context and if read the way Respondents do we think would raise a serious question about the scope of coverage because the agency has always viewed 552.3, notwithstanding the initial line that says \"For purposes of the exemption,\" to provide the relevant definition for coverage as well. And no party, or amici for that matter, before this Court nor the Department thinks that there's a difference between the identity of the employer for purposes of coverage. And we also think, given the language in 101 that refers to private household workers, the definition of which was provided to Congress in a report by the Department of Labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum in 2005, which clearly applies to third party employers, suggests that 553 cannot be read literally. And of course we know that at the same time that the agency adopted 552.3 it felt the need to adopt a specific regulation dealing with the question of third-party employment which would not be relevant   which would not be necessary under Respondent's reading. If the Court has no further questions  \n Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Becker.\n Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: On October 1, 1974, just five months after the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took effect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated law-making function to define this term \"domestic service employment,\" which exists in the companionship exemption and nowhere else in the amendments. And they defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to companions and baby sitters employed by the household. At the same time, DOL provided a persuasive explanation for that definition. The Department found that such companions and baby sitters when employed by covered enterprises had been covered prior to the amendments and that it could not have been Congress' purpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to extend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage. The very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of the amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act. Therefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974 that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny the Act's protection to previously covered domestic service employees. The definition in 552.3, which expressly applies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with the final third-party regulation.\n Was that later?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n How much later?\n The final regulations were promulgated in February of 2005.\n No, no. I thought that the provision that was   what is the number   - where they say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many years later.\n No, no, Your Honor. That was in the final regulations, which were promulgated in February   excuse me   in 1975, not 2005.\n I mean, you read  \n In the final regulations.\n You read 3 and 3 says what you said it says. All right. How much later did they promulgate 109?\n That was in the final regulations in February of 75.\n The same time that 552.3 was finally promulgated.\n That's correct.\n They came out together, right?\n That's correct.\n That's what I thought. So the same day they say, 3, you have to have these domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick, and then in 109 they say you don't.\n That's correct. There's a direct conflict.\n All right. Now, why is that a conflict? Let's imagine   it sounds like a conflict. But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation that says birds for purposes of this are animals that fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way, penguins don't and they're still covered. I mean, why is that a conflict? There are lots of specific situations. If I read that, I would have thought, well, okay, they have an exception.\n Your Honor, the definitional regulation, 552.3, explicitly defines a term used only in the companionship services exemption, \"domestic service employment.\" And it defines it clearly and explicitly to apply only to employment by the household. Therefore, there is a direct conflict with the so-called third party employer regulation, which appears to say that the exemption can apply to employees employed by third parties. The importance of the conflict is twofold. One, when the original regulation was proposed the Department provided a persuasive explanation. Congress surely didn't intend to contract coverage in amendments designed explicitly to expand coverage.\n Did Congress intend to cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they live in their house, there's only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution. Their children hire a companion to look after them. Now, that's a third party.\n Your Honor, that question has been posed by some of the amici and it is a good question, but not the question before you.\n Because?\n And I submit that if the Department construed section 552.3 to say when our words say \"employed by the household\" that could include a broader notion of the household, for example a son or daughter living outside the household, that might be a permissible construction of the Department's own regulation. But the construction which simply takes those words  \n It doesn't say that. It says \"about, in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed.\" I live in San Francisco. My mother lives in Massachusetts. Now, if I hire a companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom she is employed. So if we're being literal and if you win this case, I don't see how   and I'm worried about this, obviously   however   and I think it's probably very common, that all over the country it's the family, the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so they don't have to be brought to an institution. And if you win this case, it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who will move to institutions. Now, if I were to say that that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a legal point because it's a question of what people intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the truth. It is a very worrisome point.\n It's a very important question of public policy and therefore let me answer in two ways. One, I think there is a proper procedure even under the existing regulations to address that concern. The elderly individual that you're concerned about who is severely disabled and thus needs this care, the child or family member who is employing the companion to care for them could do so as their guardian, and therefore as a technical legal matter would be doing so, the employment would be by the person who resides in the home.\n It wouldn't take a whole lot of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to his mother, who could then hire.\n Exactly.\n I mean, a clever lawyer would think of that, I think. (Laughter.)\n A clever lawyer could do this.\n And perhaps there are people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see through that kind of thing.\n But let me answer the second  \n And there are many   maybe Justice Scalia has the answer.\n Let me answer a second way to what is a serious concern. And the second way the situation could be dealt with is by the Department of Labor. They could look at their regulations and say, the industry has changed and therefore, in a way which could certainly be consistent with Congress's intent because it would not be withdrawing coverage from a previously covered employee who was employed by an enterprise, we could say that the exemption applies to companions and baby sitters employed by private individuals, including the homeowner, the son or daughter, etcetera.\n You're saying it's permissible to change the rules because the industry has changed. Is it not possible that the industry changed at about the time the statute was enacted? That the prevalence of third-party employers is something that really developed later?\n As an empirical matter, that is clearly the case, Justice Stevens. However, we know several things about Congress in 1974. We know that the enterprise coverage was relatively new. They adopted it in 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these very amendments in 1974. So Congress was aware of the prior coverage. We know that the Department of Labor, in the very reports which have been cited by the petitioner, stated both in January of 1973 and in January of 1974 in their reports to Congress on the Act, stated that there was prior coverage of domestics employed by third parties. We know there was enforcement activity by the Department of Labor against such third-party employers. So while the industry has certainly changed, there were enterprises who employed domestics, including companions, in 1974, and Congress was aware of it and stated over and over again in the preamble, in the committee reports, which indeed, the House committee report said, \"Our intention is to expand the act to the extent of Federal power.\"\n How   putting aside   putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible interpretation of the statute?\n Your Honor, we think it is the most plausible interpretation for the following reasons: Number one, contrary to what has been suggested, the language in the exemption is not identical to the language in the extension provision extending the minimum wage and overtime requirements. There is an important difference, and that difference is the word employment. Now that's important for several reasons. Number one, of course, coverage provisions are to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly. So there's an additional word that can and would suggest it should be read as a term of limitation. Number two, that difference must be given significance, if possible. The word should not be read to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it doesn't exist in the coverage provisions. And number three, we should avoid redundancy. There is a reading of that unique language, \"domestic service employment\", which makes sense and in fact, is exactly the reading given by the Department. Congress did not intend to  \n What employment would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment?\n The word domestic service employment is not necessary to describe what you described, Mr. Chief Justice. If that is what the Congress intended to describe, it could have said simply an employee employed to provide companionship services.\n Well, it could have said a lot of things. But I find it   you're hanging your case upon the proposition that there is a difference between domestic service employment and employed in domestic service employment. Wow. You know, I just don't see how there's any difference in those two at all.\n Your Honor  \n You're saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be. If there were a difference, I'm not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.\n What I'm suggesting is not that our case relies or hangs on that word. What I'm suggesting is if that word, that phrase, \"domestic service employment\", is given the definition which the Department of Labor itself gave it, it avoids reading two phrases which are different to mean the same thing. It avoids redundancy. And moreover, it is wholly consistent with every other piece of evidence we have about Congress's intent. Even the Department of Labor suggested it surely could not have been Congress's intent to retract coverage. The definition is consistent with that.\n Can I ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations, 552.3 and 552.   what is it, 109? I think they are contradictory. Now, the Agency has come up with a solution. We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but   you know   close enough for government work. What is your solution for solving the inconsistency? Are both of the regulations bad?\n My solution, Your Honor, has two parts but leads to the same conclusion. Our solution is that in applying the Act, which is the question here, does the Act apply to Ms. Coke's employment, this Court should apply the definitional regulations for two reasons, the definitional regulation for two reasons. One, it is the regulation, which no one disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the Department's law making function. The Department expressly defined and delimited its term \"domestic service employment\" in 552.3 and expressly said it was not doing so in the third-party regulation. So it's entitled to greater deference for that reason. But moreover  \n What's your other reason?\n It is the only definition which makes sense, which doesn't lead to a whole series of problems.\n Because of employed and domestic employment versus  \n For  \n   domestic service?\n For the following five reasons, Your Honor. One, it avoids reading a term in the statute, not only a term in the regulation but a term in the statute, completely out of the statute. And that is the term \"employment\". Secondly, as the Department found, it is consistent with what was Congress's clear intent, to expand and not to contract coverage. Thirdly, if one looks at the debates, and there was extensive and vigorous debate about these amendments, the exclusive focus in Congress was the household. The opponents were exclusively concerned with the extension of coverage to the households. So applying the exemption to protect only household employees is wholly consistent with what was Congress's exclusive  \n Well, you're getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they're about the statute. I'm assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference. And you have two regulations that are conflicting. Now, how do you decide which one prevails? Counsel for the other side says the specific governs the general, certainly an ancient prescription. Counsel also says that this is an agency regulation. The agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations. And even if the agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong, why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?\n Your Honor, of course setting aside, as you do, our argument that Congress has specific intent on this question, looking only at the regulation  \n That's statutory. I just want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the statutory  \n Let me answer in several ways. First, this Court has clearly held that an agency does not have unbounded discretion to construe its own regulations. When the terms of the regulations are unambiguous, they cannot be construed away. Now here  \n They aren't unambiguous. They contradict each other. The agency has to do something about it, and here the agency made a choice. Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, they were the mistake. One or the other had to be the mistake. We decided it was this one. Why shouldn't we take their word on it?\n Again, for two reasons, Your Honor. There's a difference between conflict and ambiguity. The words are unambiguous, and it's not simply the   there's two sets of words which they attempt to read out of the regulation, one of the unambiguous words that require employment by the person who's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory language which says the regulation only applies to the exemption. So in the guise of deference, the Solicitor General and the petitioners actually suggest to this Court that it should take apart the regulation and ignore two of its three operative provisions.\n But if they're flatly contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that .109(a) has lesser status? That's what it boils down to, isn't it?\n That is certainly my primary argument, that this statute is relatively unique in that it vested two very different sorts of authority in the Department of Labor, one a clear law making authority to actually define and delimit, to specify what the terms in the law mean  \n I'm talking about what you think the Department of Labor was doing when it promulgated 109(a). It was thinking in effect the following: We have the power to issue a regulation here that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to go through the procedure that would be necessary to issue such a regulation. But we're not invoking that power here because we want this interpretation which we think is the correct interpretation of the statute not to be followed   not to get as much deference from the courts as it would if we were invoking our power. Does that make any sense? That an agency would proceed in that way?\n Your Honor, it not only makes sense, it's been the Department's pattern since the Act was adopted. That is, the Department since the Act was adopted has split its regulations into those under the exemptions   for example the primary exemption for professional, executive and administrative employees   has split its regulations under those exemptions into those which define and delimit, into those which do not define and delimit, or other general statements that apply to their interpretation.\n Yeah, but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking. You know, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate about interpretive regulations. In fact, probably most of the significant regulations of the most important agencies are interpretive regulations.\n The important difference here, Justice Scalia, is the statute. The statute, like the tax statute which was interpreted by this Court in Vogel and Rowan, creates two types of authority. And not only under the Fair Labor Standards Act, but  \n I understand that you say it creates two types, but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other. What do you rely on for that?\n Your Honor  \n Where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?\n Well, let me qualify the question, if I might. The Petitioner would suggest that we're relying on simply a label, this is in the interpretive section and the other is in the general regulation section. Far from it. We are relying on a very clear statement both in the regulations, 552.2(c), as well as in both the proposed regulations and the final regulations, which clearly state that only those in Part A define and delimit. Why is that an important distinction? It's an important distinction because Congress clearly meant these two grants to be different. Otherwise, why would it have granted an express power to define and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of the general rulemaking authority?\n They're different but not necessarily of different   entitled to different respect from the courts. A defined   what is it, define and delimit? These are regulations that don't even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute, but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas, to say the   this rule won't apply to companies over this   that can't possibly be an interpretation of the statute. So Congress says we're going to give the agency that authority. In addition, of course, we're going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has, which is to interpret   interpret the language of the statute.\n Well, Your Honor, I think we can safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these two types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the law. And this Court, if you compare its decision in Addison to its decision in Skidmore, clearly itself distinguished between the exercise of those two different interpretive or rulemaking authority. Clearly in Addison, construing a very similar term in a different exemption, giving the Department of Labor the power to define a particular term in the exemption, said that is law making authority. And we will follow what the Department of Labor says unless it's clearly inconsistent with the statutory   with Congress's intent. In Skidmore, where that type of expressed delegated law making authority to define and delimit was not at issue, the Court said we will record only that degree of deference to which the regulation  \n Skidmore was before a rather significant case called Chevron.\n Absolutely, Your Honor. But it was also before the 1974 amendment. So if the question is, what was Congress intending in creating two types of rulemaking authority, the power to define and delimit, and the general rulemaking authority, I think we need to consider Congress's intent at that time.\n You mean we're going to divide all administrative law now into those   those regulations   those provisions that were adopted by Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently. Do you have any case of ours that suggests something like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of proceeding?\n Let me answer in two ways, Your Honor. One, it would not be any case. Here we have a particular statutory scheme that is contrary to  \n Ought not to get as much deference from the courts.\n Here we have a case essentially described by Justice Kennedy in & Haga, where we have a different statutory scheme combined with a explicit statement by the Agency as to which part of that scheme the Agency is operating under. But the case I would cite, or the cases would be Rolo and Rove which have not  \n Since we're into that, we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that possibly they had   they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute, because that's what it says in 552.2. It says \"this part\"   it doesn't say subpart, it says part   and part is 552. And both regs we are talking about are in the part. And B says interpretations, but they don't mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in them, and divide by 32. Nobody thinks that Congress meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide by 33. So as I read that, I thought the whole thing is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority; Part A has more general things. Part B has more specific things. Where am I wrong?\n Well, I think the question, Your Honor, is which of the regulations were promulgated pursuant to the specific authority  \n All of them. All of them is what it says unless I missed something.\n Well, I think what you missed is that a simple citation to the exemption does not translate into an exercise of the power to define and delimit. Because the Department was very, very specific as to when it was exercising that power. In 552.2(c) it says the definitions required by the legislation are provided in the following sections and it enumerates them and does not include the third-party regulation. Now Petitioners would suggest well, that's just a definition. They also have the power to delimit. However, both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the notice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising our power to define and delimit in subpart A.\n Okay. I got the point.\n But part B is different.\n Right. Right.\n So why are you sure there's a conflict in the first place? You know, 552.3 says that the term domestic service employment refers to services performed in the home of the employer. It doesn't say it only refers to that. And then you go down and 109 says it also includes employees who are employed by a third party. I mean, can't they be reconciled in that way.\n I don't think so, Your Honor. And its certainly not the way that the  \n It's not the way the Agency has done it. But you don't think we should defer to them, anyway. So   (Laughter.)\n That's correct. But the regulation   552.3 defines the statutory term which only exists in the exemption, domestic service employment.\n Yeah, but it says it refers to something. It doesn't say as many of these regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined as. And particularly when you're confronted with what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to should be read to mean includes rather than is defined as.\n Well, I think we have to read the definitional regulations together. That is, all of the terms in the exemption, companionship services, babysitting services, casual basis, domestic service employment, are all defined in the set of regulations, point 3, point 4, point 5, point 6. And it is clear from the prefatory language of each one that what the Department of Labor intended to do was define the terms in the statute. And so when it said that that term refers to  \n Well it is interesting when you look at   I mean, they're   it's a good point. It's interesting when you look at the other definitions, the babysitting, it says this provision shall mean. Here it just says it refers to. Let's see, the other ones   casual basis, shall mean. Companionship services, shall mean. This one doesn't say shall mean. It says it refers to this. I'm just wondering if that's something that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as the other definitions.\n I do not believe so, Your Honor. It is an exercise of the power to define the term and I don't think we can take that language \"refers to\" to be non-exclusive. When the Department said referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it was. If we have any doubt about what the Department intended, it actually of course reiterated that definition under the interpretive classification. And it again said that the term refers to, is defined as, employment by the household. If we had any doubt  \n Mr. Becker  \n There it says   there it says includes. And if you're talking about 552.101, there it says the term includes persons frequently referred to as private household workers.\n I'm referring to an earlier provision of the same regulation, not the reference to private household workers, but where it states that the definition includes those individuals who are employed by the household, that is in 552.101(a). But if we had any further doubt, the   that regulation refers to, as its source of the language, the regulation adopted under the Social Security Act, now 20 CFR 404.1057. It was originally numbered differently, but at the time, in 1974, that regulation which was explicitly the source of the language the Department of Labor used, said not once, not twice, but three times, that the individual had to be employed by the household.\n Mr.   Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway. So why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?\n Your Honor, setting aside, of course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3 which we've already explained, we would not say that that there is any credible evidence in the legislative history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was a factor. And let me explain why. The Department for the first time when it promulgated its advisory memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third party regulation. It said nothing of the sort in 1975. As support for the assertion it cited four isolated comments in the legislative history. None of them except the last   and there is only one of t-h-e-m related in any way to the exemption. The one that related to the exemption in fact directly supports our position, because it describes those people who are not within the exemption as the professional domestics. So we don't think that there's any basis for suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and, in fact, it is really implausible. Because at the same time, for example, Congress extended the provisions of the Act which covered nursing homes. At the same time, as has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual babysitters. Now We would submit that if Congress was concerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and companionship exemption, the primary intended beneficiaries of that would have been working families where both people worked and therefore who require a full-time baby sitter  \n Thank you, Counsel.\n   and a full-time baby is not covered. Thank you very much.\n Mr. Farr, you have three minutes remaining.\n Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. Respondent in response to Justice Scalia's question about how Respondent would reconcile the regulation 552.3 and 109(a) actually did not I believe attempt any reconciliation. If I understand respondent's position correctly, it's simply 109(a) has to be invalidated dated and 552.3 stands in its entirety. I think that's incorrect for several reasons. First of all, the basis for it is essentially this apparent distinction between the define and delimit authority and the more general authority to enact necessary rules and regulation. But, in fact, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants of authority were invoked by the Department when it enacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to either subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that Justice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to attribute to the Department to say that it would exercise two different legislative powers in different parts of the   of the regulations. There's no reason it would do that. The subpart B regulations clearly are regulations that delimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15). There's no question about that. So why in fact if it was doing what Congress authorized it to do under 213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of authority in that provision, rely on some other general grant of authority? It makes no logical sense to attribute that to the Department. And it seems to me, in   excuse me   in fact, that that argument points up one of the difficulties here. It seems to me that the arguments here are a way of simply trying to push the Department aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job of exposition on this exemption. Not only contrary to the basic principle of Chevron, which is where that where is ambiguity in the statute, or room for interpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity to do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary to the statute. It is clear as I said at the beginning of my argument, the Department was the agency chosen by Congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the exception. Now I'd like to say just one other thing in response to Justice Stevens' question about the particular nature of the litigation. This is a suit for damages. It is a suit claiming will damages. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.\n", "argument in No. 105 Original, Kansas v. Colorado ": " Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Because title to lands underlying navigable waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty, this Court has long held that there is a strong presumption that each State receives title to such lands at statehood. Under the Court's precedents, the United States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise made that intention very plain. Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case, the United States asserts that it received title to the submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title. To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the United States identifies as ratifying the purported reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains with Alaska. Under the plain language of the statute, the proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause. And this is important. In this case it is undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included within the main clause. The submerged lands, therefore, did not  \n Well, counsel, you   apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section 5  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n   of the statehood act.\n Absolutely.\n And why was Federal title to the monument not sufficient to retain title to the submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e) at all?\n Because of section 6(m), Your Honor. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides that the Federal Government retained all of the property it previously possessed with one important exception, except as provided in section 6. Section 6 has two exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here. Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the States. Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different set of properties. What section 6(e) did was to transfer to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of property, property that was used for the purposes or solely   for the sole purpose of   of fish and wildlife conservation under three designated statutes. Those are the State   local-State fish and wildlife conservation statutes. Again, here it was   it is undisputed that Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause. Therefore, the  \n   problem, as   you just said that   that the main clause is very, very narrow, and we're told by the Government that no wildlife reservation would come within that main clause, so that there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.\n The Government is incorrect, Your Honor. We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the proviso. And here's why the United States is correct on that. They argue in their brief that those properties were not included in the main clause because they were created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the Alaska Game Law of 1943. In fact, Your Honors, those are the exact same statute. The '43 Alaska Game Law simply restated the 1925 law with certain amendments. What that means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the then-existing version. These refuges were created in 1941 prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. So those are two properties. And   and actually the legislative history   we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative history because the statute is plain and also because there's a clear statement rule. But the legislative history does indicate that Congress was specifically concerned about those two very large refuges. The Kenai and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut. And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern of the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not be able adequately to manage those properties. But there was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at issue here because it was never going to be transferred to the State under the main clause.\n Why   why shouldn't we look to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?\n We are advocating the tests set out in the Idaho case, Your Honor. That test is a two-pronged test.\n Right.\n First, you have to look and see if there is a  \n Whether Congress has notice of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation, which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?\n That's   that's relevant to the first prong, Your Honor. The second prong  \n And second, whether the transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that reservation. Should we look to that?\n If the Court were examining the   the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors might be relevant. Here, though, the test is set out in not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress. And Idaho applies that. Idaho looked very carefully for some action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that case. Here, we need an action by Congress. The United States has identified what they contend is the action of Congress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act. That proviso, though, just does not cover these lands.\n Why do you say explicit? I   I thought it said you have to make it plain, which really might matter.\n In  \n What it says   the language I think is   or definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.\n Yes. In the  \n Is that right? There's nothing that says explicit. Right?\n Well, Your Honor, in the Alaska case   and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997 Alaska case. There the Court said that Congress must, quote, explicitly recognize or that Congress had explicitly recognized the resignation in that case. So the   the Court  \n But doesn't that simply mean that if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.\n Yes.\n But it doesn't mean that it must be explicit in every case. Isn't that correct?\n Well, I   I think explicit  \n You don't have to be explicit to make it plain. It's a great way to do it, but that's   it's not the only way.\n It has to be definitely   Justice Breyer, you're correct. It has to be  \n All right.\n   definitely clear or otherwise made plain. Yes.\n If I'm correct, then   if I'm correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here we have a national park and we want to keep the national parks as the United States, which you'd expect. It's a national park. And of course, they want to keep the whole thing. I mean, it's obvious. You don't have to write everything that's obvious. They no more want to give all the water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give the gamekeeper's part to Alaska. A house, or maybe there's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention either, but it's just obvious that unless there's something very special about the water, that the water in the park is part of the park.\n Well, there is something special about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has recognized. The water is a State   an essential attribute of State sovereignty, and just to  \n I understand that. But I mean, it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're giving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's even underground water. But I mean, what the argument I think is   would be is this like that, and the argument that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need this water in order to study the glaciers because there are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora and fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's good enough. Now, what's your reply?\n First of all, the geysers are not included because we're talking about navigable  \n I understand that. I'm using a funny example to  \n Yes. Navigable waters. (Laughter.)\n But let me   let me just assure the Court. There is nothing at all unusual about State-owned submerged lands within national monuments. The reason is simple. The Antiquities Act, which allows the President to designate national monuments, was enacted in 1906. At that time there were 45 States already in the Union. Therefore, any national monument created in those 45 States would necessarily have included State-owned submerged lands unless there had been some conveyance. And let   let me give Your Honors a   a concrete example. In the 1978 California decision decided by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national monument off the coast of California, included State-owned submerged lands because even though the reservation order was asserted to have included those lands, there was no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the State's title. Another  \n Like in Yellowstone. There is a river I think. Who owns that?\n Well, Yellowstone was created before the State of Wyoming and  \n No. But I mean, does the State or the Feds own the   the river that goes through it?\n One would need to examine the particular reservations and statutes there.\n What about in Yosemite? I think there's a river down there too. Is the river in Yosemite owned by California or by the   the Feds?\n I'm not familiar with that, but I will give you an example that I am familiar with.\n Before you do that, Mr. Franklin, is   is the rule that   that we're operating under that Congress had to have made it clear  \n Yes.\n   that it reserved, or is the rule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved it?\n No. It's the former rule, Your Honor.\n It's the former.\n Yes.\n So the mere fact that it doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n Right, but normally you assume, I guess, that Congress does what is   tries to avoid things that are ridiculous. So if they say keep the park, I guess the question would be is that included. I mean  \n It's not  \n   can you read it this way? I   I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?\n Well, first of all, this is not the ordinary   in this case we presumed the   the opposite. In fact, there's a strong presumption. But let me give you the other example that I was going to refer to you.\n Yes.\n There's something called the California Coastal National Monument. That extends the entire length of California and goes out 12 miles to sea. In that monument, the   the lands, the submerged lands, are both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they are managed cooperatively. And that's what we are seeking to do here. And importantly, the fact  \n Mr. Franklin, are   are these submerged lands covered by navigable waters?\n Yes.\n What is it that the Government could do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want to do, that they cannot do simply by   by reason of   of having jurisdiction over the navigable waters?\n There are a few things, presumably very localized activities that the State would have the exclusive authority in. Importantly though, the Federal Government, even though the State owns title here, will retain all of its constitutional authority under the Interstate Commerce Clause to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce that  \n Yes, but just as a practical matter, tell us what you're arguing about. What does Alaska think it can do if it prevails in the Glacier Monument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical matter?\n As   as a practical matter, there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing that are important to the State. There are issues relating to local uses of the bay. But more importantly  \n Well, could   could you be concrete? I mean, there   I don't know what you mean. What are the issues? Can you give me an explicit example?\n Well, one explicit example is I think the State would prefer to have more local subsistence fishing in the bay. And the Court   to   to move out a bit, the  \n So the State would permit more fishing than the U.S. would allow  \n I think  \n   as a practical matter.\n As a practical matter. And   and there   there  \n But couldn't Congress forbid that under   by reason of its control of the navigable waters  \n Well, if  \n   if it really wanted to?\n If Congress really wanted to, Congress could   could affect activities relating to interstate commerce. But importantly, what Alaska seeks here really is a seat at the table. Right now Alaska has no say over anything that happens in its navigable waters which are its sovereign State lands. What it seeks really is to have its views being considered. Right now   and I'll give you a concrete example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the   in the next count that I'll discuss. For some time cruise ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside   or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of Federal laws. That was fixed, but it took an act of Congress to do that. There had to be an act of Congress to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge out in these, what they used to call, donut holes. Alaska finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress every time something comes up on its navigable waters that it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with. Now, if Congress decides to preempt the State under its interstate commerce power, it has the right to do that. I think we also need to keep in mind what waters we're talking about. This is southeast Alaska. The waters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the region. They are central to the economy, the history, the society, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live there and who travel there. Just to take an example, there are still today very few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the   the towns and the cities like the   the State capital of Juneau historically were accessible only by the water. This is an area   the water in particular is an area that is of great importance to Alaska. And they are seeking to confirm that that area does belong to Alaska. And I think we have set forth in quite detail why  \n Well, there   there are big differences between the   the analysis concerning the bays that you assert and Glacier Monument. I think they're quite different.\n Well, the   the tests are different. The Glacier Bay test involves   needs to have an explicit reservation   explicit ratification by Congress of a reservation and  \n You're lumping them all together, but I think the tests are quite different.\n The tests are different. What I was trying to explain is, in answer to Your Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska. It matters quite a deal.\n But in   in respect to Glacier Bay  \n Yes.\n   I   I mean, is the only   you said, for example   is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?\n There are two issues. I think it's fishing and also to allow more local people to visit the area that would otherwise be prohibited by the Park Service. There was   but just to assure Your Honors  \n How could they do that? You mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water there, but they couldn't get off the boat?\n Well, that's normally what   what people do is they just visit the  \n I see.\n   by boats. But to assure Your Honor, there   for example, there are no mineral interests here anywhere in the picture.\n All right. So if   if the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat and to go up along the waterway and to look at the glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska, for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left of the park. I mean, it would be like   you see, if it's essential to it.\n Well, that's not true, Your Honor. 80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it included the submerged lands, is uplands. But it's no more unusual  \n No. I understand that, but I mean, it's the way of visiting the park.\n Yes, but I just mentioned, for example, the two monuments in California. The Channel Islands National Monument this Court held included the   the submerged lands were State-owned. There's no other way to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse State-owned submerged lands. In fact, I think there are few national parks in this country you can't get to without going across State lands. I think there's another important point here and that is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also allow the Federal Government to regulate activities on lands that abut national parks to the extent that they might affect park activities. But here what we need is an expressed statement by Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay. Without that, Your Honors   and the   the precedents are clear. Without that, the presumption is   in fact, the strong presumption is   that these are State-owned lands. And again, there is absolutely nothing unusual. That is part of our Federal system. It's the way that these monument properties have been managed since 1906 when the President first got the authority. It's the way that Glacier Bay will continue to be managed. We expect, we intend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government to resolve any issues that might remain. What we're seeking here, again, is a seat at the table. We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealt with because they are the owner.\n In the   in the '97 case, was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)? Because this  \n Yes. The   the Court expressly stated that it was at pages 60 to 61, and that was in the absence of any contrary argument.\n It   it made an assumption.\n The Court made an assumption, but in fact  \n But was it in fact?\n I think there would have been a substantial   had that   had that issue been litigated, there would have been a substantial argument that it was not within the main clause. But again, there was no argument on that point before the Court. The Court at pages 60 to 61 expressly stated   again, it was an assumption, but the Court expressly stated that the lands were within the main clause. Apparently the Court was considering the fact that the application for ANWR did, in fact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the main clause, the Alaska Game Law. The important point of that case for this case, though, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here, namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal Government a subset of the properties that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause. There simply was no need for Congress to have expressed an intent  \n I thought we had left that open. I thought we  \n I think what I said is that the Court embraced that position, and it was actually an essential attribute of the   essential premise for the Court's holding. At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the   the decision, what the Court made clear is it was concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso, all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was covered by the proviso. No such concern is present here. I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I might, to the count I, which is the historic waters count. There the United States asserts that at statehood the waters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated enclaves of international high seas that were wholly surrounded by U.S. territorial waters. The historical record, though, belies that contention. At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States took what this Court has described in the Mississippi Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as the publicly stated policy that the waters of the archipelago were inland and that the political boundary ran along the outside edge. Thereafter, the United States took   consistently based a discriminatory enforcement regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. What I mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.\n Well, the argument on the other side, as I understand it, is that the   the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is   is relevant. It has no necessary implication for the historic waters doctrine. What   what is your answer to that?\n That's the assertion. My answer is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975 decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202, and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief. What the Court said there is it examined an incident in which a Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general area, and the Court said   and I quote   that incident deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and, quote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the waters in question.\n What   what page was that?\n I'm sorry. That's 201 to 202   201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of the blue brief. What the law was at statehood is that the United States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign vessels. Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that is that the law has changed. The law has changed since 1971. Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a 200-mile   what's known as an exclusive economic zone that allows the United States to enforce discriminatory fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that. But   and we have quoted a UN study. In fact, the UN study that we have quoted   and that is noted at page 29 of the blue brief. That is the study that's called the Juridical Regime Study. It's the study that this Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases, has used as the authoritative statement of the law. That study quite clearly states that if a   if a country enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign vessels outside   that that manifests an assertion of an historic inland waters claim. And what we have here  \n On   on this point, it seems to me there   unlike the first point you were discussing where I think the Federal Government can work its will anyway, on this point there is really a significant Federal interest involved. That is to say, if the United States takes the position that these are, indeed, inland waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.\n No. Your Honor, they assert that, but they don't provide any specific examples. And the reason they can't provide a specific example of any instance abroad where it would affect their position is that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own facts. The fact that something is an archipelago does not render it historic waters.\n But   but you say a determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply   is simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.\n It is a claim to the   to the waters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with discriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other statements in this case, including the California brief to this Court. There has to be an   excuse me   an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before one can conclude that waters are historic waters. These ones are. Other waters would not be. The United States has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely these constellation of facts. So its   its position is basically: we say it, therefore it must be so. I  \n But it's not the United States that will be making the judgment about what areas are controlled. It would be the country abroad. And I   I think the argument was, what the United States does other nations will copy.\n Right.\n And they will decide what looks like the Alaska  \n Right. What the United States does, Your Honor, is follow the well-settled international law on historic bays   historic waters. Those are set forth in the convention. Each state will have the same authority where its facts and circumstances dictate it. If there has been a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the acquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as historic waters. But it has to be done based on a   an examination of the particular facts of the case. And one thing else   one thing other that is worth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a nation can always close it off using article 4 straight baselines. That is permitted under the convention. The U.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are fully able to do that. I think that if the United States is going to be arguing that there is some international precedent here that's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a particular body water abroad that it believes this case is going to affect.\n Why should it make that suggestion? It would certainly not be in the interest of the United States.\n Well, it   it needs to explain more specifically then, other than just stating we think it might affect our position. The   the facts and circumstances   the Court, for example, applied the historic bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the Mississippi Sound case. I am aware of no instance in which that precedent was ever used adversely and the United States has not identified any   any instance. But more importantly, what this Court did in the Mississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it said is this a historic bay or is it not. The Court concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the Court follows. At this point, I'd like to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.\n Yes, Mr. Franklin. Mr. Minear.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin with the focal point of Alaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park. Alaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the statehood act does not provide an adequate showing that the United States intended to retain the submerged lands in Glacier Bay. For this  \n Could   before you go into that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?\n Yes. In fact, I think it's very helpful. It's listed at page 7a  \n I mean, (e)  \n   of our   of the gray brief.\n Yes, but the   well   well, the   the introduction to it is   is not listed, is it? I mean  \n That may   that may be so.\n I mean, it's incomplete. It   it just says all real and   what about all real and personal property? Is there an intro that says there is hereby   there is hereby granted to the United   to Alaska?\n Well, 6(e) I think begins stating that this   these are exceptions to section 5 which is the retention   the general retention provision of the United   for United States lands. But if we look at 6(e) itself, it's  \n Well, you say they're exceptions. How   how are the exceptions introduced? I mean, it's incomplete to just read (e) that says all   what about all real and personal property of the United States? There has to be some introductory language. What is it?\n No. Actually there doesn't, Your Honor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal property   then you skip down, about halfway down   shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropriate Federal agency. So it is   so this is complete in terms of  \n Okay. Okay. You're right.\n But if I could walk you through those provisions because I think they're quite important. The first provision says, as you say, all real and personal property which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall be transferred to the United States.\n Right.\n It's followed by another provision here.\n To   to Alaska.\n To   to Alaska. Excuse me. And it's followed by another proviso which says that the United States will continue to control fish and game matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has certified that Alaska is ready to do so. Clearly that proviso is not a subset  \n Mr. Minear, before you get too far, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that was raised by Justice O'Connor before. Do you agree that section 5 itself, the second part of it that says the United States retains title to its own property, that the response to that is adequately provided in the Submerged Lands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?\n No, I don't. I don't believe   let me frame the   your   your question, if I may, for you. Section 5 indicates the United States would retain all of the lands that it presently holds. Section 6(m) then makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the   to the   to Alaska. In doing so, it recognizes that there are some lands the United States would continue to retain, provided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands Act. The particular exception we're concerned about here is the expressly retained exception, in other words, if lands are retained by the United States. This Court said in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts the general law that applied before the Submerged Lands Act, that it had to be made plain that the United States would be holding onto these lands. It doesn't require an express statement. It simply requires that it be made plain. Now, our view is that these lands would be retained by the United States, quite apart from 6   the 6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary judgment. And if you denied our motion for summary judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions that are applicable. But in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e) and we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic Coast decision made clear that 6(e)   and I quote   reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote, to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife   or reservations for the protection of wildlife.\n Well, we didn't have this issue before us. Let   let me  \n Yes, we did.\n   let me   why don't you go back to your argument? You said that the first proviso on its face is simply not a subset of the first part of (e).\n Yes. It's an example how provisos do not need to be  \n But that's not the proviso at issue here.\n Yes.\n The proviso at issue here is the second proviso which begins provided that such transfer shall not include lands. Such transfer. Now, this is   the word such refers you back to something. What   what possible transfer could it mean except the end of the introduction, which says shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska?\n Your Honor  \n I mean, anybody reading that would   would think that proviso refers to that transfer or at least it is not clear that it provides to   that it applies to every transfer in   in the whole act.\n I disagree with you, Justice Scalia, for these reasons. First of all, the such transfer simply tells you what's not included. That language tells you   this is outside. It doesn't mean that whatever follows necessarily was within the main clause. What Congress was doing here, by making clear that these lands were not transferred  \n What does the such refer to?\n It does refer to the transfer before. But what follows here, refuges and reservations for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within that   that main clause. It's obvious they don't because the only things that fit within the main clause are those lands and real property specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. What we're talking about here   wildlife reservations are multiple purpose lands. They're not used solely for   for the purpose of conservation. The purpose of the first provision here was to transfer vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State would need to enforce Alaska game laws. That was the point of   of that first provision. But Secretary Chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative history that what he was doing was drawing a line between those   those facilities and equipment that are used by a State in its traditional game management and drawing a contrast with the matters that would be retained by the United States.\n Where is the language that says that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained by the United States?\n We do not need  \n What the proviso says is just what Justice Scalia said.\n We do not need express language that expresses  \n No, no, but where is the implication in that?\n The implication is that we are retaining all of the reservation. And this is what the Court said in the Arctic Coast decision. It saw that this was  \n That's   that's   it   I mean, in   in   I take it in the Alaska case we were considering a transfer that did fall within the main sentence of (e).\n Justice Breyer, neither party made that argument. This issue came up in a letter that was written after. The   the language  \n Were we or weren't we?\n You were not considering that.\n We weren't.\n That   that was   simply neither party suggested that ANWR fell within the first provision. And it doesn't. It's clear that it doesn't. It was not land that was specifically used solely for conservation of wildlife under these three listed statutes. The ANWR reservation at that time was set apart. It was BLM land. It was also used for mining and other activities. Likewise, the other matters  \n But the Court did assume   the Court did assume that.\n Yes.\n It made that assumption with no briefing, but it did that with regard to the second issue that was presented there. The issue that people were fighting about in the Arctic Coast decision was was this land properly set apart or not for purposes of the proviso. And that's where this discussion takes place.\n All right. Then  \n It's an afterthought that simply reinforces.\n All right. Then at best Alaska is a neutral. Because we didn't think it, we're operating as a mistake. It's a neutral. Okay. Now, what's bothering me about the case is just what Justice Scalia said, that   that why I   if I sell you all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping gear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation of mess kits from some other transfer? I mean, it has nothing to do with mess kits.\n Your Honor, but that's   it's clear that what this is   this is more along the lines if someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that transfer shall not include the detached garage.\n Fine, and then it doesn't go in that.\n In that case  \n But it doesn't mean that the next  \n Yes, but it was not a part of the house.\n Yes.\n You know, that's   it's just providing clarification, just that one of the purposes of the proviso is to provide clarification.\n This is an abundance of caution?\n In other   that is exactly right. And we can tell that from  \n All right. If it's an abundance of caution, where's the other language that almost reserves it so we need the caution?\n That would be section 5. It indicates the general retention for lands of this sort.\n But 5 is subject to the Submerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you back to the reservation has to be explicit. And then   see, that's  \n Well, Justice Breyer, again, if I can just complete the point  \n That's why I was talking about Yellowstone.\n Yes.\n I was looking for something that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to transfer. He comes back and says, well, very often States do control the water.\n Your Honor, I just need to make a point. I think it's very important for you to understand this point. First of all, that at page 57 of the Arctic Coast decision, this Court was clearly reading this language, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a clear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that these particular items that are discussed there are not a part of the main clause and cannot be. And a good example of that is the third thing that's being transferred, facilities that are utilized in connection with general research activities related to fisheries and wildlife. Now, that is not going to be something that's specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. It's the antithesis of that. It makes quite clear that our construction is correct. The subset theory just doesn't work because the items that are here are not things that fit within the main clause. What Congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line  \n But why   why doesn't (m) supersede that argument anyway? Let's   can't we say that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?\n Then you have to explain what happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main provision. And that is because Congress was making   because this Court concluded that Congress was making clear that wildlife lands are very important and they wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not be transferred. And even a provision that could be misconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in   in Arctic Coast   could be misconstrued to contain some of these lands, we need to make adequate assurance that   that the courts that read this realize a clear division is being made. We are retaining these wildlife lands. That's  \n Mr. Minear, I'm   I'm not sure I agree with you that   that that language, facilities used in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the earlier   of the earlier grant, namely property used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of fisheries and wildlife. Surely one   one can readily regard general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and protecting fisheries and wildlife.\n But we're talking about a facility here. So a facility that might conduct some   some research tangentially related to wildlife is not a facility that's used for the sole   specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife. There's a clear difference here. These two   these two sets do not overlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife refuges. Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are used for multiple purposes. At the time of statehood, the   the regulations in place, the fisheries regulations and wildlife regulations, made clear that permits could be issued for purposes apart from wildlife conservation. And this Court's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized that one of the   the refuges that Alaska cites as being included in the main clause was being used for oil and gas purposes. It was not being used solely for the purposes   specifically used solely for the purposes of conservation.\n Mr. Minear, you know, I   I am just overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible mess of a statute. I can't figure out what it means.\n Well, Your Honor  \n And   and it seems to me that's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.\n Your Honor  \n There are arguments here, there are arguments there, but it   it does not dawn upon me that   that anything is clear about this at all.\n Well, this   we believe the statute has been clear for 50 years. That's why these issues have only arisen recently with regard to Glacier Bay National Park.\n Mr. Minear, what do you say are the practical consequences from the Federal Government's perspective of going   of disagreeing with the U.S. position? What harm is done? Can the U.S. protect itself in any event under other clauses?\n We agree that the United States has the regulatory authority to protect   to limit vessel entries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not what our concern is. Our concern is with the actual use of the submerged lands. This is a laboratory. This is a laboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use the submerged lands for that purpose. That includes such things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze its historic features. We've installed a 5-mile cable with a hydrophone on the   on the submerged lands so we can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the   the volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that migrate through there.\n Don't you do that on   on dry land in some States?\n Your Honor, in order to hear vehicle traffic  \n Doesn't your authority under the Commerce Clause or under   under   over navigable waters allow you to do that kind of stuff?\n Your Honor, we think that   that Alaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot withdraw materials from the submerged land which we use and study. And in fact, I would point out that the park superintendent's affidavit  \n Are they likely to do that?\n What?\n Are they likely to do that? Is this a real problem?\n There are 900 papers, scientific papers, that are cited in the affidavit of the park superintendent. This is exhibit number 8 on count IV. And of those describing the type of research we do in Glacier Bay National Park  \n Well, I thought  \n   scores and perhaps hundreds of those involve submerged lands.\n All right. Given what you're saying   and I   you're not accepting this I think, and I   well, there is language in this act which maintains in the United States title to the park.\n That is correct.\n All right. Now, I would have thought when you get title to the park, you mean the park, and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the park.\n We  \n And therefore, if you have a part of the park which is the only part of the park where people look at the park, and it's the only part of the park that brings them into the park, and it's the only part of the park where you do the research, et cetera, that's the park. Just as if I were to sell my house and I list the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen is an essential part of the house.\n That's  \n Now   now, once I made that argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but really, there are all kinds of instances where States have reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's worked fine.\n But those are instances  \n What's your response to all this?\n The instances   the examples they're giving are cases in which we've created those national monuments or parks after statehood. And in those cases, we cannot acquire those lands because they have already been transferred to the State at statehood.\n It hasn't resulted in a   in a disaster. That's the point that Justice Breyer is making.\n But in this case  \n It has not resulted in a disaster.\n But in this case, it is going to impede the   the activities we have there. And a good example of this is in the amicus brief at page 25 where Alaska does not even assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife. The Alaska legislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife within the park. This gives you some sense of the type of difficulties that we're going to encounter.\n Mr.  \n And our chief concern  \n Mr. Minear, may I ask you? At the time the statute was passed, was the national Government conducting these activities?\n Yes, it was. It was created as a national monument. Now, in terms of what degree of activities, the record is not clear, but we're  \n Maybe you were monitoring passages through to see whether the whales were going to be interfered with and doing that sort of thing. Were you taking core samples?\n We were definitely studying the bed of the lake, and our   our briefs below explain. We have an affidavit from our glaciologist which describes the type of research that was being done.\n So in   in other words, you   you're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the passage, this would have been on the congressional mind, going back to Justice Breyer's  \n It   it definitely would have. And also I want to point out that when we created the national monument, we also preserved such things as the interglacial forests. These are forests that are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go forward over these submerged lands. The glacial forests are in the submerged lands, and so they become a part of it. As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely that other glacial forests will be revealed, and those should remain a part of the park. That was part of the purpose, was to study those  \n Should. Now, you're not   how far are you prepared to go? You can't go more than your brief and your facts justify. Are you prepared to say that this water is an essential part of the park?\n Yes.\n Yes?\n Yes. Certainly  \n Have you said that before this minute?\n Not only have we said it, but the Park Service at statehood said that this is a water park when they were describing these lands and saying why they should be retained. They told Congress   the   the park superintendent or the   the director of the Park Service said this is a water park that's mostly   this is, after all, Glacier Bay National Park. And in that   with that respect, I'd like to point out this  \n Why did they keep the other 80 percent then?\n Excuse me, Your Honor.\n Why did they keep the other 80 percent?\n Well, the  \n I gather only 20 percent of it is water.\n It's slightly more than 20  \n They should have given away the rest.\n We haven't given away. We have all of these lands. The   the uplands here are the glaciers and the mountains that are inaccessible except by the water. You cannot reach these areas. There are no roads in this park except for the park visitors center, and beyond that  \n Then make it a water park. I mean, you want to say it's a   it's a water-accessible park, fine.\n Yes. But, Your Honor, the  \n 20 percent of the park is under water. Right?\n More than 20 percent. Roughly 25. I'd say close to 25 percent of the park is   within the park boundaries is submerged lands. But there's another point I'd like to make with regard to the establishment of the park. This park was created under the Antiquities Act, and under the Antiquities Act, the President is given authority to create national monuments, but they cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress. Now, Congress could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to give up the land. It could have disestablished some part of it, and it chose not to do so. And yet, that's another indication that Congress was intending to retain these lands. Now, I would like to move on to the other two counts we have here, unless we have further questions about   about Glacier Bay. But I   I think one thing that I do   one thought I want you   to leave you with with regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are essential to the park. They are understood to be essential at the time that the park was created. And the   the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one with regard to this park. Those lands are   continue to be used   the submerged lands for scientific research that is vitally important. Now, I'd like to point out that the master also correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits are historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska failed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test. This Court specifically failed to show a continuous assertion of   of sovereignty to exclude vessels that have   that are visiting the park or passing through in innocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of foreign nations. During the past 150-year period, neither Alaska nor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel based on   merely on innocent passage. Rather, Alaska   Alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we unambiguously did so. The only  \n Alaska is arguing, as I understand it now, that the   the exclusion for purposes of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a matter of international law, which is a point that you disagree on. What   what is your response to their response to  \n The answer is in order to establish a historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage. Fisheries is not   engaging in fishing activity under the convention is not innocent passage. And so, therefore, an exclusion based on fisheries can never   can never give rise to a claim of  \n And what's   what's your best authority for that?\n Well, our best authority is the convention itself. The convention makes clear under article 14 that fisheries is   that fisheries activities are not innocent passage. Rather, innocent passage is merely transit through from one point to another. Moreover, the Marguerite incident that they describe involves a single incident; that is, it does not satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland   the historic inland waters test requires. And finally, it also didn't satisfy the acquiescence test since the British Government protested the seizure of the ship. And finally on top of that, this vessel   we don't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that it was seized. There continues to be a dispute and the master was unable to determine whether that   the ship was in   inside or outside the 3-mile limit. Now, I'd also like to speak briefly to the juridical   juridical bay claim as well. This is a matter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine it would address on rebuttal. The master correctly rejected Alaska's extraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be turned into two large   large juridical bays. And basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland on an island. Now, that does not suffice the purpose of the convention. The only way that it can establish a bay headland or   or closing point is by showing that it's on the mainland. In order to establish that this is on the mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of water. And as the master recognized, these bodies of water are simply too substantial to ignore. In the case of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on average 4 and a half miles wide. It's   simply those intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish that this is   is part of the mainland. It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which is a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for international navigation. That too precludes it from being ignored and treated as dry land. The failure of those two assimilations by itself is sufficient to establish that   that these   that these juridical bays do not exist. And even if that were not enough, the master went on to say that this would not be a well-marked indentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate these lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would not be   the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is passing by. For all those reasons, the juridical bays here are   are simply not well founded, and the master was correct in rejecting them. So what we see  \n Mr. Minear, could I go back to Glacier  \n Certainly, Your Honor.\n   Park again for a moment and ask why the Government decided to base its claim to the lands in Glacier Bay exclusively on that murky provision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards set out in the Idaho case?\n Well, Your Honor  \n Do you   do you not rely on that standard  \n Quite  \n   of analysis?\n Quite honestly we thought that under the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required to create absolutely new   no new law. It had already interpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e) applied to this case. We think the Idaho provisions provide another opportunity for us to establish it. It's quite clear that the purposes of the   the lands here, the submerged lands, are so essential to the park that it's simply inconceivable that Congress would have intended for those lands to pass out of ownership. However, we relied on  \n Would you   would you tell us again why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you still go back before the   the Special Master to show certain facts?\n Well, first of all, Alaska has not moved for summary judgment. We moved for summary judgment on some of our theories. Other theories would require some factual development. One of the theories that we would   we would go forward with is that these lands are occupied under a claim of right, and that's another exception under the Submerged Lands Act. In addition, we would renew the argument with regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an area and authorizes the President to set it aside under the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain those lands.\n Well, given the absence of a summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.\n No. You would not have   we   we believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not think that he foreclosed it. But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's important and worthwhile. We think that this case falls squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in particular we relied on it primarily because it provides an actual textual basis for showing that the   the United States retain those lands. We do not need to go further and show purpose, although we certainly can. We relied on the Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear example of why retention is   is required in this case. The master agreed with us. He analyzed the Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the   the proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent retention clause. There's no other way to understand the Arctic Coast decision except on that basis. And we think that's the right interpretation, and we think if we   if you focus on what the Court said on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear. The statement that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test is an afterthought at the end of the opinion. It's a statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce the conclusion it's already reached. It doesn't provide a basis for   for departing from that. And in fact, as I hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't make any sense, that they're simply   all of those lands that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall within the main clause. The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple purposes. It's   the two wildlife refuges that they point to both the record shows were used for multiple purposes. They were not used solely for conservation purposes. And in addition, they were   to the extent that those refuges adverted to any lands at all   any statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not   not the 1943 statute. Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has no answer for. One   one of those refuges, in particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other areas. It clearly is being used for those purposes. We think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did intend to retain these lands. That was the point that   that this proviso, as Secretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he stated in   the excerpt appears in page   on page 47, note 37 of our brief. He stated that these reservations   the land and water would be reserved. He clearly was aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to reserve both land and water. Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back and look at the big picture here. The United States' position overall results in a very sensible division of submerged lands in this case. We have not contested Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest. Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal Government interests are paramount. First of all, with regard to drawing international   developing international principles to establish baselines, which creates these bays and   and pockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our foreign policy requires. Secondly, where the United States has clearly reserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National Park. This park was set aside for the benefit of the entire Nation. We think that the Court should adopt the master's report in full. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Franklin, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n Thank you, Your Honor. To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact, advocating the principles of that case. It is not sufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation that might include submerged lands. Congress has to take some action to explicitly ratify that. That was what happened in the Idaho case, according to the Court. And the United States has identified one statute and one statute only that it asserts can   ratifies the bay, and that's section 6(e), the proviso. We think the plain language to section (e)   6(e) is dispositive in this case. We are operating here under a clear statement rule. The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended that the submerged lands   title to submerged lands be defeated. There was   the statute says such transfer shall not include. There simply was no need for Congress to have included   to have specified that such transfer, the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged lands when they were not included   or excuse me   shall not include properties that were not included in the first place. That includes Glacier Bay.\n Would   would you respond to the   to the argument that the Alaska Arctic Coast case decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?\n Well, my   my first response is even the master, who ruled   who   who decided against us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60 and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within the proviso. Therefore   excuse me. The main clause. Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held that lands that did not fall within the main clause were included by the proviso. It is important, though, to   to note this, that even if the statute is ambiguous   and we think that it is not   Alaska still prevails here because a   there is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.\n But the   the argument is that it is clear because the reservation without the reservation of the waters would be crazy.\n Well, it  \n Why isn't   I mean, what's   what's the answer?\n We dispute that for the following reason, Your Honor, that   that the   the point of the monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the glaciers as they recede on dry land. Title to the submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose. But I think their sky-is-falling argument really falls apart here. All that the counsel can point to is the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom. There is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would   would prevent scientists who want to study this   these lands from doing that. We let scientists onto all of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they have a good reason for doing it. We hope to work cooperatively with the Federal Government on this. The   the idea that Alaska is somehow going to be less receptive to scientific research here I think demeans our Federal structure. We have a Federal structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands is given to the States because they are viewed as the ones principally affected by the activities that go on there. We are not planning on   on preventing scientists from scuba diving down there. By the way, they did not at the time of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because there   there really wasn't any scuba diving going on. But to   to move on   I see my time is up.\n Thank you, Mr. Franklin. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court: Kansas would like to address three issues today. 50 years of success of the Court's river master on the Delaware River and 16 years of success of the Court's river master on the Pecos River demonstrate the wisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate circumstances on a river like the Arkansas River, which is the subject of this case. Secondly, the Court should affirm the neutral principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages owing at the time interest begins to run. And third, a 1-year compliance period would be consistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and would preserve an essential right of Kansas and its farmers under this   this compact that would otherwise be lost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year accounting period. With respect to this accounting period, I would note that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court has relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, which is the standard for compact compliance in this case. In the first opinion in 1995, this Court distinguished between monthly and   and seasonal use of the model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but that seasonal reliance on the model for determining useability under article IV-D of the compact was reasonable. When the case was back here in 2001, this Court reviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a yearly basis. As you can imagine, the factors that go into calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H I Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently accurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.\n Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm wrong. I   I looked at these papers a while ago. I thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate the   the relevant amounts in the 10th year.\n That is correct, Your Honor. It is a moving accumulation of 10 years of results.\n So they do use 10 years of figures to determine what the relevant year's water would be.\n That's correct, Your Honor. In other words, the   the annual determination includes the most current year for which there is data and the previous 9 years, adds all those up, nets out the pluses and minuses, and that determines whether in the year in question there is compliance with the compact.\n This will begin in 2007, as I recall. Is that  \n That is the special master's proposal, yes.\n And what I don't understand is even   even if we agree with you that it should be done annually, why   why wouldn't you propose that it be done annually using the previous 7 years' experience that we now have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can use the previous 10 years? I   I don't understand why we have to do it year by year and forego even 7 years'benefit of   of this methodology.\n Your Honor, I couldn't agree with you more in the sense that we should begin now with the accounting so that you look each year at the results of this standard, which has been approved by the Court, for compact compliance in that year only, and if   if you accumulate it  \n No. That   that's   I said just the opposite. I said I   I don't know why we should begin looking for this   at this year only using this methodology. Why shouldn't we average this methodology over the previous 7 years?\n Your Honor, averages will tend to smooth out the results and will hide the effects during dry years, which is when the farmers in Kansas, who are the beneficiaries that Kansas intended to benefit   and both parties realize that. They need this water  \n But your method   your method will over-emphasize the dry years. So either way you have a   a imperfect situation. In your case, year by year, and in a dry year, Colorado perhaps must over compensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row, then it's going to be   work out to Colorado's disadvantage.\n Your Honor, I believe the   the result is the   is the opposite. If I may explain. The model, the   the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, has been made as unbiased as possible. The one aspect in which we have identified a bias is that it favors Colorado during dry years. It tends to underestimate the depletions that would have to be replaced by Colorado.\n That's the method that you're attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't it be just the reverse?\n We don't believe that aspect of the model would be any different if we're doing it year by year. We'd simply be taking the results that are calculated each year under either approach and use those in that year so that if you have a dry year, you are   are calculating in that year whether there is compliance and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the compact, which is to provide water when the farmers need it.\n Do you   do you dispute what   what the master found here, that the methodology is more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by year?\n No, Your Honor. The longer the period of time you take, the more the accumulated results of the model will match the measured  \n The actual year-by-year results. Right?\n Yes, and I should point out that it's impossible to know what the right answer is. You can   you can measure the flows and the diversions in the river and compare that to one of the runs of this model, but it's the difference between the two runs, one representing the compact condition, which is supposed to be met, and the other representing the situation with the wells operating. And it's the difference between those two whose accuracy is in question.\n Yes, but I   I  \n And no one knows what that is.\n I understand that   that the master concluded that even as to a particular year, the model will be more accurate if you use the average from the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model to a single year, that even as to the real results for that single year, the model will be more accurate if you use a 10-year average.\n Your Honor, I don't understand it that way. If you use 10 years, you are adding to the most recent year results 9 years of pluses and minuses that's going to, in most case, mask what happened during that next previous year. You will be looking at a 10-year accumulation of ups and downs and not analyzing what happened in   in the year in question.\n Is part or all of the objectives of both the   the decree and the 10-year model to conserve subsurface reservoirs?\n Not   not directly, Your Honor. It   it does preserve that reservoir in fact because depletion of that reservoir affects the stream flows, and it's the stream flows that are compacted here and that have up to now  \n Well, then   well, then why isn't   if   if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado shouldn't get credit for the wet years in   in   on an average? You're concerned about the dry years. It seems to me that Colorado should be given some credit for the wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are   are replenished. Or am I wrong   am I wrong about that?\n I think in general, Your Honor, you are   are correct. The question about there are over deliveries by Colorado, I believe is what you're addressing, is there   is there a way to give Colorado credit for that. And there is a way. There is a   a   an account in John Martin Reservoir, which is 60 miles above the State line, for those deliveries. When they are delivered there, if there is more delivered than is actually needed in that year to achieve compact compliance, that can be retained there and, except for a small effect of evaporation, is available to offset depletions in the following year.\n I   I thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n Well, how does that comport with what you just said?\n Under those circumstances, the water that would be delivered to this offset account in John Martin Reservoir is not a credit that's accounted under the compact for that year. So it would not enter into the compact accounting for that year. It would not constitute a   a credit, but it would be available as a practical matter to be used as a credit in the next year for current depletions. So there would be no carryover in compact accounting.\n I don't   I don't understand that statement. You say it would be available to be used as a credit in a subsequent year. Do you really mean it would be used as a credit, or do you mean it would simply be there to be used?\n I think your formulation, Your Honor, is   is more correct.\n Okay.\n It would be there to be used, and it would not be a credit for accounting purposes. Yes.\n Well, if it's not a credit for accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as much the next year even though   even though you had more water the previous year.\n This is under the assumption, Your Honor, that they have already met their obligations in the current year.\n Yes.\n And it will be available as a practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent year and be accounted in that subsequent year. I would point out that this is very important for Kansas farmers that the   the water be received when it is supposed to be delivered under the compact. If water is   is not delivered, as required, in one year, it cannot be recouped in a following year, certainly not 10 years later, as would be possible under the special master  \n Well, then why are you using a 10-year model at all?\n It's not a 10  \n It seems to me what you're   what you're saying is forget the 10 years. Just do it every year.\n That's what we are saying, Your Honor. And the model is inherently a yearly model. It calculates actually results on a monthly basis, and we have used it   and the Court has relied upon it   on a yearly basis up to now.\n Why don't you do it on a monthly basis? Indeed, why don't you do it on a daily basis? I mean, the master found that this model really works if you   if you stretch it out over 10 years. You say 1 year. Why don't you do it month by month?\n Well, it   it could be done that way, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this same model in its own administration of groundwater pumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of protecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires replacement of water on a monthly basis. So it is   it is possible. But we believe with the yearly accumulation that   that we have relied upon so far in this case and that the Court has relied upon specifically for damages, that that is an appropriate accounting period for this particular purpose. And that is   that is our proposal. The proposal of Colorado is no, let's wait 10 years before   and   and accumulate it with the other 9 years before we require any replacement. I would point out that the H-I Model, the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, is the best tool available for this purpose. It was endorsed by Colorado after the Court's first opinion in this case when it   the Court approved using the model on a seasonal basis for the seasonal accounting of useability. At that time, Colorado gave up its own model in favor of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, and as you can see from the master's report, there have been several significant improvements in the model since that time. I would also point out the correspondence   the close correspondence that exists between this case and the Pecos River litigation in the 1980's. There you had a compact that like this compact did not specify any specific quantity of water in the compact itself, but indicated that there was to be no depletions beyond the depletions that were occurring at the time of the compact with a few small amendments that I could   I could mention. But the basic similarity of the compacts is that the status quo at the time of the compact was maintained. There was an inflow/outflow relationship that needed to be observed and was required to be observed by the compact. It was expressed explicitly in the Pecos River compact by a reference to an inflow/outflow method. In this case, it was expressed implicitly in article IV-D of the compact.\n The master found that the role of the river master in the Pecos case was quite different than the role of the river master you want to have appointed here. He found that the role of the river master in the Pecos cases was really ministerial.\n Your Honor, we do not agree with that.\n You don't agree with what?\n With the description of the Pecos River master as being   as having only ministerial duties, and I can explain why.\n Please do.\n Yes. if   if you refer to the appendix of our   our blue brief, on page A-22, you will see that the opening section of the Pecos River master's manual sets out the inflow/outflow relationship that is to be observed in complying with that compact. This is the form of an equation. You can see y equals and a   and a number there. In   in our case, we have the   the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, which benefits from several decades of increased sophistication in hydrologic analysis to do the same job.\n The Pecos master can simply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results that the compact requires?\n He   he is to apply the formula, Your Honor, but there's a great deal of judgment, professional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised in order to apply it. For example, you have to separate flood flows from base flows. When you look at the   at the results of a   of a gauge on a river, you can see how much water was in the river at particular times, but this has to be separated into two different kinds of flows that are treated differently under this compact.\n Well, one of the reasons I'm curious is that I believe the Pecos master is an engineer. He's not a lawyer.\n That's correct.\n He's also the cheapest master we've ever had. (Laughter.)\n But it seems to me that the master you want appointed has got to be a lawyer and make legal decisions.\n Your Honor, I don't believe so. I think our master would be just as cheap. (Laughter.)\n What's the difference  \n No. The question was what about the  \n What   what relation do you or   yes   working relation do you anticipate, if   if the river master is appointed, between the river master and the commission? Does he go first to the commission and try to get agreement or  \n Your Honor, no, he would not formally interact with the commission, just as the Pecos River master does not formally interact with the Pecos River commission.\n Well, what can   what can the river master do that the   that the commission or authority can't do? I   is the difference between the two of them   call it a jurisdictional difference   nil, but there is process difference in the sense that the river master could say do this or don't do that, whereas your   your fear is that the authority is simply going to be deadlocked because everything has to be done unanimously? Is it a process difference?\n It is a process difference, Your Honor. The  \n But for that, you wouldn't be asking for a river master then.\n Well, if there were an authoritative way, such as a river master, by which the annual recurring exercise of judgment could be accomplished, we would not need the river master. But I don't  \n But aren't you bypassing what Congress set up? You have this interstate compact and this commission, which you're saying, well, it's ineffective because it has to   there are three from each State and it has to do everything unanimously. But what about the commission's authority to call in an   an arbitrator when they are deadlocked?\n That decision also requires unanimity, Your Honor, and in the one case I'm aware of, Kansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by Colorado. It's   but it's   it takes unanimity to do anything under that compact administration, including the arbitration option.\n But you're saying Congress  \n Mr. Draper, could I ask you what is a matter of procedure? What is your understanding of   of how one would go about challenging the river master's decision if one disagreed with it? Do you go to the special master? Do you come direct to this Court?\n Your Honor, we have suggested that it be set up just as you have set up the Pecos River master. In other words, if there were an objection to the determination, the yearly determination, of the river master, it would be reviewable by this Court.\n Directly.\n Directly.\n And the special master would be out. The special master would be out of the picture, as you describe it. You   the special master would be finished. The river master would take over. Has there ever been   has this Court ever appointed a river master when the special master did not recommend it? And as I understand both Delaware and the Pecos River case, the special master recommended the appointment of a river master.\n Your Honor, I believe in both of those cases, the   the special master was recommending the appointment of a river master, but I would point out that in setting out the criteria for appointing a river master, the Court did not refer to that factor as   as being part of the consideration.\n As I understand the system you propose, the river master's decision would be appealable to us, and we would review it de novo. Is that right?\n We're suggesting the same scope of review as on the Pecos, which is clearly erroneous. This, however, is something that the Court could decide to do differently than the Pecos, but the clearly erroneous standard comports with the   the way master recommendations are handled in the district court under rule 53.\n I'm very loathe to deprive either of the States of their   their right to have this Court decide matters between them.\n Your Honor, this would not deprive either State of that right. And in fact  \n Well, it would if they can only come here and   and overturn the river master if he's clearly erroneous. That's a   that's a very high standard.\n Well, there   as I say, the Court   the Court may set the review threshold as it sees fit.\n I   I had thought that your proposal was de novo review. This is   this is new to me, that   that you want it clearly erroneous.\n Your Honor, I would   I would say that we have   we have mentioned the clearly erroneous review standard because it was in the Pecos framework. It is not essential to our proposal. A de novo review would be perfectly fine with the State of Kansas.\n Suppose the commission decided to appoint an arbitrator. Would the special   pardon me. Would the river master then proceed independently and we'd have two different recommendations?\n As under the Pecos, Your Honor, if the   if the compact administration, as it's called in the   in the Arkansas Basin, is able to come to a resolution of an issue, then that would   that would take care of that issue. It would be   not be necessary to have the river master address that, and it would be an agreement of the States because it would either be an agreement because they had literally agreed before the   or in the form of the Arkansas River Compact Administration or that they had agreed to binding arbitration and had settled it.\n Well, then it would seem to me, procedurally at least, the river master would have if not the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer things first to the commission.\n Your Honor, the referral of matters to the commission is why we're here in the first place. It cannot act without unanimity. The State of Colorado, the State in possession of this resource, can veto each and every action of the compact administration.\n That was the deal.\n Your   yes. Your State agreed to it.\n That was the deal they came to. Why should we kick it over? They came to that arrangement, and it was approved by Congress, and now you come back and tell us, oh, this is too cumbersome. You should   you should appoint this river master to do an end run around it. I   I   it doesn't seem to me to be fair.\n Your Honor, I don't believe that this is an end run any more than the enforcement of the compact is an end run around the administrative body that is set up in many of these compacts. Those are keep-in-touch type bodies. If they can agree on things, they are very useful, and the Arkansas River Compact Administration has been useful in areas where there can be agreement.\n No, but you   you agree that this is the   the authority here is more than a keep-in-touch group. Your problem with it is   is not that you need something more than keep in touch, but that when you ask them to do something more than keep in touch, the other State has a veto. And   and that simply gets you to Justice Scalia's objection. That's the deal you made.\n That is the   that is the nub of our argument against reliance on the Arkansas River Compact Administration, that you can't look at it to settle differences about the implementation of this Court's decree.\n What did the special  \n That is a  \n What did the special master mean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote problem, but he said, but the climate may be changing? The compact administration under the chairmanship of the United States representative may again be seen as the best way to administer their compact and settle issues. What was he talking about?\n Your Honor, I think he was talking about the hope that he has that the States could work more cooperatively now, despite the fact that it was on this river between these two States that this Court was first asked to resolve interstate river disputes between States in 1901, and we are here today still in dispute over this river.\n So there was nothing tangible behind his  \n Nothing tangible, Your Honor. We   perhaps he was thinking of the settlement that we have achieved on the Republican River. That case started, was accepted by this Court. After rulings by this Court, it became possible to settle that case. It has now been settled. And the States involved in that litigation were Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. It was possible in that   in that context. It has proven impossible in this context. And we can expect disputes to go on, as they have over the last century, if we do not have an impartial expert authority to resolve disputes between States that are going to come up every year. Every year there are questions. How do you take the data this year and put it into the H-I Model? While many of those issues have been settled, because different forms of replacement and other different circumstances arise, you have those every year. And if you follow the lead that the Pecos River cases of this Court give us, there is also the possibility to address the improvement of the tool for implementing the agreement of the States, and that is improving the Hydrologic-Institutional Model on occasion, as we have seen the master do over the course of this litigation. That is allowed under the Pecos River Decree, and we submit that it should be allowed under this decree as well. And that is when the master would be exercising the most judgment in our opinion. I would conclude by saying that a   a river master is needed on the Arkansas to deal impartially and expertly with annual questions that must be resolved to implement the H-I Model, and that a 1-year compliance period will implement the intentions of the drafters of the compact and the needs of Kansas farmers and is consistent with the yearly reliance that this Court has already placed on the H-I Model. I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if there are no further questions.\n Very well, Mr. Draper. Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I will begin by discussing the river master since that's where Mr. Draper left off. I want to make it clear, first of all, that I disagree with the assertion that the Pecos River Compact and the Arkansas River Compact are similar in the way they operate. The Pecos River Compact did, in fact, specifically state that it was   it intended to hold the level of   of depletion of the system by man's development to the 1947 condition. The Arkansas River Compact, to the contrary, begins the   the limitation clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas Basin, provided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use for the uses. So the   the Arkansas compact contemplated that there would be a   a more flexible effort at using the water of the river by water users in both States, protecting the existing uses in both States from that future development. Now, this   this Court has appointed a river master in two circumstances. In both circumstances, as pointed out by Justice Ginsburg, the   the special master recommended that because of the specific circumstances of the case, that in fact a river master was appropriate. That was on the Delaware River and the Pecos River. In all other cases that deal with this issue where requests have been made by   by States without river   without a special master's recommendation, the Court has declined to appoint a river master. There's a very good reason, I think, behind that. Colorado alone is the party denying interstate compacts in two equitable apportionment decrees. If every time a State is dissatisfied with its neighbor, is dissatisfied with how a compact operates, it is able to come to this Court and say, please appoint a river master, we're just having trouble with our neighbor, you'll become the water management   the super water management agency for the country. You have river masters if you   it's totally up to   to your discretion. But if you were to follow this line of thinking, you end up supervising water distribution across the west and part of the east.\n Well, the disputes are going to come up here eventually anyway if the States are intransigent. Ultimately it will be a dispute about the application of the compact and it will come back here anyway, won't it?\n Justice Scalia, that is absolutely correct, but the difference is where compacts have mechanisms within them that are designed to work out these differences, I think it is in the Court's interest   and Colorado's position is and the special master's position was it was in the Court's interest   to refer these matters back to those compact administrations. You  \n Counsel, do you think it's any more likely today than in the past that the two States will be able to work out their continued disagreements?\n Justice O'Connor, I agree completely with the special master. The State of Colorado has proposed, as referred to in his ruling, that binding arbitration be used and has committed itself to participate in that. To the extent there   there have been past conflicts, Colorado has said let's get them behind us. Let's return to the compact, congressionally sanctioned method for resolving our differences, and let's proceed down the road. We will  \n But   but Colorado still has the veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will be appointed. Is that right?\n That is   under the compact, that's correct.\n Yes, yes.\n And so   but   but Colorado has made a   a very clear commitment to the special master and does so to this Court that if arbitration is proposed, Colorado would participate. We do not as a State find it very acceptable to spend the time, money, and effort to litigate these issues. After all, we have farmers. Kansas has farmers. We need to get back to getting the water equitably resolved through the compact mechanism. That is our proposal. It was  \n So is it right then that   let's imagine the special river master's name is Mr. Smith, and unlike me, he knows about this stuff. And he then   you   Kansas wants Mr. Smith to decide a certain number of issues. Call them issues on page 1, whatever they are. And as far as you're concerned, your client would say I'm happy to have Mr. Smith. Just don't call him a river master. Call him an arbitrator. So you're saying that when Kansas says they would do it except there's a problem of getting unanimity, you say the only problem is that you won't agree.\n At the present time, that's the posture  \n Now, they're the obstacle to unanimity. So the keys are in their own pocket if they want Mr. Smith. That's your view.\n Our view is if they want to arbitrate pursuant to the compact, the keys are in their   in their pocket. We do not believe  \n So the problem can't be one of unanimity because your side agrees. I mean, you heard what he said. So I'm   I'm trying to see  \n Our side agrees, Your   Justice Breyer, with   with the concept that this matter should be returned to the compact administration to resolve the differences in that forum.\n And   and in that forum, you will agree to binding arbitration.\n In that forum, we will agree to binding arbitration.\n Binding arbitration will   will mercifully keep this stuff off of our desk, won't it?\n Yes, it will. (Laughter.)\n I want   I want to make it very clear to the Court that the State of Colorado, different than the situation in the Pecos River, acted very aggressively to ensure that it promptly came into compliance with the   with the determination that in fact depletions were occurring, impermissible depletions were occurring to the Arkansas River. Within 2 years, the State of Colorado's legislature had passed the appropriate legislation. The State engineer had passed rules and regulations, implemented them, and enforced them. The State had authorized millions of dollars in loans for the acquisition of replacement water, and   and the State of Colorado   your   your ruling was in 1995. By 1997, it appears that the State of Colorado was in compliance with the compact. That is a significant and very difficult effort on the part of the legislature, the Governor, the attorney general, and the State engineer. We do not believe that this is anything like the Pecos River. Your master in this case has not said to you these parties are   are torn, will not get together, and you need to have a master, a river master, appointed. In this instance, the State of Colorado took the exact opposite approach. They did everything they could to reduce the pumping of the wells sufficiently to allow Colorado to meet the terms of the compact, and that is an important fact you need to glean from the special master's report. Now, the   the other   the only other point I want to make on this is that the   the   it's   it's very important, in deciding whether or not a river master is the appropriate course of action to determine   and I   I mentioned this earlier   whether or not the Court wants to be in a supervisory position. I happen to agree that the States are entitled to seek redress of their concerns before this Court, and as you said in   in Oklahoma v. New Mexico, you have a serious obligation to adjudicate disputes between the States where there are actual and existing controversies. And   and the fact that you would have a river master would not eliminate the potential for those controversies. In our view, the only way that you can get this matter off of your plate and into the position that Congress recognized and   and directed is to follow the special master's recommendation number 12. I'd now like to turn, if I may, to the issue of the accuracy of the model.\n May I ask you a question, because you may not bother to talk about it otherwise, about punitive damages? Your opponent didn't seem to think it very important, but I have this question. Is it your view that the other State waived its claim to the punitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it today or by submitting the different set of figures at the time the   the issue was before the master the last time around?\n Justice Stevens, in response to your question, we believe that in fact the issue of prejudgment interest, or punitive damages, is law of the case in this matter. The special master set out a formula by which he proposed how the damages should be calculated. Kansas argued for actual value of money, a rather rigid theory of compensation, and the special master chose in fact a balancing of the equities approach. He suggested that the appropriate means to calculate those   that prejudgment interest on the   the nominal damages  \n Did he   did he make that suggestion or did the other   did Kansas make that suggestion?\n The special master ruled on how he believed the damages should be calculated.\n In this time around or in the preceding  \n In the preceding time around. And what he said was that the damages from 1950 to 1968 should be   should   should receive a inflationary increase to reflect the inflationary tendencies, but that they should not be dealt with under prejudgment interest. In other words, it shouldn't be compounded through prejudgment interest. Only the damages from 1969 forward should be compounded using prejudgment interest. Kansas did not except to that methodology. Kansas excepted to the fact that he didn't give them prejudgment interest on the damages from 1950 forward. In the opinion that you authored for the Court, you accepted the master's methodology, and you did one thing and only one.\n Well, the master's methodology really wasn't at issue.\n The master's  \n The only issue before us, as I remember it, was the date from which the prejudgment interest would run.\n That's  \n That's   that's all that was argued. And it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed sum rather than an   a changing amount as years went by, that clearly we would have   the interest would have run on the existing liability. But it's an unusual case because the damages are changing as time goes by.\n It is and I agree with you, Justice Stevens. It is an unusual case. But the   the critical element here is that the master was looking for an equitable way to arrive at a damage sum.\n Well, except that, as I read his report, he was simply interpreting our opinion, best he could, on the second go-round.\n This   this go-round?\n Yes.\n That's correct, Justice Kennedy.\n And   and I think that's what's before us here. It   it seems to me that your best argument for no interest post '85 on the pre-'85 damages is to say, well, it's uncertain, it's hard to compute, but that doesn't quite work because this Court   and of course, the special master   allowed damages   the interest on post-'85 damages even though those are equally difficult to compute.\n It isn't the   if I may, Justice Kennedy, it isn't the  \n So I'm   I'm saying it seems to me that's your best argument, but there's a flaw in there.\n38 million. By moving the year forward from 1969 to 1985, you automatically then reduce, by some degree, the amount of that damage calculation.\n No, but did we   your   your view is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that past damage.\n Prejudgment  \n Pre-1985.\n The   the special master's methodology, Justice Stevens, was that the damages in his third report from 1950 to 1968 should not, under a balancing of the equities, bear prejudgment interest at any point in time. They should only be advanced for inflation, which was a proposal Colorado made because Colorado believed that it   the changing a 1950 damage to a   to a 2002, or at that time a 1994, dollar value was only fair and reasonable. We opposed the concept of giving prejudgment interest because it would   it would be   it's as if   if this were a commercial context, we would have been able to identify that there was a damage going on and the theory in your prejudgment cases is we could have put the money in the bank  \n But we rejected that as to post-'85 damages.\n You agreed that prejudgment interest, Justice Kennedy, should be applied to post-'85 damages, not to pre-'85 damages.\n Well, but our opinion didn't say it was just post-'85 damages. Our   our opinion didn't   didn't answer the question, and   and the reason, of course, is we didn't actually think about it because nobody even   nobody argued it at that time.\n Our view was that   that   our view is, Justice Stevens, that an exception needed to be taken if the master's methodology was under challenge.\n So in a way you really are arguing waiver I think.\n We are arguing law of the case. Yes, we are.\n Which is consistent with his failure to argue it today.\n That's   that is our position, Your Honor. I would like to, if   if I may, move off of prejudgment interest. I would like to talk, while I still have a few minutes, a little bit about this model and the 10-year average.\n Can you give   I'm   I'm not sure I understand the dispute. Can you give me in   in   without using up all of your time, a   basically a simple example to illustrate the difference between the two contending methodological positions?\n Yes, I can, Justice Souter. Under the   the master's formulation, which is agreed to by Colorado, the damages which occur in each year, 1950 through 1984, are   are computed at   in   as nominal damages in the year in which they occur. They are then expanded by the   by an inflationary formula which allows the dollar in 1950 to be calculated in a 2002 dollar. In 1985 and to the present, any damages that occur are advanced both for inflation, but then they are also awarded a prejudgment interest, which is compounded. In other words, if inflation is 2 or 3 percent through the period on a long-term average, but   but investments are at 6 or 7 percent  \n I got you.\n20-some million in the proposition, which we don't believe is what the Court intended. Let me   let me turn very quickly to the model, if I may. The   the issue here is not Colorado's obligation to deliver water to   to the river system. Colorado has both senior surface water rights and the State of Kansas that it has obligations to protect. Remember, the compact envisions that this subsequent development can't injure water users in either Kansas or Colorado. As a result, Colorado must ensure that on a monthly basis, water is placed into the river so depletions are   are compensated for in the system as they occur. The problem here is not that process. The problem here is a model that is inaccurate. Beginning in your first report, you quoted with favor the special master's comments about this model in dealing with the winter water storage program, which was an issue which you agreed should be dismissed several years ago. You indicated that depletions shown were well within the range of error and it could not be told if it was an impact or an error that the model was describing.\n Counsel, your time is running short. This is very important. I think you misunderstood Justice Souter's question. He asked you to give us an example of the Kansas versus Colorado approach as to the 10-year model. You answered him about the interest. Could you  \n I'm so sorry.\n   could you tell us really  \n Yes.\n Give us an example of the difference between the two.\n Yes. The difference between the two is this. We believe that the model over a long period of time, as it's developer, Mr. Durbin, said, is reasonably accurate. We   we agree with that, and we are willing to use it like that. But that means you have to use   look at it over extended periods of time. Our view is that you simply look at the model, which is predicting over-deliveries and under-deliveries, predicting them. They don't have any relationship to what Colorado is really putting into the system. They are predictions. And in some years where you   where you look back and you know from the gauges the model is over-predicting a significant amount, you   you want to be   and you know in a subsequent year it's going to under-predict, you want to allow that to smooth out so that you are, in fact, getting close to what's really going on. It is not an effort to carry dry-year depletions into wet years or vice versa. It is, in fact, an effort to allow the model's inherent inaccuracies to play out so that you get a more accurate result in each 10th year.\n Why doesn't   why isn't the result that you   of   of your position that you would get a more accurate set of predictions if all you were making was a 10-year calculation, but you will not get a more accurate set of predictions with respect to any one year? And in fact, it is with respect to any one year that's important under the compact. In other words, they   they plan every year, not every 10 years. So why does a 10-year accuracy help you in solving the practical problem you have on a year-to-year basis?\n As proposed by the special master, the model is not used every 10 year   or every 10th year. It's used every year. If you're looking at  \n I know. But it's used on the basis of 10-year figures which will not be accurate particularly with respect to any given year even though they would be   they would be accurate if you were only interested in a calculation every 10 years.\n You are making  \n Does it   can   can you   can you get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis is what I'm saying.\n You get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis. A   a better prediction if you're looking at the model over 10 years versus looking at the model just running it in a given year. Colorado does not want to be in a position, Justice Souter, where we are accused of violating the compact because there is an inaccuracy in the tool that is being used.\n Thank you  \n It  \n Thank you, Mr. Robbins.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's the position of the United States that   that we agree with Colorado and with the special master that a river master should not be appointed in this case. The compact between the States of Kansas and Colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for implementing the obligations in that compact, which has to do with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount of water to Kansas. The commission is also charged with investigating violations of the compact, and the compact includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to binding arbitration if the   the States agree to that. The   the commission also certainly could use other dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the authority to do if it wanted to. The States have agreed to that. Congress has enacted it into law, and this Court should permit the parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that might arise in the future rather than putting a river master in place under the authority of this Court. Now, the Court has   itself has frequently stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort is preferable to litigation. As the special master pointed out, in the two river basins just north of the Arkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River, the parties recently, after having a dispute, including these very same two States in one of them, have come to a consensual resolution of the dispute that they had. And I think that does show, as the special master pointed out, that these   the States can   in fact, the disputes in those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect of well pumping, among other things. As the special master pointed out, I think that shows that the States can use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and this Court ought to continue its often-stated preference for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to problems of this sort. If the Court were to appoint a river master in this case, then I think the question would arise in any future case in which you have two States that have conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity, as what happened with river compacts, equitable apportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an inherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree or judgment. And I think rather than   that   that would be directly contrary to the Court's other statement in the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and that it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions, but also that the Court does not favor appointing agents or functionaries to carry out its decrees.\n So I guess we made a mistake with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other one? Delaware?\n Yes. The Pecos River   I mean, there were a couple of differences, in addition to the ones that Mr. Robbins pointed out. One difference is that not only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos River case   neither party objected to the appointment of a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of clothing the master with authority to make determinations that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous standard. In this case, there is a party that objects to it. And I would   I think there's another difference that's important that the Court ought to keep in mind. At the time the Pecos River master was appointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which the Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide for this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and the Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the   it provided that the river master in that case would be reviewed under that standard. As of 2003, rule 53   it's now rule 53(g)   provides that masters appointed by district courts said their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo standard unless the parties agree otherwise. Therefore, at the present time   and again, following the Court's rule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be guides   and I think they are a useful guide   the appropriate course here, if the Court were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one whose findings will be reviewable de novo. But that itself raises problems because if the findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's really just a continuation of the current litigation and it doesn't really advance things any. The parties will submit the evidence to the river master. He'll make his determinations, and then they'll come to the Court. That's really more what the special master does at the current time. So I think that under all of those circumstances, both the Court's preference for a consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the Court's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to decide cases of this sort and it can't   it's not the obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission that Congress has put into place specifically to deal with this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute resolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a river master in this case. As far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's the position of the United States also that the special master and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest should not be awarded. I think it's a familiar principle in   to this Court in litigation that if a party   when the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all of its objections if it wants the Court to hear them. In this case, the special master came up with a recommendation in his third report about how to   what should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the early years   the   the amount of the damages in those early years would never be subject to prejudgment interest. Now, Kansas objected to that and said we should move the year back to 1950. We should get prejudgment interest on everything back to year one. But they never made the objection that if you   if the Court disagrees with that, which it did, that the method that the master had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969 was incorrect. That was the time that Kansas should have brought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.\n So you're arguing they've waived the   your argument is they waived the objection basically.\n Yes. I think  \n I don't think you used the word waiver in your brief, and I don't think that Colorado did either. But I guess that's the essence of your argument.\n I   I actually think it's a combination of two things. On the one hand, what the Court actually said in its opinion was that the special master had awarded damages only insofar as necessary to satisfy the demands of equity, something to that effect.\n Would you not agree that if it was a one-shot injury, not an ongoing injury, that the normal reading would be the injury   the interest should run on the laws?\n I think in the normal contract case that doesn't have the kinds of equities that this case had, that is the current rule, that prejudgment interest would run. But this kind of case involves damages that go back 50-odd years. It could have been  \n And it involves continuing, ongoing  \n And they're   they're ongoing that are different in amount in every year, that it's not merely that Colorado was violating the compact as of 1950, although it probably didn't know it at that time, but that Kansas didn't bring a suit until 1985 and the fact, I think, that Colorado has always agreed to pay   to adjust the damages for inflation. So, in essence, Kansas is getting a portion of what the prejudgment interest would normally cover for those early years. I think if all that's put together, I think the Court's conclusion that the master's conclusion was just the amount that equity dictates was correct, and that if Kansas didn't like that, it should  \n Mr. Feldman, the Government takes no position on this 1-year versus 10-year computation?\n No, the Government doesn't have a position on that.\n Too hard for you? (Laughter.)\n That issue involves the particularities of this case and the Government doesn't really have a particular interest in how that gets resolved. If there's no further questions, that concludes the argument.\n Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Draper, you have 2 minutes remaining.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to state that we do not believe that we waived our position on the interest calculation as was just suggested in the   in the last colloquy. The reason that we didn't do that is because we filed an exception last time against every respect in which the special master was not recommending full interest. And it turned out that the Court chose the   the test that we now have, which is a relatively easy test to apply. It has certain incentives that grow out of it that make sense. And we believe that we sufficiently excepted to that. If look at our brief from that exception, the one in   in support of our exceptions, in particular   particularly to page 25, footnote 8, we specifically addressed the issue that the   the master was not allowing any interest in that 1950 through 1968 period.\n You're talking about the brief in the earlier case.\n In the earlier case, to the third report of the special master. I would   also, on the other points that were raised, you need to be  \n This is a lot of money involved, and   and you certainly didn't argue it here. I don't recall that point being argued. And with all that money being involved, I would have thought it would have been argued.\n Well, we were   we were arguing the larger issues on interest, but we were asking that interest not be denied to us during that '50 through 1968 period. That was very clear from our briefs, and we specifically singled out that part of it in that footnote. So I don't believe it's appropriate that   to conclude that we have waived that argument. And I would point out also that the only reason that it was done that way   and the calculations of the parties did   did in connection with that review   is because the special master required it. There is no other reason that we did it. We did not volunteer to do it that way. We did not like doing it that way. The master said that's the way it's going to be in my recommendation. How much would that amount to? We did not agree in any way to that part of the calculation. I would also point out that with respect to the amounts involved, that you need to be careful. The amounts cited by Mr. Robbins are not from the same year.\n Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Draper.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n The case is submitted.\n", "arguments in case 06-480, Leegin Creative Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated ": " Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Because title to lands underlying navigable waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty, this Court has long held that there is a strong presumption that each State receives title to such lands at statehood. Under the Court's precedents, the United States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise made that intention very plain. Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case, the United States asserts that it received title to the submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title. To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the United States identifies as ratifying the purported reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains with Alaska. Under the plain language of the statute, the proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause. And this is important. In this case it is undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included within the main clause. The submerged lands, therefore, did not  \n Well, counsel, you   apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section 5  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n   of the statehood act.\n Absolutely.\n And why was Federal title to the monument not sufficient to retain title to the submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e) at all?\n Because of section 6(m), Your Honor. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides that the Federal Government retained all of the property it previously possessed with one important exception, except as provided in section 6. Section 6 has two exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here. Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the States. Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different set of properties. What section 6(e) did was to transfer to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of property, property that was used for the purposes or solely   for the sole purpose of   of fish and wildlife conservation under three designated statutes. Those are the State   local-State fish and wildlife conservation statutes. Again, here it was   it is undisputed that Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause. Therefore, the  \n   problem, as   you just said that   that the main clause is very, very narrow, and we're told by the Government that no wildlife reservation would come within that main clause, so that there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.\n The Government is incorrect, Your Honor. We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the proviso. And here's why the United States is correct on that. They argue in their brief that those properties were not included in the main clause because they were created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the Alaska Game Law of 1943. In fact, Your Honors, those are the exact same statute. The '43 Alaska Game Law simply restated the 1925 law with certain amendments. What that means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the then-existing version. These refuges were created in 1941 prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. So those are two properties. And   and actually the legislative history   we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative history because the statute is plain and also because there's a clear statement rule. But the legislative history does indicate that Congress was specifically concerned about those two very large refuges. The Kenai and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut. And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern of the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not be able adequately to manage those properties. But there was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at issue here because it was never going to be transferred to the State under the main clause.\n Why   why shouldn't we look to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?\n We are advocating the tests set out in the Idaho case, Your Honor. That test is a two-pronged test.\n Right.\n First, you have to look and see if there is a  \n Whether Congress has notice of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation, which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?\n That's   that's relevant to the first prong, Your Honor. The second prong  \n And second, whether the transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that reservation. Should we look to that?\n If the Court were examining the   the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors might be relevant. Here, though, the test is set out in not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress. And Idaho applies that. Idaho looked very carefully for some action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that case. Here, we need an action by Congress. The United States has identified what they contend is the action of Congress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act. That proviso, though, just does not cover these lands.\n Why do you say explicit? I   I thought it said you have to make it plain, which really might matter.\n In  \n What it says   the language I think is   or definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.\n Yes. In the  \n Is that right? There's nothing that says explicit. Right?\n Well, Your Honor, in the Alaska case   and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997 Alaska case. There the Court said that Congress must, quote, explicitly recognize or that Congress had explicitly recognized the resignation in that case. So the   the Court  \n But doesn't that simply mean that if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.\n Yes.\n But it doesn't mean that it must be explicit in every case. Isn't that correct?\n Well, I   I think explicit  \n You don't have to be explicit to make it plain. It's a great way to do it, but that's   it's not the only way.\n It has to be definitely   Justice Breyer, you're correct. It has to be  \n All right.\n   definitely clear or otherwise made plain. Yes.\n If I'm correct, then   if I'm correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here we have a national park and we want to keep the national parks as the United States, which you'd expect. It's a national park. And of course, they want to keep the whole thing. I mean, it's obvious. You don't have to write everything that's obvious. They no more want to give all the water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give the gamekeeper's part to Alaska. A house, or maybe there's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention either, but it's just obvious that unless there's something very special about the water, that the water in the park is part of the park.\n Well, there is something special about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has recognized. The water is a State   an essential attribute of State sovereignty, and just to  \n I understand that. But I mean, it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're giving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's even underground water. But I mean, what the argument I think is   would be is this like that, and the argument that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need this water in order to study the glaciers because there are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora and fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's good enough. Now, what's your reply?\n First of all, the geysers are not included because we're talking about navigable  \n I understand that. I'm using a funny example to  \n Yes. Navigable waters. (Laughter.)\n But let me   let me just assure the Court. There is nothing at all unusual about State-owned submerged lands within national monuments. The reason is simple. The Antiquities Act, which allows the President to designate national monuments, was enacted in 1906. At that time there were 45 States already in the Union. Therefore, any national monument created in those 45 States would necessarily have included State-owned submerged lands unless there had been some conveyance. And let   let me give Your Honors a   a concrete example. In the 1978 California decision decided by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national monument off the coast of California, included State-owned submerged lands because even though the reservation order was asserted to have included those lands, there was no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the State's title. Another  \n Like in Yellowstone. There is a river I think. Who owns that?\n Well, Yellowstone was created before the State of Wyoming and  \n No. But I mean, does the State or the Feds own the   the river that goes through it?\n One would need to examine the particular reservations and statutes there.\n What about in Yosemite? I think there's a river down there too. Is the river in Yosemite owned by California or by the   the Feds?\n I'm not familiar with that, but I will give you an example that I am familiar with.\n Before you do that, Mr. Franklin, is   is the rule that   that we're operating under that Congress had to have made it clear  \n Yes.\n   that it reserved, or is the rule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved it?\n No. It's the former rule, Your Honor.\n It's the former.\n Yes.\n So the mere fact that it doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n Right, but normally you assume, I guess, that Congress does what is   tries to avoid things that are ridiculous. So if they say keep the park, I guess the question would be is that included. I mean  \n It's not  \n   can you read it this way? I   I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?\n Well, first of all, this is not the ordinary   in this case we presumed the   the opposite. In fact, there's a strong presumption. But let me give you the other example that I was going to refer to you.\n Yes.\n There's something called the California Coastal National Monument. That extends the entire length of California and goes out 12 miles to sea. In that monument, the   the lands, the submerged lands, are both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they are managed cooperatively. And that's what we are seeking to do here. And importantly, the fact  \n Mr. Franklin, are   are these submerged lands covered by navigable waters?\n Yes.\n What is it that the Government could do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want to do, that they cannot do simply by   by reason of   of having jurisdiction over the navigable waters?\n There are a few things, presumably very localized activities that the State would have the exclusive authority in. Importantly though, the Federal Government, even though the State owns title here, will retain all of its constitutional authority under the Interstate Commerce Clause to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce that  \n Yes, but just as a practical matter, tell us what you're arguing about. What does Alaska think it can do if it prevails in the Glacier Monument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical matter?\n As   as a practical matter, there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing that are important to the State. There are issues relating to local uses of the bay. But more importantly  \n Well, could   could you be concrete? I mean, there   I don't know what you mean. What are the issues? Can you give me an explicit example?\n Well, one explicit example is I think the State would prefer to have more local subsistence fishing in the bay. And the Court   to   to move out a bit, the  \n So the State would permit more fishing than the U.S. would allow  \n I think  \n   as a practical matter.\n As a practical matter. And   and there   there  \n But couldn't Congress forbid that under   by reason of its control of the navigable waters  \n Well, if  \n   if it really wanted to?\n If Congress really wanted to, Congress could   could affect activities relating to interstate commerce. But importantly, what Alaska seeks here really is a seat at the table. Right now Alaska has no say over anything that happens in its navigable waters which are its sovereign State lands. What it seeks really is to have its views being considered. Right now   and I'll give you a concrete example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the   in the next count that I'll discuss. For some time cruise ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside   or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of Federal laws. That was fixed, but it took an act of Congress to do that. There had to be an act of Congress to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge out in these, what they used to call, donut holes. Alaska finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress every time something comes up on its navigable waters that it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with. Now, if Congress decides to preempt the State under its interstate commerce power, it has the right to do that. I think we also need to keep in mind what waters we're talking about. This is southeast Alaska. The waters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the region. They are central to the economy, the history, the society, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live there and who travel there. Just to take an example, there are still today very few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the   the towns and the cities like the   the State capital of Juneau historically were accessible only by the water. This is an area   the water in particular is an area that is of great importance to Alaska. And they are seeking to confirm that that area does belong to Alaska. And I think we have set forth in quite detail why  \n Well, there   there are big differences between the   the analysis concerning the bays that you assert and Glacier Monument. I think they're quite different.\n Well, the   the tests are different. The Glacier Bay test involves   needs to have an explicit reservation   explicit ratification by Congress of a reservation and  \n You're lumping them all together, but I think the tests are quite different.\n The tests are different. What I was trying to explain is, in answer to Your Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska. It matters quite a deal.\n But in   in respect to Glacier Bay  \n Yes.\n   I   I mean, is the only   you said, for example   is the only dispute about the use of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?\n There are two issues. I think it's fishing and also to allow more local people to visit the area that would otherwise be prohibited by the Park Service. There was   but just to assure Your Honors  \n How could they do that? You mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water there, but they couldn't get off the boat?\n Well, that's normally what   what people do is they just visit the  \n I see.\n   by boats. But to assure Your Honor, there   for example, there are no mineral interests here anywhere in the picture.\n All right. So if   if the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat and to go up along the waterway and to look at the glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska, for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left of the park. I mean, it would be like   you see, if it's essential to it.\n Well, that's not true, Your Honor. 80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it included the submerged lands, is uplands. But it's no more unusual  \n No. I understand that, but I mean, it's the way of visiting the park.\n Yes, but I just mentioned, for example, the two monuments in California. The Channel Islands National Monument this Court held included the   the submerged lands were State-owned. There's no other way to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse State-owned submerged lands. In fact, I think there are few national parks in this country you can't get to without going across State lands. I think there's another important point here and that is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also allow the Federal Government to regulate activities on lands that abut national parks to the extent that they might affect park activities. But here what we need is an expressed statement by Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay. Without that, Your Honors   and the   the precedents are clear. Without that, the presumption is   in fact, the strong presumption is   that these are State-owned lands. And again, there is absolutely nothing unusual. That is part of our Federal system. It's the way that these monument properties have been managed since 1906 when the President first got the authority. It's the way that Glacier Bay will continue to be managed. We expect, we intend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government to resolve any issues that might remain. What we're seeking here, again, is a seat at the table. We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealt with because they are the owner.\n In the   in the '97 case, was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)? Because this  \n Yes. The   the Court expressly stated that it was at pages 60 to 61, and that was in the absence of any contrary argument.\n It   it made an assumption.\n The Court made an assumption, but in fact  \n But was it in fact?\n I think there would have been a substantial   had that   had that issue been litigated, there would have been a substantial argument that it was not within the main clause. But again, there was no argument on that point before the Court. The Court at pages 60 to 61 expressly stated   again, it was an assumption, but the Court expressly stated that the lands were within the main clause. Apparently the Court was considering the fact that the application for ANWR did, in fact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the main clause, the Alaska Game Law. The important point of that case for this case, though, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here, namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal Government a subset of the properties that would otherwise have been transferred to the State under the main clause. There simply was no need for Congress to have expressed an intent  \n I thought we had left that open. I thought we  \n I think what I said is that the Court embraced that position, and it was actually an essential attribute of the   essential premise for the Court's holding. At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the   the decision, what the Court made clear is it was concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso, all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was covered by the proviso. No such concern is present here. I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I might, to the count I, which is the historic waters count. There the United States asserts that at statehood the waters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated enclaves of international high seas that were wholly surrounded by U.S. territorial waters. The historical record, though, belies that contention. At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States took what this Court has described in the Mississippi Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as the publicly stated policy that the waters of the archipelago were inland and that the political boundary ran along the outside edge. Thereafter, the United States took   consistently based a discriminatory enforcement regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. What I mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.\n Well, the argument on the other side, as I understand it, is that the   the assertion of authority to regulate fishing really is   is relevant. It has no necessary implication for the historic waters doctrine. What   what is your answer to that?\n That's the assertion. My answer is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975 decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202, and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief. What the Court said there is it examined an incident in which a Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general area, and the Court said   and I quote   that incident deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and, quote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the waters in question.\n What   what page was that?\n I'm sorry. That's 201 to 202   201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of the blue brief. What the law was at statehood is that the United States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign vessels. Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that is that the law has changed. The law has changed since 1971. Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a 200-mile   what's known as an exclusive economic zone that allows the United States to enforce discriminatory fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that. But   and we have quoted a UN study. In fact, the UN study that we have quoted   and that is noted at page 29 of the blue brief. That is the study that's called the Juridical Regime Study. It's the study that this Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases, has used as the authoritative statement of the law. That study quite clearly states that if a   if a country enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign vessels outside   that that manifests an assertion of an historic inland waters claim. And what we have here  \n On   on this point, it seems to me there   unlike the first point you were discussing where I think the Federal Government can work its will anyway, on this point there is really a significant Federal interest involved. That is to say, if the United States takes the position that these are, indeed, inland waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.\n No. Your Honor, they assert that, but they don't provide any specific examples. And the reason they can't provide a specific example of any instance abroad where it would affect their position is that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own facts. The fact that something is an archipelago does not render it historic waters.\n But   but you say a determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply   is simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.\n It is a claim to the   to the waters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with discriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other statements in this case, including the California brief to this Court. There has to be an   excuse me   an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before one can conclude that waters are historic waters. These ones are. Other waters would not be. The United States has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely these constellation of facts. So its   its position is basically: we say it, therefore it must be so. I  \n But it's not the United States that will be making the judgment about what areas are controlled. It would be the country abroad. And I   I think the argument was, what the United States does other nations will copy.\n Right.\n And they will decide what looks like the Alaska  \n Right. What the United States does, Your Honor, is follow the well-settled international law on historic bays   historic waters. Those are set forth in the convention. Each state will have the same authority where its facts and circumstances dictate it. If there has been a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the acquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as historic waters. But it has to be done based on a   an examination of the particular facts of the case. And one thing else   one thing other that is worth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a nation can always close it off using article 4 straight baselines. That is permitted under the convention. The U.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are fully able to do that. I think that if the United States is going to be arguing that there is some international precedent here that's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a particular body water abroad that it believes this case is going to affect.\n Why should it make that suggestion? It would certainly not be in the interest of the United States.\n Well, it   it needs to explain more specifically then, other than just stating we think it might affect our position. The   the facts and circumstances   the Court, for example, applied the historic bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the Mississippi Sound case. I am aware of no instance in which that precedent was ever used adversely and the United States has not identified any   any instance. But more importantly, what this Court did in the Mississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it said is this a historic bay or is it not. The Court concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the Court follows. At this point, I'd like to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.\n Yes, Mr. Franklin. Mr. Minear.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I would like to begin with the focal point of Alaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park. Alaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the statehood act does not provide an adequate showing that the United States intended to retain the submerged lands in Glacier Bay. For this  \n Could   before you go into that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?\n Yes. In fact, I think it's very helpful. It's listed at page 7a  \n I mean, (e)  \n   of our   of the gray brief.\n Yes, but the   well   well, the   the introduction to it is   is not listed, is it? I mean  \n That may   that may be so.\n I mean, it's incomplete. It   it just says all real and   what about all real and personal property? Is there an intro that says there is hereby   there is hereby granted to the United   to Alaska?\n Well, 6(e) I think begins stating that this   these are exceptions to section 5 which is the retention   the general retention provision of the United   for United States lands. But if we look at 6(e) itself, it's  \n Well, you say they're exceptions. How   how are the exceptions introduced? I mean, it's incomplete to just read (e) that says all   what about all real and personal property of the United States? There has to be some introductory language. What is it?\n No. Actually there doesn't, Your Honor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal property   then you skip down, about halfway down   shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropriate Federal agency. So it is   so this is complete in terms of  \n Okay. Okay. You're right.\n But if I could walk you through those provisions because I think they're quite important. The first provision says, as you say, all real and personal property which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall be transferred to the United States.\n Right.\n It's followed by another provision here.\n To   to Alaska.\n To   to Alaska. Excuse me. And it's followed by another proviso which says that the United States will continue to control fish and game matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has certified that Alaska is ready to do so. Clearly that proviso is not a subset  \n Mr. Minear, before you get too far, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that was raised by Justice O'Connor before. Do you agree that section 5 itself, the second part of it that says the United States retains title to its own property, that the response to that is adequately provided in the Submerged Lands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?\n No, I don't. I don't believe   let me frame the   your   your question, if I may, for you. Section 5 indicates the United States would retain all of the lands that it presently holds. Section 6(m) then makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the   to the   to Alaska. In doing so, it recognizes that there are some lands the United States would continue to retain, provided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands Act. The particular exception we're concerned about here is the expressly retained exception, in other words, if lands are retained by the United States. This Court said in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts the general law that applied before the Submerged Lands Act, that it had to be made plain that the United States would be holding onto these lands. It doesn't require an express statement. It simply requires that it be made plain. Now, our view is that these lands would be retained by the United States, quite apart from 6   the 6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary judgment. And if you denied our motion for summary judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions that are applicable. But in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e) and we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic Coast decision made clear that 6(e)   and I quote   reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote, to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife   or reservations for the protection of wildlife.\n Well, we didn't have this issue before us. Let   let me  \n Yes, we did.\n   let me   why don't you go back to your argument? You said that the first proviso on its face is simply not a subset of the first part of (e).\n Yes. It's an example how provisos do not need to be  \n But that's not the proviso at issue here.\n Yes.\n The proviso at issue here is the second proviso which begins provided that such transfer shall not include lands. Such transfer. Now, this is   the word such refers you back to something. What   what possible transfer could it mean except the end of the introduction, which says shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska?\n Your Honor  \n I mean, anybody reading that would   would think that proviso refers to that transfer or at least it is not clear that it provides to   that it applies to every transfer in   in the whole act.\n I disagree with you, Justice Scalia, for these reasons. First of all, the such transfer simply tells you what's not included. That language tells you   this is outside. It doesn't mean that whatever follows necessarily was within the main clause. What Congress was doing here, by making clear that these lands were not transferred  \n What does the such refer to?\n It does refer to the transfer before. But what follows here, refuges and reservations for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within that   that main clause. It's obvious they don't because the only things that fit within the main clause are those lands and real property specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. What we're talking about here   wildlife reservations are multiple purpose lands. They're not used solely for   for the purpose of conservation. The purpose of the first provision here was to transfer vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State would need to enforce Alaska game laws. That was the point of   of that first provision. But Secretary Chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative history that what he was doing was drawing a line between those   those facilities and equipment that are used by a State in its traditional game management and drawing a contrast with the matters that would be retained by the United States.\n Where is the language that says that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained by the United States?\n We do not need  \n What the proviso says is just what Justice Scalia said.\n We do not need express language that expresses  \n No, no, but where is the implication in that?\n The implication is that we are retaining all of the reservation. And this is what the Court said in the Arctic Coast decision. It saw that this was  \n That's   that's   it   I mean, in   in   I take it in the Alaska case we were considering a transfer that did fall within the main sentence of (e).\n Justice Breyer, neither party made that argument. This issue came up in a letter that was written after. The   the language  \n Were we or weren't we?\n You were not considering that.\n We weren't.\n That   that was   simply neither party suggested that ANWR fell within the first provision. And it doesn't. It's clear that it doesn't. It was not land that was specifically used solely for conservation of wildlife under these three listed statutes. The ANWR reservation at that time was set apart. It was BLM land. It was also used for mining and other activities. Likewise, the other matters  \n But the Court did assume   the Court did assume that.\n Yes.\n It made that assumption with no briefing, but it did that with regard to the second issue that was presented there. The issue that people were fighting about in the Arctic Coast decision was was this land properly set apart or not for purposes of the proviso. And that's where this discussion takes place.\n All right. Then  \n It's an afterthought that simply reinforces.\n All right. Then at best Alaska is a neutral. Because we didn't think it, we're operating as a mistake. It's a neutral. Okay. Now, what's bothering me about the case is just what Justice Scalia said, that   that why I   if I sell you all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping gear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation of mess kits from some other transfer? I mean, it has nothing to do with mess kits.\n Your Honor, but that's   it's clear that what this is   this is more along the lines if someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that transfer shall not include the detached garage.\n Fine, and then it doesn't go in that.\n In that case  \n But it doesn't mean that the next  \n Yes, but it was not a part of the house.\n Yes.\n You know, that's   it's just providing clarification, just that one of the purposes of the proviso is to provide clarification.\n This is an abundance of caution?\n In other   that is exactly right. And we can tell that from  \n All right. If it's an abundance of caution, where's the other language that almost reserves it so we need the caution?\n That would be section 5. It indicates the general retention for lands of this sort.\n But 5 is subject to the Submerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you back to the reservation has to be explicit. And then   see, that's  \n Well, Justice Breyer, again, if I can just complete the point  \n That's why I was talking about Yellowstone.\n Yes.\n I was looking for something that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to transfer. He comes back and says, well, very often States do control the water.\n Your Honor, I just need to make a point. I think it's very important for you to understand this point. First of all, that at page 57 of the Arctic Coast decision, this Court was clearly reading this language, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a clear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that these particular items that are discussed there are not a part of the main clause and cannot be. And a good example of that is the third thing that's being transferred, facilities that are utilized in connection with general research activities related to fisheries and wildlife. Now, that is not going to be something that's specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. It's the antithesis of that. It makes quite clear that our construction is correct. The subset theory just doesn't work because the items that are here are not things that fit within the main clause. What Congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line  \n But why   why doesn't (m) supersede that argument anyway? Let's   can't we say that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?\n Then you have to explain what happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main provision. And that is because Congress was making   because this Court concluded that Congress was making clear that wildlife lands are very important and they wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not be transferred. And even a provision that could be misconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in   in Arctic Coast   could be misconstrued to contain some of these lands, we need to make adequate assurance that   that the courts that read this realize a clear division is being made. We are retaining these wildlife lands. That's  \n Mr. Minear, I'm   I'm not sure I agree with you that   that that language, facilities used in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the earlier   of the earlier grant, namely property used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of fisheries and wildlife. Surely one   one can readily regard general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and protecting fisheries and wildlife.\n But we're talking about a facility here. So a facility that might conduct some   some research tangentially related to wildlife is not a facility that's used for the sole   specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife. There's a clear difference here. These two   these two sets do not overlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife refuges. Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are used for multiple purposes. At the time of statehood, the   the regulations in place, the fisheries regulations and wildlife regulations, made clear that permits could be issued for purposes apart from wildlife conservation. And this Court's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized that one of the   the refuges that Alaska cites as being included in the main clause was being used for oil and gas purposes. It was not being used solely for the purposes   specifically used solely for the purposes of conservation.\n Mr. Minear, you know, I   I am just overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible mess of a statute. I can't figure out what it means.\n Well, Your Honor  \n And   and it seems to me that's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.\n Your Honor  \n There are arguments here, there are arguments there, but it   it does not dawn upon me that   that anything is clear about this at all.\n Well, this   we believe the statute has been clear for 50 years. That's why these issues have only arisen recently with regard to Glacier Bay National Park.\n Mr. Minear, what do you say are the practical consequences from the Federal Government's perspective of going   of disagreeing with the U.S. position? What harm is done? Can the U.S. protect itself in any event under other clauses?\n We agree that the United States has the regulatory authority to protect   to limit vessel entries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not what our concern is. Our concern is with the actual use of the submerged lands. This is a laboratory. This is a laboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use the submerged lands for that purpose. That includes such things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze its historic features. We've installed a 5-mile cable with a hydrophone on the   on the submerged lands so we can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the   the volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that migrate through there.\n Don't you do that on   on dry land in some States?\n Your Honor, in order to hear vehicle traffic  \n Doesn't your authority under the Commerce Clause or under   under   over navigable waters allow you to do that kind of stuff?\n Your Honor, we think that   that Alaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot withdraw materials from the submerged land which we use and study. And in fact, I would point out that the park superintendent's affidavit  \n Are they likely to do that?\n What?\n Are they likely to do that? Is this a real problem?\n There are 900 papers, scientific papers, that are cited in the affidavit of the park superintendent. This is exhibit number 8 on count IV. And of those describing the type of research we do in Glacier Bay National Park  \n Well, I thought  \n   scores and perhaps hundreds of those involve submerged lands.\n All right. Given what you're saying   and I   you're not accepting this I think, and I   well, there is language in this act which maintains in the United States title to the park.\n That is correct.\n All right. Now, I would have thought when you get title to the park, you mean the park, and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the park.\n We  \n And therefore, if you have a part of the park which is the only part of the park where people look at the park, and it's the only part of the park that brings them into the park, and it's the only part of the park where you do the research, et cetera, that's the park. Just as if I were to sell my house and I list the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen is an essential part of the house.\n That's  \n Now   now, once I made that argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but really, there are all kinds of instances where States have reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's worked fine.\n But those are instances  \n What's your response to all this?\n The instances   the examples they're giving are cases in which we've created those national monuments or parks after statehood. And in those cases, we cannot acquire those lands because they have already been transferred to the State at statehood.\n It hasn't resulted in a   in a disaster. That's the point that Justice Breyer is making.\n But in this case  \n It has not resulted in a disaster.\n But in this case, it is going to impede the   the activities we have there. And a good example of this is in the amicus brief at page 25 where Alaska does not even assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife. The Alaska legislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife within the park. This gives you some sense of the type of difficulties that we're going to encounter.\n Mr.  \n And our chief concern  \n Mr. Minear, may I ask you? At the time the statute was passed, was the national Government conducting these activities?\n Yes, it was. It was created as a national monument. Now, in terms of what degree of activities, the record is not clear, but we're  \n Maybe you were monitoring passages through to see whether the whales were going to be interfered with and doing that sort of thing. Were you taking core samples?\n We were definitely studying the bed of the lake, and our   our briefs below explain. We have an affidavit from our glaciologist which describes the type of research that was being done.\n So in   in other words, you   you're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the passage, this would have been on the congressional mind, going back to Justice Breyer's  \n It   it definitely would have. And also I want to point out that when we created the national monument, we also preserved such things as the interglacial forests. These are forests that are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go forward over these submerged lands. The glacial forests are in the submerged lands, and so they become a part of it. As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely that other glacial forests will be revealed, and those should remain a part of the park. That was part of the purpose, was to study those  \n Should. Now, you're not   how far are you prepared to go? You can't go more than your brief and your facts justify. Are you prepared to say that this water is an essential part of the park?\n Yes.\n Yes?\n Yes. Certainly  \n Have you said that before this minute?\n Not only have we said it, but the Park Service at statehood said that this is a water park when they were describing these lands and saying why they should be retained. They told Congress   the   the park superintendent or the   the director of the Park Service said this is a water park that's mostly   this is, after all, Glacier Bay National Park. And in that   with that respect, I'd like to point out this  \n Why did they keep the other 80 percent then?\n Excuse me, Your Honor.\n Why did they keep the other 80 percent?\n Well, the  \n I gather only 20 percent of it is water.\n It's slightly more than 20  \n They should have given away the rest.\n We haven't given away. We have all of these lands. The   the uplands here are the glaciers and the mountains that are inaccessible except by the water. You cannot reach these areas. There are no roads in this park except for the park visitors center, and beyond that  \n Then make it a water park. I mean, you want to say it's a   it's a water-accessible park, fine.\n Yes. But, Your Honor, the  \n 20 percent of the park is under water. Right?\n More than 20 percent. Roughly 25. I'd say close to 25 percent of the park is   within the park boundaries is submerged lands. But there's another point I'd like to make with regard to the establishment of the park. This park was created under the Antiquities Act, and under the Antiquities Act, the President is given authority to create national monuments, but they cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress. Now, Congress could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to give up the land. It could have disestablished some part of it, and it chose not to do so. And yet, that's another indication that Congress was intending to retain these lands. Now, I would like to move on to the other two counts we have here, unless we have further questions about   about Glacier Bay. But I   I think one thing that I do   one thought I want you   to leave you with with regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are essential to the park. They are understood to be essential at the time that the park was created. And the   the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one with regard to this park. Those lands are   continue to be used   the submerged lands for scientific research that is vitally important. Now, I'd like to point out that the master also correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits are historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska failed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test. This Court specifically failed to show a continuous assertion of   of sovereignty to exclude vessels that have   that are visiting the park or passing through in innocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of foreign nations. During the past 150-year period, neither Alaska nor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel based on   merely on innocent passage. Rather, Alaska   Alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we unambiguously did so. The only  \n Alaska is arguing, as I understand it now, that the   the exclusion for purposes of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a matter of international law, which is a point that you disagree on. What   what is your response to their response to  \n The answer is in order to establish a historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage. Fisheries is not   engaging in fishing activity under the convention is not innocent passage. And so, therefore, an exclusion based on fisheries can never   can never give rise to a claim of  \n And what's   what's your best authority for that?\n Well, our best authority is the convention itself. The convention makes clear under article 14 that fisheries is   that fisheries activities are not innocent passage. Rather, innocent passage is merely transit through from one point to another. Moreover, the Marguerite incident that they describe involves a single incident; that is, it does not satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland   the historic inland waters test requires. And finally, it also didn't satisfy the acquiescence test since the British Government protested the seizure of the ship. And finally on top of that, this vessel   we don't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that it was seized. There continues to be a dispute and the master was unable to determine whether that   the ship was in   inside or outside the 3-mile limit. Now, I'd also like to speak briefly to the juridical   juridical bay claim as well. This is a matter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine it would address on rebuttal. The master correctly rejected Alaska's extraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be turned into two large   large juridical bays. And basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland on an island. Now, that does not suffice the purpose of the convention. The only way that it can establish a bay headland or   or closing point is by showing that it's on the mainland. In order to establish that this is on the mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of water. And as the master recognized, these bodies of water are simply too substantial to ignore. In the case of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on average 4 and a half miles wide. It's   simply those intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish that this is   is part of the mainland. It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which is a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for international navigation. That too precludes it from being ignored and treated as dry land. The failure of those two assimilations by itself is sufficient to establish that   that these   that these juridical bays do not exist. And even if that were not enough, the master went on to say that this would not be a well-marked indentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate these lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would not be   the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is passing by. For all those reasons, the juridical bays here are   are simply not well founded, and the master was correct in rejecting them. So what we see  \n Mr. Minear, could I go back to Glacier  \n Certainly, Your Honor.\n   Park again for a moment and ask why the Government decided to base its claim to the lands in Glacier Bay exclusively on that murky provision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards set out in the Idaho case?\n Well, Your Honor  \n Do you   do you not rely on that standard  \n Quite  \n   of analysis?\n Quite honestly we thought that under the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required to create absolutely new   no new law. It had already interpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e) applied to this case. We think the Idaho provisions provide another opportunity for us to establish it. It's quite clear that the purposes of the   the lands here, the submerged lands, are so essential to the park that it's simply inconceivable that Congress would have intended for those lands to pass out of ownership. However, we relied on  \n Would you   would you tell us again why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you still go back before the   the Special Master to show certain facts?\n Well, first of all, Alaska has not moved for summary judgment. We moved for summary judgment on some of our theories. Other theories would require some factual development. One of the theories that we would   we would go forward with is that these lands are occupied under a claim of right, and that's another exception under the Submerged Lands Act. In addition, we would renew the argument with regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an area and authorizes the President to set it aside under the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain those lands.\n Well, given the absence of a summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.\n No. You would not have   we   we believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not think that he foreclosed it. But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's important and worthwhile. We think that this case falls squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in particular we relied on it primarily because it provides an actual textual basis for showing that the   the United States retain those lands. We do not need to go further and show purpose, although we certainly can. We relied on the Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear example of why retention is   is required in this case. The master agreed with us. He analyzed the Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the   the proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent retention clause. There's no other way to understand the Arctic Coast decision except on that basis. And we think that's the right interpretation, and we think if we   if you focus on what the Court said on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear. The statement that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test is an afterthought at the end of the opinion. It's a statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce the conclusion it's already reached. It doesn't provide a basis for   for departing from that. And in fact, as I hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't make any sense, that they're simply   all of those lands that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall within the main clause. The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple purposes. It's   the two wildlife refuges that they point to both the record shows were used for multiple purposes. They were not used solely for conservation purposes. And in addition, they were   to the extent that those refuges adverted to any lands at all   any statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not   not the 1943 statute. Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has no answer for. One   one of those refuges, in particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other areas. It clearly is being used for those purposes. We think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did intend to retain these lands. That was the point that   that this proviso, as Secretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he stated in   the excerpt appears in page   on page 47, note 37 of our brief. He stated that these reservations   the land and water would be reserved. He clearly was aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to reserve both land and water. Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back and look at the big picture here. The United States' position overall results in a very sensible division of submerged lands in this case. We have not contested Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest. Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal Government interests are paramount. First of all, with regard to drawing international   developing international principles to establish baselines, which creates these bays and   and pockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our foreign policy requires. Secondly, where the United States has clearly reserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National Park. This park was set aside for the benefit of the entire Nation. We think that the Court should adopt the master's report in full. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Franklin, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n Thank you, Your Honor. To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact, advocating the principles of that case. It is not sufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation that might include submerged lands. Congress has to take some action to explicitly ratify that. That was what happened in the Idaho case, according to the Court. And the United States has identified one statute and one statute only that it asserts can   ratifies the bay, and that's section 6(e), the proviso. We think the plain language to section (e)   6(e) is dispositive in this case. We are operating here under a clear statement rule. The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended that the submerged lands   title to submerged lands be defeated. There was   the statute says such transfer shall not include. There simply was no need for Congress to have included   to have specified that such transfer, the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged lands when they were not included   or excuse me   shall not include properties that were not included in the first place. That includes Glacier Bay.\n Would   would you respond to the   to the argument that the Alaska Arctic Coast case decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?\n Well, my   my first response is even the master, who ruled   who   who decided against us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60 and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within the proviso. Therefore   excuse me. The main clause. Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held that lands that did not fall within the main clause were included by the proviso. It is important, though, to   to note this, that even if the statute is ambiguous   and we think that it is not   Alaska still prevails here because a   there is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.\n But the   the argument is that it is clear because the reservation without the reservation of the waters would be crazy.\n Well, it  \n Why isn't   I mean, what's   what's the answer?\n We dispute that for the following reason, Your Honor, that   that the   the point of the monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the glaciers as they recede on dry land. Title to the submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose. But I think their sky-is-falling argument really falls apart here. All that the counsel can point to is the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom. There is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would   would prevent scientists who want to study this   these lands from doing that. We let scientists onto all of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they have a good reason for doing it. We hope to work cooperatively with the Federal Government on this. The   the idea that Alaska is somehow going to be less receptive to scientific research here I think demeans our Federal structure. We have a Federal structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands is given to the States because they are viewed as the ones principally affected by the activities that go on there. We are not planning on   on preventing scientists from scuba diving down there. By the way, they did not at the time of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because there   there really wasn't any scuba diving going on. But to   to move on   I see my time is up.\n Thank you, Mr. Franklin. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court: Kansas would like to address three issues today. 50 years of success of the Court's river master on the Delaware River and 16 years of success of the Court's river master on the Pecos River demonstrate the wisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate circumstances on a river like the Arkansas River, which is the subject of this case. Secondly, the Court should affirm the neutral principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages owing at the time interest begins to run. And third, a 1-year compliance period would be consistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and would preserve an essential right of Kansas and its farmers under this   this compact that would otherwise be lost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year accounting period. With respect to this accounting period, I would note that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court has relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, which is the standard for compact compliance in this case. In the first opinion in 1995, this Court distinguished between monthly and   and seasonal use of the model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but that seasonal reliance on the model for determining useability under article IV-D of the compact was reasonable. When the case was back here in 2001, this Court reviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a yearly basis. As you can imagine, the factors that go into calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H I Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently accurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.\n Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm wrong. I   I looked at these papers a while ago. I thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate the   the relevant amounts in the 10th year.\n That is correct, Your Honor. It is a moving accumulation of 10 years of results.\n So they do use 10 years of figures to determine what the relevant year's water would be.\n That's correct, Your Honor. In other words, the   the annual determination includes the most current year for which there is data and the previous 9 years, adds all those up, nets out the pluses and minuses, and that determines whether in the year in question there is compliance with the compact.\n This will begin in 2007, as I recall. Is that  \n That is the special master's proposal, yes.\n And what I don't understand is even   even if we agree with you that it should be done annually, why   why wouldn't you propose that it be done annually using the previous 7 years' experience that we now have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can use the previous 10 years? I   I don't understand why we have to do it year by year and forego even 7 years'benefit of   of this methodology.\n Your Honor, I couldn't agree with you more in the sense that we should begin now with the accounting so that you look each year at the results of this standard, which has been approved by the Court, for compact compliance in that year only, and if   if you accumulate it  \n No. That   that's   I said just the opposite. I said I   I don't know why we should begin looking for this   at this year only using this methodology. Why shouldn't we average this methodology over the previous 7 years?\n Your Honor, averages will tend to smooth out the results and will hide the effects during dry years, which is when the farmers in Kansas, who are the beneficiaries that Kansas intended to benefit   and both parties realize that. They need this water  \n But your method   your method will over-emphasize the dry years. So either way you have a   a imperfect situation. In your case, year by year, and in a dry year, Colorado perhaps must over compensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row, then it's going to be   work out to Colorado's disadvantage.\n Your Honor, I believe the   the result is the   is the opposite. If I may explain. The model, the   the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, has been made as unbiased as possible. The one aspect in which we have identified a bias is that it favors Colorado during dry years. It tends to underestimate the depletions that would have to be replaced by Colorado.\n That's the method that you're attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't it be just the reverse?\n We don't believe that aspect of the model would be any different if we're doing it year by year. We'd simply be taking the results that are calculated each year under either approach and use those in that year so that if you have a dry year, you are   are calculating in that year whether there is compliance and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the compact, which is to provide water when the farmers need it.\n Do you   do you dispute what   what the master found here, that the methodology is more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by year?\n No, Your Honor. The longer the period of time you take, the more the accumulated results of the model will match the measured  \n The actual year-by-year results. Right?\n Yes, and I should point out that it's impossible to know what the right answer is. You can   you can measure the flows and the diversions in the river and compare that to one of the runs of this model, but it's the difference between the two runs, one representing the compact condition, which is supposed to be met, and the other representing the situation with the wells operating. And it's the difference between those two whose accuracy is in question.\n Yes, but I   I  \n And no one knows what that is.\n I understand that   that the master concluded that even as to a particular year, the model will be more accurate if you use the average from the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model to a single year, that even as to the real results for that single year, the model will be more accurate if you use a 10-year average.\n Your Honor, I don't understand it that way. If you use 10 years, you are adding to the most recent year results 9 years of pluses and minuses that's going to, in most case, mask what happened during that next previous year. You will be looking at a 10-year accumulation of ups and downs and not analyzing what happened in   in the year in question.\n Is part or all of the objectives of both the   the decree and the 10-year model to conserve subsurface reservoirs?\n Not   not directly, Your Honor. It   it does preserve that reservoir in fact because depletion of that reservoir affects the stream flows, and it's the stream flows that are compacted here and that have up to now  \n Well, then   well, then why isn't   if   if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado shouldn't get credit for the wet years in   in   on an average? You're concerned about the dry years. It seems to me that Colorado should be given some credit for the wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are   are replenished. Or am I wrong   am I wrong about that?\n I think in general, Your Honor, you are   are correct. The question about there are over deliveries by Colorado, I believe is what you're addressing, is there   is there a way to give Colorado credit for that. And there is a way. There is a   a   an account in John Martin Reservoir, which is 60 miles above the State line, for those deliveries. When they are delivered there, if there is more delivered than is actually needed in that year to achieve compact compliance, that can be retained there and, except for a small effect of evaporation, is available to offset depletions in the following year.\n I   I thought that the compact specifically provided there shall be no allowance or accumulation of credits or debits for or against either State.\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n Well, how does that comport with what you just said?\n Under those circumstances, the water that would be delivered to this offset account in John Martin Reservoir is not a credit that's accounted under the compact for that year. So it would not enter into the compact accounting for that year. It would not constitute a   a credit, but it would be available as a practical matter to be used as a credit in the next year for current depletions. So there would be no carryover in compact accounting.\n I don't   I don't understand that statement. You say it would be available to be used as a credit in a subsequent year. Do you really mean it would be used as a credit, or do you mean it would simply be there to be used?\n I think your formulation, Your Honor, is   is more correct.\n Okay.\n It would be there to be used, and it would not be a credit for accounting purposes. Yes.\n Well, if it's not a credit for accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as much the next year even though   even though you had more water the previous year.\n This is under the assumption, Your Honor, that they have already met their obligations in the current year.\n Yes.\n And it will be available as a practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent year and be accounted in that subsequent year. I would point out that this is very important for Kansas farmers that the   the water be received when it is supposed to be delivered under the compact. If water is   is not delivered, as required, in one year, it cannot be recouped in a following year, certainly not 10 years later, as would be possible under the special master  \n Well, then why are you using a 10-year model at all?\n It's not a 10  \n It seems to me what you're   what you're saying is forget the 10 years. Just do it every year.\n That's what we are saying, Your Honor. And the model is inherently a yearly model. It calculates actually results on a monthly basis, and we have used it   and the Court has relied upon it   on a yearly basis up to now.\n Why don't you do it on a monthly basis? Indeed, why don't you do it on a daily basis? I mean, the master found that this model really works if you   if you stretch it out over 10 years. You say 1 year. Why don't you do it month by month?\n Well, it   it could be done that way, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this same model in its own administration of groundwater pumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of protecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires replacement of water on a monthly basis. So it is   it is possible. But we believe with the yearly accumulation that   that we have relied upon so far in this case and that the Court has relied upon specifically for damages, that that is an appropriate accounting period for this particular purpose. And that is   that is our proposal. The proposal of Colorado is no, let's wait 10 years before   and   and accumulate it with the other 9 years before we require any replacement. I would point out that the H-I Model, the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, is the best tool available for this purpose. It was endorsed by Colorado after the Court's first opinion in this case when it   the Court approved using the model on a seasonal basis for the seasonal accounting of useability. At that time, Colorado gave up its own model in favor of the Hydrologic Institutional Model, and as you can see from the master's report, there have been several significant improvements in the model since that time. I would also point out the correspondence   the close correspondence that exists between this case and the Pecos River litigation in the 1980's. There you had a compact that like this compact did not specify any specific quantity of water in the compact itself, but indicated that there was to be no depletions beyond the depletions that were occurring at the time of the compact with a few small amendments that I could   I could mention. But the basic similarity of the compacts is that the status quo at the time of the compact was maintained. There was an inflow/outflow relationship that needed to be observed and was required to be observed by the compact. It was expressed explicitly in the Pecos River compact by a reference to an inflow/outflow method. In this case, it was expressed implicitly in article IV-D of the compact.\n The master found that the role of the river master in the Pecos case was quite different than the role of the river master you want to have appointed here. He found that the role of the river master in the Pecos cases was really ministerial.\n Your Honor, we do not agree with that.\n You don't agree with what?\n With the description of the Pecos River master as being   as having only ministerial duties, and I can explain why.\n Please do.\n Yes. if   if you refer to the appendix of our   our blue brief, on page A-22, you will see that the opening section of the Pecos River master's manual sets out the inflow/outflow relationship that is to be observed in complying with that compact. This is the form of an equation. You can see y equals and a   and a number there. In   in our case, we have the   the Hydrologic-Institutional Model, which benefits from several decades of increased sophistication in hydrologic analysis to do the same job.\n The Pecos master can simply apply this formula, can he not, and get the results that the compact requires?\n He   he is to apply the formula, Your Honor, but there's a great deal of judgment, professional, expert judgment that needs to be exercised in order to apply it. For example, you have to separate flood flows from base flows. When you look at the   at the results of a   of a gauge on a river, you can see how much water was in the river at particular times, but this has to be separated into two different kinds of flows that are treated differently under this compact.\n Well, one of the reasons I'm curious is that I believe the Pecos master is an engineer. He's not a lawyer.\n That's correct.\n He's also the cheapest master we've ever had. (Laughter.)\n But it seems to me that the master you want appointed has got to be a lawyer and make legal decisions.\n Your Honor, I don't believe so. I think our master would be just as cheap. (Laughter.)\n What's the difference  \n No. The question was what about the  \n What   what relation do you or   yes   working relation do you anticipate, if   if the river master is appointed, between the river master and the commission? Does he go first to the commission and try to get agreement or  \n Your Honor, no, he would not formally interact with the commission, just as the Pecos River master does not formally interact with the Pecos River commission.\n Well, what can   what can the river master do that the   that the commission or authority can't do? I   is the difference between the two of them   call it a jurisdictional difference   nil, but there is process difference in the sense that the river master could say do this or don't do that, whereas your   your fear is that the authority is simply going to be deadlocked because everything has to be done unanimously? Is it a process difference?\n It is a process difference, Your Honor. The  \n But for that, you wouldn't be asking for a river master then.\n Well, if there were an authoritative way, such as a river master, by which the annual recurring exercise of judgment could be accomplished, we would not need the river master. But I don't  \n But aren't you bypassing what Congress set up? You have this interstate compact and this commission, which you're saying, well, it's ineffective because it has to   there are three from each State and it has to do everything unanimously. But what about the commission's authority to call in an   an arbitrator when they are deadlocked?\n That decision also requires unanimity, Your Honor, and in the one case I'm aware of, Kansas' suggestion of doing an arbitration was rejected by Colorado. It's   but it's   it takes unanimity to do anything under that compact administration, including the arbitration option.\n But you're saying Congress  \n Mr. Draper, could I ask you what is a matter of procedure? What is your understanding of   of how one would go about challenging the river master's decision if one disagreed with it? Do you go to the special master? Do you come direct to this Court?\n Your Honor, we have suggested that it be set up just as you have set up the Pecos River master. In other words, if there were an objection to the determination, the yearly determination, of the river master, it would be reviewable by this Court.\n Directly.\n Directly.\n And the special master would be out. The special master would be out of the picture, as you describe it. You   the special master would be finished. The river master would take over. Has there ever been   has this Court ever appointed a river master when the special master did not recommend it? And as I understand both Delaware and the Pecos River case, the special master recommended the appointment of a river master.\n Your Honor, I believe in both of those cases, the   the special master was recommending the appointment of a river master, but I would point out that in setting out the criteria for appointing a river master, the Court did not refer to that factor as   as being part of the consideration.\n As I understand the system you propose, the river master's decision would be appealable to us, and we would review it de novo. Is that right?\n We're suggesting the same scope of review as on the Pecos, which is clearly erroneous. This, however, is something that the Court could decide to do differently than the Pecos, but the clearly erroneous standard comports with the   the way master recommendations are handled in the district court under rule 53.\n I'm very loathe to deprive either of the States of their   their right to have this Court decide matters between them.\n Your Honor, this would not deprive either State of that right. And in fact  \n Well, it would if they can only come here and   and overturn the river master if he's clearly erroneous. That's a   that's a very high standard.\n Well, there   as I say, the Court   the Court may set the review threshold as it sees fit.\n I   I had thought that your proposal was de novo review. This is   this is new to me, that   that you want it clearly erroneous.\n Your Honor, I would   I would say that we have   we have mentioned the clearly erroneous review standard because it was in the Pecos framework. It is not essential to our proposal. A de novo review would be perfectly fine with the State of Kansas.\n Suppose the commission decided to appoint an arbitrator. Would the special   pardon me. Would the river master then proceed independently and we'd have two different recommendations?\n As under the Pecos, Your Honor, if the   if the compact administration, as it's called in the   in the Arkansas Basin, is able to come to a resolution of an issue, then that would   that would take care of that issue. It would be   not be necessary to have the river master address that, and it would be an agreement of the States because it would either be an agreement because they had literally agreed before the   or in the form of the Arkansas River Compact Administration or that they had agreed to binding arbitration and had settled it.\n Well, then it would seem to me, procedurally at least, the river master would have if not the legal, at least the practical obligation to refer things first to the commission.\n Your Honor, the referral of matters to the commission is why we're here in the first place. It cannot act without unanimity. The State of Colorado, the State in possession of this resource, can veto each and every action of the compact administration.\n That was the deal.\n Your   yes. Your State agreed to it.\n That was the deal they came to. Why should we kick it over? They came to that arrangement, and it was approved by Congress, and now you come back and tell us, oh, this is too cumbersome. You should   you should appoint this river master to do an end run around it. I   I   it doesn't seem to me to be fair.\n Your Honor, I don't believe that this is an end run any more than the enforcement of the compact is an end run around the administrative body that is set up in many of these compacts. Those are keep-in-touch type bodies. If they can agree on things, they are very useful, and the Arkansas River Compact Administration has been useful in areas where there can be agreement.\n No, but you   you agree that this is the   the authority here is more than a keep-in-touch group. Your problem with it is   is not that you need something more than keep in touch, but that when you ask them to do something more than keep in touch, the other State has a veto. And   and that simply gets you to Justice Scalia's objection. That's the deal you made.\n That is the   that is the nub of our argument against reliance on the Arkansas River Compact Administration, that you can't look at it to settle differences about the implementation of this Court's decree.\n What did the special  \n That is a  \n What did the special master mean when he said he recognized the unanimous vote problem, but he said, but the climate may be changing? The compact administration under the chairmanship of the United States representative may again be seen as the best way to administer their compact and settle issues. What was he talking about?\n Your Honor, I think he was talking about the hope that he has that the States could work more cooperatively now, despite the fact that it was on this river between these two States that this Court was first asked to resolve interstate river disputes between States in 1901, and we are here today still in dispute over this river.\n So there was nothing tangible behind his  \n Nothing tangible, Your Honor. We   perhaps he was thinking of the settlement that we have achieved on the Republican River. That case started, was accepted by this Court. After rulings by this Court, it became possible to settle that case. It has now been settled. And the States involved in that litigation were Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado. It was possible in that   in that context. It has proven impossible in this context. And we can expect disputes to go on, as they have over the last century, if we do not have an impartial expert authority to resolve disputes between States that are going to come up every year. Every year there are questions. How do you take the data this year and put it into the H-I Model? While many of those issues have been settled, because different forms of replacement and other different circumstances arise, you have those every year. And if you follow the lead that the Pecos River cases of this Court give us, there is also the possibility to address the improvement of the tool for implementing the agreement of the States, and that is improving the Hydrologic-Institutional Model on occasion, as we have seen the master do over the course of this litigation. That is allowed under the Pecos River Decree, and we submit that it should be allowed under this decree as well. And that is when the master would be exercising the most judgment in our opinion. I would conclude by saying that a   a river master is needed on the Arkansas to deal impartially and expertly with annual questions that must be resolved to implement the H-I Model, and that a 1-year compliance period will implement the intentions of the drafters of the compact and the needs of Kansas farmers and is consistent with the yearly reliance that this Court has already placed on the H-I Model. I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal if there are no further questions.\n Very well, Mr. Draper. Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I will begin by discussing the river master since that's where Mr. Draper left off. I want to make it clear, first of all, that I disagree with the assertion that the Pecos River Compact and the Arkansas River Compact are similar in the way they operate. The Pecos River Compact did, in fact, specifically state that it was   it intended to hold the level of   of depletion of the system by man's development to the 1947 condition. The Arkansas River Compact, to the contrary, begins the   the limitation clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas Basin, provided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use for the uses. So the   the Arkansas compact contemplated that there would be a   a more flexible effort at using the water of the river by water users in both States, protecting the existing uses in both States from that future development. Now, this   this Court has appointed a river master in two circumstances. In both circumstances, as pointed out by Justice Ginsburg, the   the special master recommended that because of the specific circumstances of the case, that in fact a river master was appropriate. That was on the Delaware River and the Pecos River. In all other cases that deal with this issue where requests have been made by   by States without river   without a special master's recommendation, the Court has declined to appoint a river master. There's a very good reason, I think, behind that. Colorado alone is the party denying interstate compacts in two equitable apportionment decrees. If every time a State is dissatisfied with its neighbor, is dissatisfied with how a compact operates, it is able to come to this Court and say, please appoint a river master, we're just having trouble with our neighbor, you'll become the water management   the super water management agency for the country. You have river masters if you   it's totally up to   to your discretion. But if you were to follow this line of thinking, you end up supervising water distribution across the west and part of the east.\n Well, the disputes are going to come up here eventually anyway if the States are intransigent. Ultimately it will be a dispute about the application of the compact and it will come back here anyway, won't it?\n Justice Scalia, that is absolutely correct, but the difference is where compacts have mechanisms within them that are designed to work out these differences, I think it is in the Court's interest   and Colorado's position is and the special master's position was it was in the Court's interest   to refer these matters back to those compact administrations. You  \n Counsel, do you think it's any more likely today than in the past that the two States will be able to work out their continued disagreements?\n Justice O'Connor, I agree completely with the special master. The State of Colorado has proposed, as referred to in his ruling, that binding arbitration be used and has committed itself to participate in that. To the extent there   there have been past conflicts, Colorado has said let's get them behind us. Let's return to the compact, congressionally sanctioned method for resolving our differences, and let's proceed down the road. We will  \n But   but Colorado still has the veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will be appointed. Is that right?\n That is   under the compact, that's correct.\n Yes, yes.\n And so   but   but Colorado has made a   a very clear commitment to the special master and does so to this Court that if arbitration is proposed, Colorado would participate. We do not as a State find it very acceptable to spend the time, money, and effort to litigate these issues. After all, we have farmers. Kansas has farmers. We need to get back to getting the water equitably resolved through the compact mechanism. That is our proposal. It was  \n So is it right then that   let's imagine the special river master's name is Mr. Smith, and unlike me, he knows about this stuff. And he then   you   Kansas wants Mr. Smith to decide a certain number of issues. Call them issues on page 1, whatever they are. And as far as you're concerned, your client would say I'm happy to have Mr. Smith. Just don't call him a river master. Call him an arbitrator. So you're saying that when Kansas says they would do it except there's a problem of getting unanimity, you say the only problem is that you won't agree.\n At the present time, that's the posture  \n Now, they're the obstacle to unanimity. So the keys are in their own pocket if they want Mr. Smith. That's your view.\n Our view is if they want to arbitrate pursuant to the compact, the keys are in their   in their pocket. We do not believe  \n So the problem can't be one of unanimity because your side agrees. I mean, you heard what he said. So I'm   I'm trying to see  \n Our side agrees, Your   Justice Breyer, with   with the concept that this matter should be returned to the compact administration to resolve the differences in that forum.\n And   and in that forum, you will agree to binding arbitration.\n In that forum, we will agree to binding arbitration.\n Binding arbitration will   will mercifully keep this stuff off of our desk, won't it?\n Yes, it will. (Laughter.)\n I want   I want to make it very clear to the Court that the State of Colorado, different than the situation in the Pecos River, acted very aggressively to ensure that it promptly came into compliance with the   with the determination that in fact depletions were occurring, impermissible depletions were occurring to the Arkansas River. Within 2 years, the State of Colorado's legislature had passed the appropriate legislation. The State engineer had passed rules and regulations, implemented them, and enforced them. The State had authorized millions of dollars in loans for the acquisition of replacement water, and   and the State of Colorado   your   your ruling was in 1995. By 1997, it appears that the State of Colorado was in compliance with the compact. That is a significant and very difficult effort on the part of the legislature, the Governor, the attorney general, and the State engineer. We do not believe that this is anything like the Pecos River. Your master in this case has not said to you these parties are   are torn, will not get together, and you need to have a master, a river master, appointed. In this instance, the State of Colorado took the exact opposite approach. They did everything they could to reduce the pumping of the wells sufficiently to allow Colorado to meet the terms of the compact, and that is an important fact you need to glean from the special master's report. Now, the   the other   the only other point I want to make on this is that the   the   it's   it's very important, in deciding whether or not a river master is the appropriate course of action to determine   and I   I mentioned this earlier   whether or not the Court wants to be in a supervisory position. I happen to agree that the States are entitled to seek redress of their concerns before this Court, and as you said in   in Oklahoma v. New Mexico, you have a serious obligation to adjudicate disputes between the States where there are actual and existing controversies. And   and the fact that you would have a river master would not eliminate the potential for those controversies. In our view, the only way that you can get this matter off of your plate and into the position that Congress recognized and   and directed is to follow the special master's recommendation number 12. I'd now like to turn, if I may, to the issue of the accuracy of the model.\n May I ask you a question, because you may not bother to talk about it otherwise, about punitive damages? Your opponent didn't seem to think it very important, but I have this question. Is it your view that the other State waived its claim to the punitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it today or by submitting the different set of figures at the time the   the issue was before the master the last time around?\n Justice Stevens, in response to your question, we believe that in fact the issue of prejudgment interest, or punitive damages, is law of the case in this matter. The special master set out a formula by which he proposed how the damages should be calculated. Kansas argued for actual value of money, a rather rigid theory of compensation, and the special master chose in fact a balancing of the equities approach. He suggested that the appropriate means to calculate those   that prejudgment interest on the   the nominal damages  \n Did he   did he make that suggestion or did the other   did Kansas make that suggestion?\n The special master ruled on how he believed the damages should be calculated.\n In this time around or in the preceding  \n In the preceding time around. And what he said was that the damages from 1950 to 1968 should be   should   should receive a inflationary increase to reflect the inflationary tendencies, but that they should not be dealt with under prejudgment interest. In other words, it shouldn't be compounded through prejudgment interest. Only the damages from 1969 forward should be compounded using prejudgment interest. Kansas did not except to that methodology. Kansas excepted to the fact that he didn't give them prejudgment interest on the damages from 1950 forward. In the opinion that you authored for the Court, you accepted the master's methodology, and you did one thing and only one.\n Well, the master's methodology really wasn't at issue.\n The master's  \n The only issue before us, as I remember it, was the date from which the prejudgment interest would run.\n That's  \n That's   that's all that was argued. And it seemed to me that if it had been a fixed sum rather than an   a changing amount as years went by, that clearly we would have   the interest would have run on the existing liability. But it's an unusual case because the damages are changing as time goes by.\n It is and I agree with you, Justice Stevens. It is an unusual case. But the   the critical element here is that the master was looking for an equitable way to arrive at a damage sum.\n Well, except that, as I read his report, he was simply interpreting our opinion, best he could, on the second go-round.\n This   this go-round?\n Yes.\n That's correct, Justice Kennedy.\n And   and I think that's what's before us here. It   it seems to me that your best argument for no interest post '85 on the pre-'85 damages is to say, well, it's uncertain, it's hard to compute, but that doesn't quite work because this Court   and of course, the special master   allowed damages   the interest on post-'85 damages even though those are equally difficult to compute.\n It isn't the   if I may, Justice Kennedy, it isn't the  \n So I'm   I'm saying it seems to me that's your best argument, but there's a flaw in there.\n38 million. By moving the year forward from 1969 to 1985, you automatically then reduce, by some degree, the amount of that damage calculation.\n No, but did we   your   your view is that we entirely eliminated any interest on that past damage.\n Prejudgment  \n Pre-1985.\n The   the special master's methodology, Justice Stevens, was that the damages in his third report from 1950 to 1968 should not, under a balancing of the equities, bear prejudgment interest at any point in time. They should only be advanced for inflation, which was a proposal Colorado made because Colorado believed that it   the changing a 1950 damage to a   to a 2002, or at that time a 1994, dollar value was only fair and reasonable. We opposed the concept of giving prejudgment interest because it would   it would be   it's as if   if this were a commercial context, we would have been able to identify that there was a damage going on and the theory in your prejudgment cases is we could have put the money in the bank  \n But we rejected that as to post-'85 damages.\n You agreed that prejudgment interest, Justice Kennedy, should be applied to post-'85 damages, not to pre-'85 damages.\n Well, but our opinion didn't say it was just post-'85 damages. Our   our opinion didn't   didn't answer the question, and   and the reason, of course, is we didn't actually think about it because nobody even   nobody argued it at that time.\n Our view was that   that   our view is, Justice Stevens, that an exception needed to be taken if the master's methodology was under challenge.\n So in a way you really are arguing waiver I think.\n We are arguing law of the case. Yes, we are.\n Which is consistent with his failure to argue it today.\n That's   that is our position, Your Honor. I would like to, if   if I may, move off of prejudgment interest. I would like to talk, while I still have a few minutes, a little bit about this model and the 10-year average.\n Can you give   I'm   I'm not sure I understand the dispute. Can you give me in   in   without using up all of your time, a   basically a simple example to illustrate the difference between the two contending methodological positions?\n Yes, I can, Justice Souter. Under the   the master's formulation, which is agreed to by Colorado, the damages which occur in each year, 1950 through 1984, are   are computed at   in   as nominal damages in the year in which they occur. They are then expanded by the   by an inflationary formula which allows the dollar in 1950 to be calculated in a 2002 dollar. In 1985 and to the present, any damages that occur are advanced both for inflation, but then they are also awarded a prejudgment interest, which is compounded. In other words, if inflation is 2 or 3 percent through the period on a long-term average, but   but investments are at 6 or 7 percent  \n I got you.\n20-some million in the proposition, which we don't believe is what the Court intended. Let me   let me turn very quickly to the model, if I may. The   the issue here is not Colorado's obligation to deliver water to   to the river system. Colorado has both senior surface water rights and the State of Kansas that it has obligations to protect. Remember, the compact envisions that this subsequent development can't injure water users in either Kansas or Colorado. As a result, Colorado must ensure that on a monthly basis, water is placed into the river so depletions are   are compensated for in the system as they occur. The problem here is not that process. The problem here is a model that is inaccurate. Beginning in your first report, you quoted with favor the special master's comments about this model in dealing with the winter water storage program, which was an issue which you agreed should be dismissed several years ago. You indicated that depletions shown were well within the range of error and it could not be told if it was an impact or an error that the model was describing.\n Counsel, your time is running short. This is very important. I think you misunderstood Justice Souter's question. He asked you to give us an example of the Kansas versus Colorado approach as to the 10-year model. You answered him about the interest. Could you  \n I'm so sorry.\n   could you tell us really  \n Yes.\n Give us an example of the difference between the two.\n Yes. The difference between the two is this. We believe that the model over a long period of time, as it's developer, Mr. Durbin, said, is reasonably accurate. We   we agree with that, and we are willing to use it like that. But that means you have to use   look at it over extended periods of time. Our view is that you simply look at the model, which is predicting over-deliveries and under-deliveries, predicting them. They don't have any relationship to what Colorado is really putting into the system. They are predictions. And in some years where you   where you look back and you know from the gauges the model is over-predicting a significant amount, you   you want to be   and you know in a subsequent year it's going to under-predict, you want to allow that to smooth out so that you are, in fact, getting close to what's really going on. It is not an effort to carry dry-year depletions into wet years or vice versa. It is, in fact, an effort to allow the model's inherent inaccuracies to play out so that you get a more accurate result in each 10th year.\n Why doesn't   why isn't the result that you   of   of your position that you would get a more accurate set of predictions if all you were making was a 10-year calculation, but you will not get a more accurate set of predictions with respect to any one year? And in fact, it is with respect to any one year that's important under the compact. In other words, they   they plan every year, not every 10 years. So why does a 10-year accuracy help you in solving the practical problem you have on a year-to-year basis?\n As proposed by the special master, the model is not used every 10 year   or every 10th year. It's used every year. If you're looking at  \n I know. But it's used on the basis of 10-year figures which will not be accurate particularly with respect to any given year even though they would be   they would be accurate if you were only interested in a calculation every 10 years.\n You are making  \n Does it   can   can you   can you get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis is what I'm saying.\n You get a better prediction on a year-to-year basis. A   a better prediction if you're looking at the model over 10 years versus looking at the model just running it in a given year. Colorado does not want to be in a position, Justice Souter, where we are accused of violating the compact because there is an inaccuracy in the tool that is being used.\n Thank you  \n It  \n Thank you, Mr. Robbins.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It's the position of the United States that   that we agree with Colorado and with the special master that a river master should not be appointed in this case. The compact between the States of Kansas and Colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for implementing the obligations in that compact, which has to do with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount of water to Kansas. The commission is also charged with investigating violations of the compact, and the compact includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to binding arbitration if the   the States agree to that. The   the commission also certainly could use other dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the authority to do if it wanted to. The States have agreed to that. Congress has enacted it into law, and this Court should permit the parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that might arise in the future rather than putting a river master in place under the authority of this Court. Now, the Court has   itself has frequently stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort is preferable to litigation. As the special master pointed out, in the two river basins just north of the Arkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River, the parties recently, after having a dispute, including these very same two States in one of them, have come to a consensual resolution of the dispute that they had. And I think that does show, as the special master pointed out, that these   the States can   in fact, the disputes in those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect of well pumping, among other things. As the special master pointed out, I think that shows that the States can use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and this Court ought to continue its often-stated preference for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to problems of this sort. If the Court were to appoint a river master in this case, then I think the question would arise in any future case in which you have two States that have conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity, as what happened with river compacts, equitable apportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an inherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree or judgment. And I think rather than   that   that would be directly contrary to the Court's other statement in the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and that it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions, but also that the Court does not favor appointing agents or functionaries to carry out its decrees.\n So I guess we made a mistake with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other one? Delaware?\n Yes. The Pecos River   I mean, there were a couple of differences, in addition to the ones that Mr. Robbins pointed out. One difference is that not only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos River case   neither party objected to the appointment of a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of clothing the master with authority to make determinations that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous standard. In this case, there is a party that objects to it. And I would   I think there's another difference that's important that the Court ought to keep in mind. At the time the Pecos River master was appointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which the Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide for this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and the Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the   it provided that the river master in that case would be reviewed under that standard. As of 2003, rule 53   it's now rule 53(g)   provides that masters appointed by district courts said their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo standard unless the parties agree otherwise. Therefore, at the present time   and again, following the Court's rule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be guides   and I think they are a useful guide   the appropriate course here, if the Court were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one whose findings will be reviewable de novo. But that itself raises problems because if the findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's really just a continuation of the current litigation and it doesn't really advance things any. The parties will submit the evidence to the river master. He'll make his determinations, and then they'll come to the Court. That's really more what the special master does at the current time. So I think that under all of those circumstances, both the Court's preference for a consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the Court's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to decide cases of this sort and it can't   it's not the obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission that Congress has put into place specifically to deal with this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute resolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a river master in this case. As far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's the position of the United States also that the special master and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest should not be awarded. I think it's a familiar principle in   to this Court in litigation that if a party   when the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all of its objections if it wants the Court to hear them. In this case, the special master came up with a recommendation in his third report about how to   what should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the early years   the   the amount of the damages in those early years would never be subject to prejudgment interest. Now, Kansas objected to that and said we should move the year back to 1950. We should get prejudgment interest on everything back to year one. But they never made the objection that if you   if the Court disagrees with that, which it did, that the method that the master had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969 was incorrect. That was the time that Kansas should have brought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.\n So you're arguing they've waived the   your argument is they waived the objection basically.\n Yes. I think  \n I don't think you used the word waiver in your brief, and I don't think that Colorado did either. But I guess that's the essence of your argument.\n I   I actually think it's a combination of two things. On the one hand, what the Court actually said in its opinion was that the special master had awarded damages only insofar as necessary to satisfy the demands of equity, something to that effect.\n Would you not agree that if it was a one-shot injury, not an ongoing injury, that the normal reading would be the injury   the interest should run on the laws?\n I think in the normal contract case that doesn't have the kinds of equities that this case had, that is the current rule, that prejudgment interest would run. But this kind of case involves damages that go back 50-odd years. It could have been  \n And it involves continuing, ongoing  \n And they're   they're ongoing that are different in amount in every year, that it's not merely that Colorado was violating the compact as of 1950, although it probably didn't know it at that time, but that Kansas didn't bring a suit until 1985 and the fact, I think, that Colorado has always agreed to pay   to adjust the damages for inflation. So, in essence, Kansas is getting a portion of what the prejudgment interest would normally cover for those early years. I think if all that's put together, I think the Court's conclusion that the master's conclusion was just the amount that equity dictates was correct, and that if Kansas didn't like that, it should  \n Mr. Feldman, the Government takes no position on this 1-year versus 10-year computation?\n No, the Government doesn't have a position on that.\n Too hard for you? (Laughter.)\n That issue involves the particularities of this case and the Government doesn't really have a particular interest in how that gets resolved. If there's no further questions, that concludes the argument.\n Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Draper, you have 2 minutes remaining.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to state that we do not believe that we waived our position on the interest calculation as was just suggested in the   in the last colloquy. The reason that we didn't do that is because we filed an exception last time against every respect in which the special master was not recommending full interest. And it turned out that the Court chose the   the test that we now have, which is a relatively easy test to apply. It has certain incentives that grow out of it that make sense. And we believe that we sufficiently excepted to that. If look at our brief from that exception, the one in   in support of our exceptions, in particular   particularly to page 25, footnote 8, we specifically addressed the issue that the   the master was not allowing any interest in that 1950 through 1968 period.\n You're talking about the brief in the earlier case.\n In the earlier case, to the third report of the special master. I would   also, on the other points that were raised, you need to be  \n This is a lot of money involved, and   and you certainly didn't argue it here. I don't recall that point being argued. And with all that money being involved, I would have thought it would have been argued.\n Well, we were   we were arguing the larger issues on interest, but we were asking that interest not be denied to us during that '50 through 1968 period. That was very clear from our briefs, and we specifically singled out that part of it in that footnote. So I don't believe it's appropriate that   to conclude that we have waived that argument. And I would point out also that the only reason that it was done that way   and the calculations of the parties did   did in connection with that review   is because the special master required it. There is no other reason that we did it. We did not volunteer to do it that way. We did not like doing it that way. The master said that's the way it's going to be in my recommendation. How much would that amount to? We did not agree in any way to that part of the calculation. I would also point out that with respect to the amounts involved, that you need to be careful. The amounts cited by Mr. Robbins are not from the same year.\n Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Draper.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to turn first to the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the term \"willfully\" and its determination that the case had to be remanded for further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore Petitioners' communications with their counsel. We ask this Court to find that there is no necessity for any such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege because summary judgment should have been affirmed in this case. Petitioners and their counsel, if you think about what communications you might find, they could not have known anything more about these statutory issues of first impression than the district court did. It's questions of law. And if the district court's opinion does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the, of the FCRA. The first   the Ninth Circuit nevertheless reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to go ahead and look at privileged communications if the Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully. And the first is that they read willfully in this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several cases where this Court has read the term willfully in civil statutes to mean recklessly. But this Court has said repeatedly that the word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used to determine whether it means with knowledge that your conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations are sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike the other three that were at issue, Congress has used the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean, as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that their conduct violates the Act.\n Well, it's also used in the phrase \"knowing and willfully.\" That appears in several other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.\n Well, it actually says \"willfully and knowingly  \"\n In one formulation or another, but it combines the two words, knowing and willful.\n Well, this Court, though, has held that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is used together, it's been discussed in a number of cases including Dixon recently, that it means   willfully means knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts. And that would make perfect sense in this setting, and so the term willfully when, again, used  \n You mean willfully alone?\n It  \n Where   where it   where it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, that does not mean knowing the facts? If you mistake the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?\n Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and the Court held that it meant that you knew that your conduct violated the law. And that seems to be the most reasonable reading here because if you look, there are also sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing conduct, and that would require the conclusion that Congress used willfully in this section to mean a   a less   a more   a less culpable mens rea than knowingly. And that's  \n So that if you're the CEO of your company, and a lawyer   Federal counsel comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we need to make an important decision about whether we are complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I don't want to know about it. That would not be willfully violating the statute?\n Well, under   some cases have suggested that there could be a willful blindness instruction that would govern whether you define that as knowing or not. Certainly  \n So it doesn't have to be actual knowledge?\n I think that the best reading of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is, that is everything but, you know, that really is  \n How about reckless disregard?\n Well, conscious disregard is a recklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit correctly determined that this should be interpreted as a recklessness standard, this Court has defined recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious disregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of   of harm or in this case illegality. And in these circumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk of illegality because what the district court found is that the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute were actually not only reasonable, but correct, and having  \n Since the term knowingly or knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer from that that willfully in that provision also means something different?\n I think the way it's used, it says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a permissible purpose. Permissible purpose, that may not be knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that your purpose wasn't permissible. And even if they were using it  \n I thought the statute says what the permissible purposes are.\n It does, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what the statute said. Because for instance, users are told what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit report from, from a credit agency. But more importantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the term knowingly there can also be explained. If you look at Section 1681h, it actually provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions that are carved out in 1681n. And so I think it was to make clear, I think it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a willful intent to injure. So even if they meant it to be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just surplusage. It was to clarify that they didn't have to have a willful intent to violate.\n Would you say it's all right to use the model penal code definition of reckless, which is basically what you   taking it here, you would have to consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n If you come across anything that would use that, I mean \"reckless\" itself is unclear. The model penal code tried to clarify it based on this Court's opinions primarily.\n But I think you can look to the way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs. Brennan as well, though, as well as  \n What's the difference?\n The difference is just, there is two forms of recklessness. One which says that if the risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have known, you could be   you could be liable. But that the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used here in this setting, where there is the potential for very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to   Farmer versus Brennan calls it \"criminal,\" the criminal recklessness standard. And that means that not only do you have to have an objectively high risk of illegality, but you must be actually conscious of that risk. But in this case, you don't even need to get to the issue of consciousness.\n Well, you said there is no way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here. I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers. They know there's risk that this is unlawful.\n The question is  \n But consciousness, I mean, maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't know that that would help you.\n I think the issue of conscious   the risk, though, it has to be a high risk. And if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or even if it is an interpretation of the statute that is fairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of success, then how can you say that is a high risk of illegality, so high that we should say that Congress wanted to sanction you for taking that position? And for saying that, you know, you shouldn't be permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was a fair ground for believing that it was lawful. And here what the Ninth Circuit did  \n Suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful. Lawyers are in disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it. Is that a willful violation?\n I don't, I don't think so, Your Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for    \n But I think I'm violating.\n I don't   yes. But you couldn't know you were violating it, and because if it really is a fair ground for litigation  \n I'm a better lawyer than my advisors. (Laughter.)\n Your Honor, I think if it's an area where the law is truly unsettled. And here an issue of first impression, a lawyer's assessment that you may lose is inherently predictive. These are not true or false answers when there is almost nothing to go on. And so in that area, it's much like what this Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a case involving a willful violation of, or interference with rights secured by   by Federal law. And what the Court says, well, it's not just any bad purpose that Congress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy announced rules of law. They have to be, there has to be sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a high risk of illegality that you could disregard.\n Would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all?\n Only  \n Or would you just look to the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation, it was a close question; it's okay?\n I don't think you would look at the intent until you found that there   there was no reasonable ground or at least no, no   no fair ground for debate about the question. And at that point, Your Honor, if there was an objectively high risk of illegality, then you do have to ask, what were they consciously aware of; what did they do?\n I must say that   that is not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating the law.\n Well, I think in Screws  \n You're changing it to mean willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.\n I don't think so.\n I mean, if I know that what I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating the law.\n Your Honor, Screws says you can't know the unknowable. And if the law, if it's really, truly an issue of first impression, you may think you're violating the law, but you   you can't know the unknowable. And that's why this setting is so important, because you can't, you know, put   impose sanctions. Here we're talking about the potential for an industry facing billions of dollars without any actual harm to   to individuals. And that  \n Is it really billions? How many of these have been certified as class actions?\n I believe that there are two certified class actions. But many   there are many cases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your Honor. Certainly if the classes are certified, and  \n Would you, would you, as representative of the insurers, would you have a sound objection to class action certification in these cases?\n Your Honor, I'm sure there would be some bases to resist. But classes have been certified, so I  \n And gone to, gone to judgment?\n I do not believe any have gone to judgment, but I don't, I don't   I think that the point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every consumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they may have gotten a better price if they had even better credit, across the country, if you interpret the statute that way, and then you can say you can get this thousand dollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply that by the number of consumers, then you certainly have the potential for very, very substantial liability.\n It's a question how many will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation costs.\n Well, given that these are proceeding as class actions, the answer is there is plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys to bring these class actions, and they have been brought, and this is a class action. There are two class actions.\n They haven't   neither has been certified, has it?\n No, it has not. They are putative class actions, Your Honor. But I, but I think that whether it's a class action or not, we have to look at what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive damages based on a willful violation in a technical area where there is no potential for harm? And certainly  \n I have just two, two questions on, on willful and then   because you may want to talk about the other issue in the case. First, you began by saying that here a district judge has come to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be reckless. Do you have any authority, where we   for that proposition, where we have said that?\n Well  \n We find all the time that a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so forth   and disregard what I just said. That's my first question. And the second is willfully, as Screws itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.\n Except Screws, Your Honor, actually says that it was adopting a criminal recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a reckless standard. And that is the same standard that has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully in the punitive damages context. So I think it's exactly the same standard in that Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't just be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad purpose to violate clearly defined rules. And this Court has said in various contexts in the, in the qualified immunity area that picking the losing side does not mean that your conduct was objectively, you know, wrongful. And that's really   I think that there is great significance to the district court's ruling. I'm not saying that in every case, it would absolutely be dispositive. I think you have to look at what was the, you know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning of the district court. But what the Ninth Circuit did is that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on creative but unlikely answers to issues of first impression. Well, if an administration official goes to a lawyer in the administration and asks about a course of conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue of first impression, there is probably a 40 percent chance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed on that basis?\n Well, just because an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's a high degree of uncertainty. The statute may be clearly addressed to that issue. It hasn't come up before.\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n First impression.\n It certainly   this Court has made clear that if the language of the statute is very plain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be adequate warning. But certainly this statute doesn't satisfy that standard. Congress didn't provide the benchmarks that you have to use for comparison to determine whether there has been an increase in a charge or whether there has been an adverse action based on the consumer report. You need benchmarks to answer those questions, and there aren't any regulations and there were no cases. If I could save the balance of my time for rebuttal.\n Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Millett.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals correctly concluded that willfulness in the civil context, as is used here, includes a reckless disregard component or a recklessness component. That is what this Court has held in a number of cases that have similar uses of willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have held. Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the three that have been most discussed in the case, in the papers here. But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here was in the application of that standard. And in particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it concluded that a creative but unlikely position constitutes recklessness, it erred. Recklessness speaks an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care. It requires that the defendant act in the face of or fail to act  \n It is a subjective standard or an objective standard?\n It has both in this context. It is, I think, first and foremost, an objective component, because there is   this is a civil case. It's not purely subjective. And that objective component is very important because that is what makes the act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk. There has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.\n So if the potential liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to be even more careful because there is liability so great. So is it the greater the liability   the greater chance of recklessness, the greater the potential liability?\n No, to the extent you're talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's true. I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury that could result, can   we'll tolerate less risk. If the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to somebody, we'll   the law will tolerate a lesser degree of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or maybe even a dollar injury. And it's not set. It's a variable calculation. So in that sense, it is. I don't think that when we talk about a high and objective risk in this context, we are talking about the dollars that a, that a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers. What we are talking about here   and this is a very unusual statute the way it's written   the liability itself, not just the damages, but the liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from law. You have to   there is no recovery here like there is in almost   or commonly in Federal statutes for just a violation. That isn't it. You have to show either a willful violation or a negligent violation, and that requires a determination not only that the defendants violated the law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how many standard deviations from correct their position was and that is an objective determination. Once an objectively high risk has been found by a court, then   then the case can shift to looking into subjective things. I think a plaintiff would be entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to infer the existence of willfulness from that. And that's often when defendants   I'm sorry.\n May I also ask, do you agree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse action?\n No, we agree with Respondents on the meaning of adverse action.\n Correct me if I'm wrong. You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your rates, that's an adverse action because they might have lowered the rates even further if they had notified me about the credit report and there were some errors in it?\n Right. It's a complicated answer, in part because that assumes that you have an existing account and you're not an initial account here. And when you have an existing account, there's a definition of adverse action for insurance provisions, but in iv there is a separate, there's another definition, and this is on, on page   sorry. Excuse me. On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under big I   I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions   talks about reviewing an existing account, and it cross-referenced another provision which talks about reviewing an account for purposes of termination. And that would include, in our view, not only completely canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. So which would govern in that particular context is a little bit harder. But it could, and here's logically why, because I think the understanding of \"increase\" that's at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation of this statute, and that is, did the content of your information in your credit report, if it had been better, could you have had a better rate or a better deal.\n Right.\n So have you been hit in the pocketbook.\n So if they lower, if they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the meaning of adverse action because they might have lowered them further if the information hadn't been erroneous?\n It could have, and here   in this sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off, but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of my gender or because of my credit report, it's an adverse action. So the fact that you're doing somewhat better doesn't mean  \n That isn't how the statute defines it.\n Excuse me?\n The statute says an adverse action is an increase in a charge for   in connection with underwriting.\n But it also  \n That's what it says. And then it says an increase is   and if you take an adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your increase is based in whole or in part on information contained in a consumer report, you have to send the thing. How did you get   in your example, there was no increase. I mean, in a charge. In your salary, it's a decrease in the salary. Same thing.\n The definition again on 3A includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable change in the terms. And so it's not settled whether  \n You mean unfavorable change in terms, unfavorable change in terms.\n Exactly.\n Well, suppose you don't have, you don't have any terms because you never did it before. There's no change in terms.\n If you're a new customer   and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to existing accounts is complicated  \n You mean those words \"change in terms\" refer to rates, in other words? That's a rather odd way to refer to it. In one place, you refer to an \"increase\"; in the other place, you'd refer to it as a \"change in terms.\" That's sort of an odd way to write a statute.\n Well, you can have a change in terms that is not necessarily an increase. It could be you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when your car is in for repair for some reason. That's not an increase.\n No, no, I understand that. But what we're after is this. Everybody has a credit report, just about. You put it in and you give people the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you know that maybe there could have still been a better rate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to send notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's basically the argument. So what's your response?\n And Justice Breyer, my response is that if the content of the information in your credit report would have made you   had it been better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the content of the information, then you had an adverse action.\n Okay, so your response is just to repeat my question and say that's right?\n No. If I could continue on that, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way insurance companies work is they don't have 3 million customers and 3 million rates. They have ranges and most of them will have a top tier. They may have specialized things for employees, but putting aside a specialized category, there's a top range and they will tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15 percent of people fit in there. So they know what the best rate is. They know what the next, above average rate, the standard rate.\n How do you fit, how do you fit that within the language of the statute? Is it, I fail   you're a first- time customer and I fail to give you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had. Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance? No. Is it an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance? Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any insurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into that language.\n Well, to begin with, that may be why Petitioners' position here certainly was not reckless and the Ninth Circuit erred. But we do think that the statutory language read as a whole supports this. It could be a denial of a particular term in an insurance contract. But you have to look at   it's important to understand you look  \n I read the term as, as one of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate. The earlier part refers to the rate. An increase in any charge for, that's the rate. And then it speaks of change in the terms of coverage. I mean, that is, you know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of the insurance, whether you're insured for  \n Or it could be a reduction in the terms. I mean, these things are statutory construction issues to be litigated, and the important issue here   and they are presented in this case. They're to be litigated and the important issue is that when there is fair debate about these issues insurance companies will not be held to be willfully violating the statute if they got the answer wrong. But I think on the, on the substantive question, it's important to read \"adverse action\" in light of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light of the definition of when a notice is required to be issued, which turns upon the content of the information in the report. Thank you.\n Which is where?\n And that's on page 6a on our appendix.\n Thank you.\n Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shorr.\n Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When Congress intended to require a knowing violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly said so. It did not do so in connection with the claims here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A). In each instance where Congress wanted to allow   to require a higher mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with liability that was greater. They required knowing mens rea for the criminal provision. They required knowing mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages that are available under the act.\n What do you say to the argument from drafting history that looks at the history both of little n and little o and it points out that as originally, in the original bill, little o providing for the actual damages required a finding of gross negligence? Little n used the word \"willful\" just as it does now, suggesting that willful would not include gross negligence or something close to gross negligence like recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed whatever it always was, and if the argument from contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was changed to negligence in o. What do you say to that argument?\n Justice Souther, I think the only thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence to negligence. I don't think that tells us much about willful means, what willful means as a separate matter.\n But the fact that they had originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about what they had in mind in n. And they must have had something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n which was a standard higher than gross negligence.\n No, Justice Souter, I suggest that what you can infer from that is that, if anything, is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence in that circumstance. But that still doesn't tell us separately what \"willful\" meant, and of course \"willful\" had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless disregard. And I respectfully disagree with  \n Well, I mean, there's no question it has been and that is sort of the usual reading in the civil context. But we also keep repeating, you know, \"willful\" is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context. And here the argument is that if you look to the context of the, of the two statutory sections right up next to each other, you can draw a, an inference about what \"willful\" means.\n I think if anything, Justice Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly required the knowing standard and that's a knowing violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. And the statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is under this law. So that reference to knowing could not refer to a knowing, knowing the facts. And of course, willful in some sense always includes some knowledge of the factual circumstances. In addition, the logical structure of the act   as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual damages. We have a reckless standard, a knowing or reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but then an even higher level for the criminal and higher statutory penalty provisions. And as I started to say, a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and other similar cases.\n Counsel, even if you're right about the standard, how can you suggest that it's willful here when you have no judicial construction, you have no administrative construction, you have the statutory language that at least the questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly clear? How can you suggest that the action of the companies on this case even under your standard was willful?\n Mr. Chief Justice, of course we believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not need further interpretation by the Court.\n So if we don't agree with you on that, you would lose on the application of the willfulness standard?\n If you don't agree with us  \n In other words, your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful violation depends upon your assertion that the statute is perfectly clear?\n I think that there is a level of objective component that the statute at least has to be understood by a reasonable person at some level using standard statutory construction. But that isn't to suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a higher court or even a district court for counsel to get guidance. And of course, in this case, there was no guidance supporting Respondents   excuse me   no guidance supporting Petitioners', defendants', position. In fact, the only guidance supported our position, including guidance from the FTC.\n You're talking about the Ball letter?\n I am talking about the Ball letter.\n That wasn't even binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded as authoritative?\n It was not, and we are not suggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron deference. But if you get past the minimal level of objective standard, the question becomes what indicia and markers were out there that would have guided this company as to whether there was a high risk that they were violating the act. And certainly the Ball letter, which was sent by the staff specifically to address this exact question and to guide insurance companies, gave notice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than the best available rate based on their credit score was an adverse action. And in addition, there was  \n Well, how could that be? I mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's clear the other way. That is, if you look at the language, as you've just heard, if you look at the purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an instance where a person has continuous accidents. He's a reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in just a category below the bottom and they read his credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he always pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not to the top category, but they give him a much better deal. And you're saying this statute means that what I just described is an adverse action based on a credit report?\n Yes.\n Yes. Okay. And then if you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and then in light of the following: The little boy who says wolf. You're probably puzzled what I mean by that. I mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there will be tens of millions of notices going out and they'll have the same effect on the public that these privacy notices have today. We get them every day, dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, because they will become meaningless because to an average person that notice will not mean that he better look at his credit report. It will mean throw it in the wastebasket. All right, now I've got the purpose, I've got the language, and I have what I think of as common sense. Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.\n This is a different question. We've been talking about willful up to now.\n Yes, and this is the adverse action question.\n You haven't addressed adverse action at all.\n And I'm happy to do so now.\n Yes. But, was there anything further on willful? You said that the statute was clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice, but now we know that courts have divided on this question, right? On  \n Divided in the sense   well, the Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district court's ruling so there's no current division, but if that's what you mean, yes, Your Honor. In a   I guess I'll address quickly your question. There's additional guidance provided by the FTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was 16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that instance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and comment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined very broadly and it includes any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact. And that plays in the subjective aspect as well, but addressing your question, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory language  \n It's pretty sloppy lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be considered to have   wow. This is a standard?\n That was  \n Any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact.\n That was guidance, Your Honor.\n This is guidance?\n That was guidance. That was guidance to provide in the context of reading this statute, it should be read broadly.\n But you know, I would tell my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.\n In addition, the CEO would have the guidance provided by the Ball letter. But again addressing your question, Justice Breyer, an increase based on credit, if we had let's say an increase based on race, someone goes in and has a product to buy and there's the best rate, and they charge someone else based on their race a higher rate, certainly that's an increase based on credit. There's only one best rate.\n But this is not an antidiscrimination provision. It doesn't say anyone who discriminates in the setting of race has to send out letters. It requires an adverse action. It requires an increase in the charge.\n And Your Honor, I was only using that example to try and explain the statutory language.\n It doesn't explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race, of course that's an increase based on race.\n Well, here we have  \n And if you refuse to give a person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based on race. That is discrimination based on race.\n You're charging someone more based on credit.\n That's true, and it's a discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. You decreased it.\n I think  \n It's still a discrimination, it's still unlawful.\n Applying it to credit, a natural definition that is charging someone more than you charge others is an increase.\n When you say more, in order for there to be an adverse action there has to be an increase or an unfavorable change. And when you have an initial application you have to figure out what is the baseline in order to determine whether there has been an increase or an adverse action. And you and the Solicitor General just assert that the baseline in that situation is the best possible rate that you can get, but I don't understand where that comes from.\n Because charging someone more than someone else who qualifies for that better rate based on their credit, is increasing them, charging them more, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose, which I think was a question you asked  \n Let me look at the language. Go back to give me   because in ordinary English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase, but maybe there is a technical term in the technical language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word increase means decrease. And if you   is there anything you want   no. It's a serious question, at least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses this word increase in the way you just suggested.\n We believe that it's a standard dictionary definition, to charge someone more for insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is increasing their charge.\n Which dictionary shall I look at?\n I think we can look at any dictionary. I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but  \n They're making this argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago when you alluded to statutory purpose. I think this is what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong. One purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the consumer's credit report may contain errors which are doing the consumer some kind of damage.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n And you want this consumer alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and correct it if possible.\n That's exactly right.\n Reading the adverse action the way you read it, it would give the consumer or consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. In every case in which the consumer might have done better if the credit report had assumed different facts, on your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say I want to look at that report and correct it if it's wrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the fallacy of saying because that is one object of the statute, every term within the statute has got to be read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that object? And the trouble that we're having on the bench is that discrimination and increase are different terms. Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination does not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the basis of your argument?\n I think it has to be an increase based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to that statutory purpose is an increase above what you would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit and of course  \n Well, that's a way to give every conceivable effect to that policy. But the statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer described. Everybody will be getting notices and the notices will be meaningless.\n I don't think the notice is problematic because you're alerting the consumer to check that the information that the insurance company expressly relied on to increase your charge  \n To set the charge. I mean, that's circular. To set the charge that it gives you.\n I don't think you need a prior charge to suffer an increase. If I walk into a candy store and I've never purchased that candy before but the best price that day is 5 cents but they say we're going to charge you 10 cents, I've certainly suffered an increase.\n By that you're talking linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose. So I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and that's about 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't have the best possible credit score. Now I take it that means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that, since it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people. And if that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out notices. And that's why I asked my question about the boy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive, that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on that?\n Sure. The   as an initial matter, it's not the perfect credit that is the standard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's best rate. And that's a much broader standard. We don't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA 6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six. And of course not everyone is going to get the notice. If your driving record totally eliminates   if you have great credit but your driving record eliminates the possibility that you qualify for the better rate, you wouldn't get notice in that circumstance either. But the key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but the information that the insurance company looks at is incorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect information without ever having the opportunity to tell the insurance company or whoever is collecting that information for them, you've charged me the wrong amount and I in fact qualify for that better rate.\n Don't you have that right independently, though, every year to look at a copy of your credit report?\n Well, what's significant here, that has been added to the statute in the last two years. But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving notice at a critical time, when the insurance company tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an adverse action. I wanted to also mention, here it's not just an increase. There's also been a denial, and that Mr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied insurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so that is also an adverse action under the act.\n When you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate, why is that? Why wouldn't you look at it relative to say the average insured who walks in the door?\n Because that   GEICO's argument, and I think that's what they want, presumes they're looking at accurate credit information. And the problem is, Congress has always told that there is significant inadequacy in the credit information. I think it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center brief. In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate in consumer information was 50 percent and there was a 20 percent serious error in the rates. Under GEICO's interpretation  \n I don't understand what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?\n Because under GEICO's theory of the statute you may never get notice, even though you're being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate information, as long as you're not charge   your charge doesn't move below average. So a lot of people who are in fact intended to be protected under this act will not be protected until their charge goes below average, even though the insurance company is continuing to charge them more based on inaccurate information.\n Why do we   how do we know that they were intended to be protected in this way by getting this notice? That's the issue in the case.\n Because going through the statute and the increase based on credit, and then the notice will give them the opportunity to check. Since the consumer here is the   it's a system of checks and balances, and unless you give this consumer the opportunity to check that they are in fact using the correct information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't driven down by identity theft, you can continue to charge people more  \n Okay. So that's  \n   based on inaccurate information.\n Your basic argument is the statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer to ask to see his credit report. That's your basic premise?\n Both based on the premise and purpose of statute, yes.\n All right.\n Briefly addressing the application of the standard to the facts in this case, we do think it's appropriate to remand for further consideration in light of some new developments. GEICO has just recently produced documents to us that addressly   directly address the question of scienter here, so if there's   if you go past a minimum threshold  \n I've read your reference to those documents. Explain why you think that's so important.\n Because those documents directly address the subject of standard here, that GEICO was reckless or understood their  \n How do those documents shed any light on recklessness? I didn't see that.\n I'm sorry, Your Honor?\n How do the documents that you describe shed any light on the extent of their recklessness, if any?\n I want to be careful, because I had presented   I asked to lodge them with the Court and I can quote them if necessary, but within those documents there is direct evidence that GEICO interpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not putting someone in the best tier based on credit  \n Who's GEICO? I mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law means. If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I think you could read it this way, does that mean that GEICO reads it that way?\n No, Your Honor. In this instance, this document involves top level GEICO executives. And with respect to the advice of counsel issue, frankly it's a red herring. We have never asked to compel the Defendants in either of these cases or any of the cases we're involved in, to waive their privilege. They've got the right, of course, to offer advice of counsel as an affirmative   as a defense in this case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove our case to even reach what the counsel said. We believe we can prove our case based on the documents and subjective intent alone.\n I still don't really understand this part of the case very much. Assume that a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three different ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous, and we think the government's reading is the better reading. And the executives think about it and they say no, we don't think that's right. Has that proved reckless disregard?\n If the statute was clear and the guidance  \n If the statute's clear. And of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge thought it was clear, but the other way.\n And with respect to the district court, we believe the district court here clearly erred, as the Ninth Circuit found. And the guidance   that opinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at issue here. The only guidance, again, available at the time supported our reading of the statute. There was no guidance from and court or from the FTC, or from anywhere that would have supported Defendants' interpretation at that time. So that's another aspect of inquiry, the subjective intent of the Defendants. If there are no other questions?\n Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.\n If I could start by just responding to the issue of the new document, I just want to emphasize that this document was created by people who weren't lawyers. It was done before GEICO even started using credit to price insurance. They were   said they were brainstorming about what the statute might mean. And I would point the Court to the supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO implemented the policy that we're talking about here, the   they said that the intent was that we would send to the people who were supposed to get the adverse action notice. With the early systems development we didn't have the ability to identify whether they were supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because they had not yet developed the way to do with what they call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't taken credit into account at all. And this is a procedure that's required actually in most States in order to ensure that those who don't want to allow access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning of those State laws, and that means worse than the average loss ratio. So there's nothing in this record, even if you take into account the documents they're talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law. With respect to a few of the factual or   issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately 80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new insurance to now have to get notice under the standards established by the Ninth Circuit. With respect to who can qualify for the top tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO, approximately 10 percent. So 90 percent of the consumers would not qualify for that. And the statute very plainly does not prohibit differential treatment based on persons with better credit, nor do State laws. And so the analogy as to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you can't treat any person of a different race in a different way, and that's not true under this statute. And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't   if we're treating you worse than we would have treated you if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll send you the notice.\n Why did they use credit reports? Is it just a hedge against late premiums and the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk factors generally?\n Well, generally there are about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a good credit history is generally regarded as responsible, and responsible people tend to make less claims. And so, again, it's just one factor of 15 though.\n Yeah. May I ask this question? The reading of the statute in subsection i about, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to favor your view. But subsection ii about denial of employment really seems to read in favor of the government's reading.\n Well actually, I think that when you factor in employment, it has   it has the opposite effect. Because what happens here is if you're using employment verification reports, consumer reports about employment, there are all kinds of consumer reports. How do you tell who had the optimal employment history? How could the baseline be the best employment history possible?\n No. But my point is, it seems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems like the first applicant would be an adverse employment action under subparagraph ii, just   do you see what I'm trying to say?\n That if you   that in other words, if you gave someone a lower salary  \n It adversely affects any current or prospective employee. Now the language in i isn't, it doesn't read that way. But the thing that's troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the light of what ii seems to say.\n Your Honor, I think that if GEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less because you looked at their credit report, then GEICO would concede that that is in fact an adverse action. So I don't think it's inconsistent at all. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Thank you, Miss Mahoney. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that it wanted the Department of Labor to define the boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship services exemption. And I think that has two important implications for this case. First of all, when the Department has filled in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as they are permissible implementation of the statute. Second, and particularly specific to this case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one. And here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by far the most sensible one. Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to the second issue first, because I think that's the source of a lot of the concern in this case. Plainly the two regulations, section 10   552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down the present regulation, have some inconsistency between them. But it is also plain that the Department could not have intended to say at one and the same time that the only employers entitled use the exemption were homeowners and then say in another section promulgated at the same time that also third-party employers are entitled to the exemption. So the question is, how does one resolve this apparent inconsistency? And the Secretary says, well, the only regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals specifically with the issue of third-party employment is 552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party Employment. And that section 552.3, while containing some language that might be read to address that issue, in fact deals with several other topics. Specifically it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are involved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs, footmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in a private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in the private home of the person receiving the services. So it's not enough, for example, for somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby sitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the house of the person receiving the services.\n I thought the words were home of the person who employs, not who receives the services but who employs.\n Oh, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. The literal language is not specifically what I was saying. What I'm talking about is the Secretary's attempt to resolve what is an apparent inconsistency between the literal language in 552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).\n By   reading out the words \"of the person who employs\" her?\n Well, essentially reading them to say they, they were not intended to address directly the subject of third party employment which is the subject addressed in 109(a). And I think if one is   even leaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary for a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking about making a fair resolution of these conflicting provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first thing that one would do is apply the canon that the specific provision controls the general. And if one looks at the two provisions, section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing and one thing only: that is third party employment. And it says explicitly and straight out that persons who are employed by third-party employers are   or third-party employers who employ persons performing domestic services are entitled to the exemption.\n I thought it also addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just people who have companionship services. So if you have a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.\n That would be true. Now that would be inapplicable  \n What's a footman? I don't even know what a footman is. (Laughter.)\n What is a footman?\n I think that may be beyond my expertise, Justice Scalia. The   of course that doesn't address anything beyond companionship services, of course, because there is not an exemption beyond that. And that's one of the interesting things about 552.3. In addition to generally dealing with this question of what kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion of the exemption for companionship services, because jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not subject to the exemption. So it really looking at what 552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that   at the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as well. And the Department has taken that position. It says this is, in fact, the only definition of domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it is not just intended to be limited to the particular situation of the exemption. It applies more broadly than that to coverage as well. So I think in all those senses, Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3 deals with a number of other subjects. Now, one other thing on the statutory interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that Respondent offers also leads to the problem that essentially sets up a tension with another one of the regulations which is 552.101(a). 552.101(a) which I'm sorry   I don't have the right page number here   it is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition   has, carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to. But then it also says that this includes people who are commonly referred to as private household workers. And the one thing we know from the Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and also from what the Department has said before this Court is that that term at the time was defined by the Department and known by Congress to constitute more than just employees employed by the homeowner. There was a special second category for people who worked in the home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but were employed by a third party agency. Now somewhere underlying all of this question, I think, is statutory interpretation and indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to employees who work for third parties. And I would just like to suggest that there really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have wanted that. First of all, third participate employers such as private agencies provide services for the particular group of people which Congress was trying to assist with this exemption. People who by reason of age or disability are unable to care for themselves. Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the background screening for employees. They can provide necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents and things like that. So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit unusual.\n Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).\n Uh-huh. Yes, Your Honor.\n Page 77a as you said. But what is your argument there? I mean, that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision that you say we should ignore or at least should accept the Secretary's reinterpretation of.\n Well perhaps, perhaps I wasn't as clear as I intended to be. It does, as I indicated, have the language about the private home of the employer.\n That's right.\n However, the   the preceding sentence says the term, referring to the term that is at issue in 552.3, domestic service employment, includes persons who are frequently referred to as private household workers. The fact is that those two statements are inconsistent with each other. The term cannot be limited to employees of the home owner and also include persons who are frequently referred to as private household workers, at least if one means all the persons referred to  \n Yeah. I see. Is that clear in the   in the specific Senate report that is referred to here?\n In the specific Senate report, in both the '73 and the '74 reports  \n This, the one that's cited in the regulation itself. Because I   otherwise, I don't, I ignore those things. That's cited in the regulation. Does that report say it?\n What? The report uses the term private households workers frequently interchangeably with the term domestic employees. That is what is clear from the report itself. Now, the Department of Labor when it was reporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to do, the Department of Labor used the term private households workers, specifically defined in there by the Department, to say this means not just employees employed by the homeowner but also people who are employed by third parties. So I think it is a fair assumption that when the Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it in the same manner that the Department of Labor reports have. And, in fact, at one point in the   moving further backward in the legislative history, Senator Dominick actually quoted that language, the definition from the Department of Labor, on the Senate floor during the debates.\n I thought that the Department of Labor's first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to third-party employers. That was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't it?\n No, Justice Ginsburg. I believe that's correct. There was a, an opinion letter from the Department in November of 1975   this is an opinion letter that's cited at page 21 of the Solicitor General's brief   which specifically stated that the exemption applied whether the employee was an employee of the homeowner or of a public or private  \n I'm referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock. I thought the original notice and comment rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to third-party employers.\n I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I misunderstood the time frame we were dealing with. In the notice of proposed rulemaking, actually I would disagree with that characterization also. The notice of proposed rulemaking made a division among third-party employers. It said the exemption would not be available to those third-party employers who were covered enterprises but it would be available to those who were not covered enterprises.\n Well, wait. Does the notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's position?\n No, it does not.\n I didn't think it did. They're just floating an idea. You know  \n That's correct.\n Run it up the flagpole, see if  \n Well, that it solicited comments on that proposal. And after the comments, it changed its position to say no, in fact, all third-party employers will be exempt.\n And   and there was no further discussion of it after   after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?\n Yes, if I can just   if I can quibble with the premise of the question. The first time it said some third-party employers would be exempt and some wouldn't. Then when it changed  \n Some would be the ones that qualified as   what is the phrase, enterprises engaged in commerce?\n That's correct   those would be the ones under the proposed rulemaking that would have been denied the exemption. When in fact   when, in fact, the Labor Department said no, in fact, the exemption should apply to all third-party employers, it said it found that more consistent with the statutory language. And it also said it was more consistent with what it had done under other regulations which had been passed under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n Mr. Farr, would you agree that the position expressed in the notice itself would have   in the original notice would have been consistent with the statutory language?\n I'm not sure of that, Justice Stevens, to be honest with you. I mean one of the difficulties here in answering that is that I think, because the Department has such broad authority under 213(a)(15) to define and delimit the term, I think what's consistent with the statute has expanded somewhat. On the other hand, I have to say I don't really see where there would be in the language of the statute any basis for drawing a distinction between different kinds of third-party employers. The phraseology in the coverage provisions, the phraseology in the exemption provisions, really doesn't allow for that in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation.\n Well there would be a basis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.\n I mean, it's possible, but as I say, the   I mean, among the difficulties that covered enterprises is not just corporations and big and small corporations. Covered enterprises beginning in 1974 includes state and local governments. So what Congress would have been addressing here, if it had been squarely facing the issue, would have not just been the question of how to treat large and small corporations, but whether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered enterprises such as state and local agencies who, in fact, do provide a lot of the direct employees who provide companionship care. They have a lot of employees who actually go into homes and care for people who are employed by state and local governments. And I think it would be a little bit unusual for Congress, who is reasonably solicitous of state interests, to deny them an exemption that would have been of considerable importance to them. As the State of   or the City of New York brief points out, this is a very extensive endeavor.\n Were they covered before, before there was any provision that dealt with household workers? If state and localities were considered enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they were   they had no exemption before, their companion care people, just as household workers, would be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n No, but I think, Justice Ginsburg, the important point is they were not covered prior to 1974. There were certain  \n They were not treated as covered enterprises.\n That's correct. They were   they were, if they worked in schools or institutions like hospitals. Other than that, they were not until 1974. That's exactly correct. This, in fact, would have been denying them an exception at the very time that for other occupations aside from companionship services, they were first having coverage applied to them. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n Thank you Mr. Farr. Mr. Salmons.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The FLSA's companionship services exemption applies by its terms to any employee employed in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for the aged or infirm. The Act imposes no limitation based on the identity of the employer. And the Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the exception to employees of third parties is entitled to deference. The Department expressly invoked its statutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109, 552.109. It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking procedures both in 1975 and each time it considered amending the regulation. And States and care providers have relied upon it in devising systems to provide appropriate services to the aged and the infirm.\n So if the Department of Labor had enacted its regulations as originally proposed, those regulations would have been invalid?\n No, I don't think so, Your Honor. If you're referring to the initial proposed rulemaking that would have exempted only some third parties, we think that would have been a permissible reading of the exemption given the fact that the Secretary is provided very broad defined limit authority. But we certainly think there's nothing in that exemption that precludes the construction that's been adopted here. In fact, we think it is the most consistent with that language. The language of 5523 upon which Respondent relies does not change that conclusion. While if read in isolation that language could require that domestic service employees have to provide their services in the home of the employer, it should be not   it should not be given that reading for the reasons explained in the Department's 2005 advisory memorandum. The Department's construction of its own regulations contained in that memorandum is itself entitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and its construction harmonizes the various provisions at issue here far better than Respondent's reading of 553 does.\n The statute treats together babysitters and elder care people, but I take it the babysitters if they were working for an agency rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any exemption? Is that right?\n That's correct, and that's tied to a specific term that only applies to the exemption as to babysitters. The only thing that's exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a casual basis. Congress certainly could have included a casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption for companionship services. We think it's very notable that it did not and we read from that that Congress wanted all domestic service employees providing companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those individuals who most need this type of care have the opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.\n Isn't it odd that this   the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were not covered before. So it added household workers. And yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on adding people, it also subtracted people who were covered before, took them out, removed them from the coverage of the Act.\n Well, we think that that is the consequence of the companionship services exemption, but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is and based on the textual difference between, for example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the exemption for companionship services. The exemption here expresses no limitation based on the identity of the employer and we think it was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that what Congress had in mind here was a categorical exemption based on the type of services that are being provided; and while that may mean that there are certain workers who are now exempt who were not previously exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in 1974 focused on this problem of companionship services being provided to those who cannot care for themselves; and we think that follows from the text, and for the reasons Congress adopted that.\n Mr. Salmons, can I ask you a question about the importance of the whole litigation. Am I correct in believing that there's a provision in the law that protects the defendants from damages liability if they relied in good faith on the regulation, so that what we're really talking about is whether the regulation would apply in the future rather than there being a damage issue in the case?\n Well, there is a safe harbor provision that allows for reliance by employers on a statement by the agency.\n That would clearly apply to this case, would it not?\n We certainly think it would. I take it Respondents in this case would disagree and would point to the language of 552.3. I'm not sure, for example, how the Second Circuit would have resolved that question, given the way it viewed the statute here. But we do think that that would apply and so I think one view of that would be it's largely prospective.\n So in your view we're really faced with a question of whether the regulation should be given prospective effect.\n I'm sorry? What would be given prospective effect?\n As to whether the Government's position should be given prospective effect because the past liability doesn't   the damage liability just doesn't exist.\n Well, that is our view. Again, I think that would be an issue that would be litigated and I'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds of cases that are being filed under this provision. And I think it's   one of the concerns I think of the agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the regulation are to be reconciled and applied.\n Not seemingly conflicted. They conflict.\n Well, I certainly don't take issue with that. I think that there are a variety of things that point to the conclusion that the language in 552.3 that refers to \"in the home of the employer\" simply cannot be read literally. It was borrowed from the Social Security context and if read the way Respondents do we think would raise a serious question about the scope of coverage because the agency has always viewed 552.3, notwithstanding the initial line that says \"For purposes of the exemption,\" to provide the relevant definition for coverage as well. And no party, or amici for that matter, before this Court nor the Department thinks that there's a difference between the identity of the employer for purposes of coverage. And we also think, given the language in 101 that refers to private household workers, the definition of which was provided to Congress in a report by the Department of Labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum in 2005, which clearly applies to third party employers, suggests that 553 cannot be read literally. And of course we know that at the same time that the agency adopted 552.3 it felt the need to adopt a specific regulation dealing with the question of third-party employment which would not be relevant   which would not be necessary under Respondent's reading. If the Court has no further questions  \n Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Becker.\n Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: On October 1, 1974, just five months after the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took effect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated law-making function to define this term \"domestic service employment,\" which exists in the companionship exemption and nowhere else in the amendments. And they defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to companions and baby sitters employed by the household. At the same time, DOL provided a persuasive explanation for that definition. The Department found that such companions and baby sitters when employed by covered enterprises had been covered prior to the amendments and that it could not have been Congress' purpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to extend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage. The very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of the amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act. Therefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974 that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny the Act's protection to previously covered domestic service employees. The definition in 552.3, which expressly applies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with the final third-party regulation.\n Was that later?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n How much later?\n The final regulations were promulgated in February of 2005.\n No, no. I thought that the provision that was   what is the number   - where they say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many years later.\n No, no, Your Honor. That was in the final regulations, which were promulgated in February   excuse me   in 1975, not 2005.\n I mean, you read  \n In the final regulations.\n You read 3 and 3 says what you said it says. All right. How much later did they promulgate 109?\n That was in the final regulations in February of 75.\n The same time that 552.3 was finally promulgated.\n That's correct.\n They came out together, right?\n That's correct.\n That's what I thought. So the same day they say, 3, you have to have these domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick, and then in 109 they say you don't.\n That's correct. There's a direct conflict.\n All right. Now, why is that a conflict? Let's imagine   it sounds like a conflict. But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation that says birds for purposes of this are animals that fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way, penguins don't and they're still covered. I mean, why is that a conflict? There are lots of specific situations. If I read that, I would have thought, well, okay, they have an exception.\n Your Honor, the definitional regulation, 552.3, explicitly defines a term used only in the companionship services exemption, \"domestic service employment.\" And it defines it clearly and explicitly to apply only to employment by the household. Therefore, there is a direct conflict with the so-called third party employer regulation, which appears to say that the exemption can apply to employees employed by third parties. The importance of the conflict is twofold. One, when the original regulation was proposed the Department provided a persuasive explanation. Congress surely didn't intend to contract coverage in amendments designed explicitly to expand coverage.\n Did Congress intend to cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they live in their house, there's only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution. Their children hire a companion to look after them. Now, that's a third party.\n Your Honor, that question has been posed by some of the amici and it is a good question, but not the question before you.\n Because?\n And I submit that if the Department construed section 552.3 to say when our words say \"employed by the household\" that could include a broader notion of the household, for example a son or daughter living outside the household, that might be a permissible construction of the Department's own regulation. But the construction which simply takes those words  \n It doesn't say that. It says \"about, in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed.\" I live in San Francisco. My mother lives in Massachusetts. Now, if I hire a companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom she is employed. So if we're being literal and if you win this case, I don't see how   and I'm worried about this, obviously   however   and I think it's probably very common, that all over the country it's the family, the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so they don't have to be brought to an institution. And if you win this case, it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who will move to institutions. Now, if I were to say that that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a legal point because it's a question of what people intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the truth. It is a very worrisome point.\n It's a very important question of public policy and therefore let me answer in two ways. One, I think there is a proper procedure even under the existing regulations to address that concern. The elderly individual that you're concerned about who is severely disabled and thus needs this care, the child or family member who is employing the companion to care for them could do so as their guardian, and therefore as a technical legal matter would be doing so, the employment would be by the person who resides in the home.\n It wouldn't take a whole lot of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to his mother, who could then hire.\n Exactly.\n I mean, a clever lawyer would think of that, I think. (Laughter.)\n A clever lawyer could do this.\n And perhaps there are people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see through that kind of thing.\n But let me answer the second  \n And there are many   maybe Justice Scalia has the answer.\n Let me answer a second way to what is a serious concern. And the second way the situation could be dealt with is by the Department of Labor. They could look at their regulations and say, the industry has changed and therefore, in a way which could certainly be consistent with Congress's intent because it would not be withdrawing coverage from a previously covered employee who was employed by an enterprise, we could say that the exemption applies to companions and baby sitters employed by private individuals, including the homeowner, the son or daughter, etcetera.\n You're saying it's permissible to change the rules because the industry has changed. Is it not possible that the industry changed at about the time the statute was enacted? That the prevalence of third-party employers is something that really developed later?\n As an empirical matter, that is clearly the case, Justice Stevens. However, we know several things about Congress in 1974. We know that the enterprise coverage was relatively new. They adopted it in 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these very amendments in 1974. So Congress was aware of the prior coverage. We know that the Department of Labor, in the very reports which have been cited by the petitioner, stated both in January of 1973 and in January of 1974 in their reports to Congress on the Act, stated that there was prior coverage of domestics employed by third parties. We know there was enforcement activity by the Department of Labor against such third-party employers. So while the industry has certainly changed, there were enterprises who employed domestics, including companions, in 1974, and Congress was aware of it and stated over and over again in the preamble, in the committee reports, which indeed, the House committee report said, \"Our intention is to expand the act to the extent of Federal power.\"\n How   putting aside   putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible interpretation of the statute?\n Your Honor, we think it is the most plausible interpretation for the following reasons: Number one, contrary to what has been suggested, the language in the exemption is not identical to the language in the extension provision extending the minimum wage and overtime requirements. There is an important difference, and that difference is the word employment. Now that's important for several reasons. Number one, of course, coverage provisions are to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly. So there's an additional word that can and would suggest it should be read as a term of limitation. Number two, that difference must be given significance, if possible. The word should not be read to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it doesn't exist in the coverage provisions. And number three, we should avoid redundancy. There is a reading of that unique language, \"domestic service employment\", which makes sense and in fact, is exactly the reading given by the Department. Congress did not intend to  \n What employment would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment?\n The word domestic service employment is not necessary to describe what you described, Mr. Chief Justice. If that is what the Congress intended to describe, it could have said simply an employee employed to provide companionship services.\n Well, it could have said a lot of things. But I find it   you're hanging your case upon the proposition that there is a difference between domestic service employment and employed in domestic service employment. Wow. You know, I just don't see how there's any difference in those two at all.\n Your Honor  \n You're saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be. If there were a difference, I'm not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.\n What I'm suggesting is not that our case relies or hangs on that word. What I'm suggesting is if that word, that phrase, \"domestic service employment\", is given the definition which the Department of Labor itself gave it, it avoids reading two phrases which are different to mean the same thing. It avoids redundancy. And moreover, it is wholly consistent with every other piece of evidence we have about Congress's intent. Even the Department of Labor suggested it surely could not have been Congress's intent to retract coverage. The definition is consistent with that.\n Can I ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations, 552.3 and 552.   what is it, 109? I think they are contradictory. Now, the Agency has come up with a solution. We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but   you know   close enough for government work. What is your solution for solving the inconsistency? Are both of the regulations bad?\n My solution, Your Honor, has two parts but leads to the same conclusion. Our solution is that in applying the Act, which is the question here, does the Act apply to Ms. Coke's employment, this Court should apply the definitional regulations for two reasons, the definitional regulation for two reasons. One, it is the regulation, which no one disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the Department's law making function. The Department expressly defined and delimited its term \"domestic service employment\" in 552.3 and expressly said it was not doing so in the third-party regulation. So it's entitled to greater deference for that reason. But moreover  \n What's your other reason?\n It is the only definition which makes sense, which doesn't lead to a whole series of problems.\n Because of employed and domestic employment versus  \n For  \n   domestic service?\n For the following five reasons, Your Honor. One, it avoids reading a term in the statute, not only a term in the regulation but a term in the statute, completely out of the statute. And that is the term \"employment\". Secondly, as the Department found, it is consistent with what was Congress's clear intent, to expand and not to contract coverage. Thirdly, if one looks at the debates, and there was extensive and vigorous debate about these amendments, the exclusive focus in Congress was the household. The opponents were exclusively concerned with the extension of coverage to the households. So applying the exemption to protect only household employees is wholly consistent with what was Congress's exclusive  \n Well, you're getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they're about the statute. I'm assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference. And you have two regulations that are conflicting. Now, how do you decide which one prevails? Counsel for the other side says the specific governs the general, certainly an ancient prescription. Counsel also says that this is an agency regulation. The agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations. And even if the agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong, why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?\n Your Honor, of course setting aside, as you do, our argument that Congress has specific intent on this question, looking only at the regulation  \n That's statutory. I just want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the statutory  \n Let me answer in several ways. First, this Court has clearly held that an agency does not have unbounded discretion to construe its own regulations. When the terms of the regulations are unambiguous, they cannot be construed away. Now here  \n They aren't unambiguous. They contradict each other. The agency has to do something about it, and here the agency made a choice. Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, they were the mistake. One or the other had to be the mistake. We decided it was this one. Why shouldn't we take their word on it?\n Again, for two reasons, Your Honor. There's a difference between conflict and ambiguity. The words are unambiguous, and it's not simply the   there's two sets of words which they attempt to read out of the regulation, one of the unambiguous words that require employment by the person who's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory language which says the regulation only applies to the exemption. So in the guise of deference, the Solicitor General and the petitioners actually suggest to this Court that it should take apart the regulation and ignore two of its three operative provisions.\n But if they're flatly contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that .109(a) has lesser status? That's what it boils down to, isn't it?\n That is certainly my primary argument, that this statute is relatively unique in that it vested two very different sorts of authority in the Department of Labor, one a clear law making authority to actually define and delimit, to specify what the terms in the law mean  \n I'm talking about what you think the Department of Labor was doing when it promulgated 109(a). It was thinking in effect the following: We have the power to issue a regulation here that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to go through the procedure that would be necessary to issue such a regulation. But we're not invoking that power here because we want this interpretation which we think is the correct interpretation of the statute not to be followed   not to get as much deference from the courts as it would if we were invoking our power. Does that make any sense? That an agency would proceed in that way?\n Your Honor, it not only makes sense, it's been the Department's pattern since the Act was adopted. That is, the Department since the Act was adopted has split its regulations into those under the exemptions   for example the primary exemption for professional, executive and administrative employees   has split its regulations under those exemptions into those which define and delimit, into those which do not define and delimit, or other general statements that apply to their interpretation.\n Yeah, but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking. You know, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate about interpretive regulations. In fact, probably most of the significant regulations of the most important agencies are interpretive regulations.\n The important difference here, Justice Scalia, is the statute. The statute, like the tax statute which was interpreted by this Court in Vogel and Rowan, creates two types of authority. And not only under the Fair Labor Standards Act, but  \n I understand that you say it creates two types, but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other. What do you rely on for that?\n Your Honor  \n Where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?\n Well, let me qualify the question, if I might. The Petitioner would suggest that we're relying on simply a label, this is in the interpretive section and the other is in the general regulation section. Far from it. We are relying on a very clear statement both in the regulations, 552.2(c), as well as in both the proposed regulations and the final regulations, which clearly state that only those in Part A define and delimit. Why is that an important distinction? It's an important distinction because Congress clearly meant these two grants to be different. Otherwise, why would it have granted an express power to define and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of the general rulemaking authority?\n They're different but not necessarily of different   entitled to different respect from the courts. A defined   what is it, define and delimit? These are regulations that don't even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute, but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas, to say the   this rule won't apply to companies over this   that can't possibly be an interpretation of the statute. So Congress says we're going to give the agency that authority. In addition, of course, we're going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has, which is to interpret   interpret the language of the statute.\n Well, Your Honor, I think we can safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these two types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the law. And this Court, if you compare its decision in Addison to its decision in Skidmore, clearly itself distinguished between the exercise of those two different interpretive or rulemaking authority. Clearly in Addison, construing a very similar term in a different exemption, giving the Department of Labor the power to define a particular term in the exemption, said that is law making authority. And we will follow what the Department of Labor says unless it's clearly inconsistent with the statutory   with Congress's intent. In Skidmore, where that type of expressed delegated law making authority to define and delimit was not at issue, the Court said we will record only that degree of deference to which the regulation  \n Skidmore was before a rather significant case called Chevron.\n Absolutely, Your Honor. But it was also before the 1974 amendment. So if the question is, what was Congress intending in creating two types of rulemaking authority, the power to define and delimit, and the general rulemaking authority, I think we need to consider Congress's intent at that time.\n You mean we're going to divide all administrative law now into those   those regulations   those provisions that were adopted by Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently. Do you have any case of ours that suggests something like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of proceeding?\n Let me answer in two ways, Your Honor. One, it would not be any case. Here we have a particular statutory scheme that is contrary to  \n Ought not to get as much deference from the courts.\n Here we have a case essentially described by Justice Kennedy in & Haga, where we have a different statutory scheme combined with a explicit statement by the Agency as to which part of that scheme the Agency is operating under. But the case I would cite, or the cases would be Rolo and Rove which have not  \n Since we're into that, we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that possibly they had   they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute, because that's what it says in 552.2. It says \"this part\"   it doesn't say subpart, it says part   and part is 552. And both regs we are talking about are in the part. And B says interpretations, but they don't mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in them, and divide by 32. Nobody thinks that Congress meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide by 33. So as I read that, I thought the whole thing is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority; Part A has more general things. Part B has more specific things. Where am I wrong?\n Well, I think the question, Your Honor, is which of the regulations were promulgated pursuant to the specific authority  \n All of them. All of them is what it says unless I missed something.\n Well, I think what you missed is that a simple citation to the exemption does not translate into an exercise of the power to define and delimit. Because the Department was very, very specific as to when it was exercising that power. In 552.2(c) it says the definitions required by the legislation are provided in the following sections and it enumerates them and does not include the third-party regulation. Now Petitioners would suggest well, that's just a definition. They also have the power to delimit. However, both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the notice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising our power to define and delimit in subpart A.\n Okay. I got the point.\n But part B is different.\n Right. Right.\n So why are you sure there's a conflict in the first place? You know, 552.3 says that the term domestic service employment refers to services performed in the home of the employer. It doesn't say it only refers to that. And then you go down and 109 says it also includes employees who are employed by a third party. I mean, can't they be reconciled in that way.\n I don't think so, Your Honor. And its certainly not the way that the  \n It's not the way the Agency has done it. But you don't think we should defer to them, anyway. So   (Laughter.)\n That's correct. But the regulation   552.3 defines the statutory term which only exists in the exemption, domestic service employment.\n Yeah, but it says it refers to something. It doesn't say as many of these regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined as. And particularly when you're confronted with what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to should be read to mean includes rather than is defined as.\n Well, I think we have to read the definitional regulations together. That is, all of the terms in the exemption, companionship services, babysitting services, casual basis, domestic service employment, are all defined in the set of regulations, point 3, point 4, point 5, point 6. And it is clear from the prefatory language of each one that what the Department of Labor intended to do was define the terms in the statute. And so when it said that that term refers to  \n Well it is interesting when you look at   I mean, they're   it's a good point. It's interesting when you look at the other definitions, the babysitting, it says this provision shall mean. Here it just says it refers to. Let's see, the other ones   casual basis, shall mean. Companionship services, shall mean. This one doesn't say shall mean. It says it refers to this. I'm just wondering if that's something that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as the other definitions.\n I do not believe so, Your Honor. It is an exercise of the power to define the term and I don't think we can take that language \"refers to\" to be non-exclusive. When the Department said referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it was. If we have any doubt about what the Department intended, it actually of course reiterated that definition under the interpretive classification. And it again said that the term refers to, is defined as, employment by the household. If we had any doubt  \n Mr. Becker  \n There it says   there it says includes. And if you're talking about 552.101, there it says the term includes persons frequently referred to as private household workers.\n I'm referring to an earlier provision of the same regulation, not the reference to private household workers, but where it states that the definition includes those individuals who are employed by the household, that is in 552.101(a). But if we had any further doubt, the   that regulation refers to, as its source of the language, the regulation adopted under the Social Security Act, now 20 CFR 404.1057. It was originally numbered differently, but at the time, in 1974, that regulation which was explicitly the source of the language the Department of Labor used, said not once, not twice, but three times, that the individual had to be employed by the household.\n Mr.   Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway. So why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?\n Your Honor, setting aside, of course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3 which we've already explained, we would not say that that there is any credible evidence in the legislative history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was a factor. And let me explain why. The Department for the first time when it promulgated its advisory memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third party regulation. It said nothing of the sort in 1975. As support for the assertion it cited four isolated comments in the legislative history. None of them except the last   and there is only one of t-h-e-m related in any way to the exemption. The one that related to the exemption in fact directly supports our position, because it describes those people who are not within the exemption as the professional domestics. So we don't think that there's any basis for suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and, in fact, it is really implausible. Because at the same time, for example, Congress extended the provisions of the Act which covered nursing homes. At the same time, as has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual babysitters. Now We would submit that if Congress was concerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and companionship exemption, the primary intended beneficiaries of that would have been working families where both people worked and therefore who require a full-time baby sitter  \n Thank you, Counsel.\n   and a full-time baby is not covered. Thank you very much.\n Mr. Farr, you have three minutes remaining.\n Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. Respondent in response to Justice Scalia's question about how Respondent would reconcile the regulation 552.3 and 109(a) actually did not I believe attempt any reconciliation. If I understand respondent's position correctly, it's simply 109(a) has to be invalidated dated and 552.3 stands in its entirety. I think that's incorrect for several reasons. First of all, the basis for it is essentially this apparent distinction between the define and delimit authority and the more general authority to enact necessary rules and regulation. But, in fact, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants of authority were invoked by the Department when it enacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to either subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that Justice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to attribute to the Department to say that it would exercise two different legislative powers in different parts of the   of the regulations. There's no reason it would do that. The subpart B regulations clearly are regulations that delimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15). There's no question about that. So why in fact if it was doing what Congress authorized it to do under 213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of authority in that provision, rely on some other general grant of authority? It makes no logical sense to attribute that to the Department. And it seems to me, in   excuse me   in fact, that that argument points up one of the difficulties here. It seems to me that the arguments here are a way of simply trying to push the Department aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job of exposition on this exemption. Not only contrary to the basic principle of Chevron, which is where that where is ambiguity in the statute, or room for interpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity to do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary to the statute. It is clear as I said at the beginning of my argument, the Department was the agency chosen by Congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the exception. Now I'd like to say just one other thing in response to Justice Stevens' question about the particular nature of the litigation. This is a suit for damages. It is a suit claiming will damages. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the system described in Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the guidelines. That, of course, was a passage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham versus California. Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it meant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are merely advisory provisions. The Government's assertion that the guidelines deserve a presumption of reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the Booker decision. The ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the Booker decision before the Department of Justice issued a memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary cases. The district court below in this case did not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a 33-month within guideline sentence. The district court did not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact that he had been a combat soldier in two wars.\n How can you say that, given that at the sentencing hearing, that military record was brought out, his physical ailments were brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that was brought out? And indeed, the judge was assisting the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it was presented.\n In the district court, Mr. Rita did put forward evidence of his military records, health concerns, he   the district court received that information. The district court did not consider that information because there's nothing in the record where the district judge weighed any of that information to determine what   what effect to give any of it.\n Well, you know, you don't get a summary judgment case all the time. I used to get them, and the district court would hear all the arguments and write down the word denied. Does that mean he didn't consider the arguments? That's a very common thing. Here we have a district judge, he hears all the arguments. The attorneys brought it out. It's in the file. He reads the presentence report. It's all there, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go apply the guidelines. So how can you say he didn't consider them?\n Justice Breyer, the district judge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the stuff, and I  \n No, he doesn't in a summary judgment case either. I mean, I've had quite a few of them, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied. That was the opinion.\n Well, in the instance of a summary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that requires the district court to state in open court in front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of sentence.\n Now, he says the reasons are these. I think that the guidelines sentence is a reasonable sentence. Would that be sufficient?\n It would not, Your Honor.\n Why not? What in the statute or the law or the Constitution says that a district judge, although it might be good form in a difficult case to write more, but I've often written opinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we feel are not sufficient to change the result. That means I don't think they're that great an argument, and I don't answer every single one.\n With regard to the first question Your Honor posed, it's not sufficient for the district court to simply state conclusions, which is what happened in this case, that  \n Where in the law does it say that?\n Well, in 3553(c), it requires that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence.\n Where   I'm looking at that. It says shall consider. Am I missing something?\n The preamble states  \n Can you give me your page cite?\n I'm sorry, Your Honor, on page 3-A of Petitioner's brief in the appendix. It states, \"the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\" And that's what we contend requires the district court to explain the facts that the court is relying on to impose the particular sentence in the case.\n So it isn't sufficient, in your view, that the judge just says, the reason I imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence, and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?\n That's correct, Your Honor. Because the guidelines don't take into account all the myriad facts, and in this case, did not take into account the military record, the employment record, Mr. Rita's health concerns. The guidelines specifically did not take those into account.\n I think these other factors that have been brought out, while they're serious factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a different sentence. Suppose he adds those words?\n Your Honor, I think the  \n What I'm worried about basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special category that requires a judge to give special reasons in a guideline case. I think it's the same as any other matter. Judges do normally give reasons. And I'd worry a bit about creating a special situation where district judges have to do something unusual.\n I don't think that this is unusual, Your Honor. I think the court has to explain the rationale for imposing the sentence, and not only does it have to do so in court, in front of the defendant, so the defendant understands the sentence that he is receiving  \n Well, I get where you're going. Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy you? And of course, like any other matter, judges do normally give reasons. They do normally reject arguments with reasons, and it's the same here. Would that satisfy you?\n I think it would have to be specific to the issues raised by the parties. And in this case, at a minimum, the judge would have to address the three issues that Mr. Rita put forward and discuss those: His military record, his employment, his health concerns. It would have to address any issues that the Government would raise, and any issues that the district judge was considering that maybe neither party had raised to the court as well.\n How do you reconcile the language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall state the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from the guidelines? Now, this seems to set up some dichotomy between giving reasons and giving the specific reason. Where does that line fall in your estimation?\n Well, I think foremost, Your Honor, is that that provision came about prior to the Booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory. And what that addresses and what it was meant to address was if the court were to depart, then it was   it needed to explain that departure in a greater reason to enable the sentencing commission to take that information into account in revising the guidelines. That is still a purpose with the sentencing commission, to revise the guidelines, and they can still use that information. But it   at the very least, we need information from the sentencing judge about each of the matters that he or she  \n You haven't answered my question. I mean, you explain why it's put in there, but I want to know what is the difference between giving the reasons and giving the specific reason.\n The specific reason I think, Your Honor, is so that the sentencing commission can take that information into account in later revisions of the guidelines. That was the purpose at the point that statute was passed.\n But are you saying now that that distinction should be ignored?\n I don't know, Your Honor, if it's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the district court needs to give as many reasons, or as clear a reason for the imposition of the particular sentence. That will help  \n But it sounds to me as though you want all the reasons to be specific. I mean, I understand your argument. But if we accept that argument, then the distinction between reason and specific reason basically is going to be a matter of history, and perhaps it should be.\n It, it may, Your Honor. And, and because that provision predated this Court's Booker decision, it still holds relevance but not nearly the relevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory.\n So your position would be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed would have to   that the trial judge would also have to go through   now this defendant maintained his innocence. He didn't express any remorse. He accused a Government agent of perjury. All that, he would have to take into account, just as specifically?\n Your Honor, I think that the Court certainly could consider all of that; and   and if pressed by the Government would need to consider that. But certainly at a minimum, the Court needs to  \n Isn't that what the Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?\n It did, Your Honor, and again the district court never came out with any specifics regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion that it felt that the guideline range was not inappropriate.\n Suppose the district court says I give these following   I've considered these following specific factors. But in my view, the consistency and nationwide uniformity that the guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and for that reason, I'm following the guidelines?\n I don't  \n Is that an inappropriate judgment for the district court to make?\n I think it's inappropriate, Your Honor, because while there should be uniformity in an attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not the end all and be all. 3553(a) addresses individualized sentencing of the defendant before the court.\n It's not the end all. Suppose the district judge said I think this is of great importance. You don't think that the Booker opinion   or do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity and consistency as an important factor?\n I don't believe the Booker decision rejected that, Your Honor. What I believe the Booker opinion said was that for there to be advisory guidelines, for there to be constitutional sentencing practices, then uniformity is going to have to give way to some extent. At least at the very beginning. Once the district courts apply the 3553(a) factors, and go through the statute, and consider the guidelines, the district courts will then explain their rationale; and then that rationale will be   in our opinion, will show where the shortcomings of the guidelines are.\n Mr. Cochran, are you arguing the sentencing in this case violated the Sixth Amendment?\n Not as it was applied. It came close in the sense that the district court was laboring, in our opinion, under the belief that the guidelines held some control.\n If it didn't violate the Sixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the Sentencing Reform Act?\n Well, it came   it may have violated the Sixth Amendment. I don't know that I would concede that. But to avoid any constitutional issue, if we analyzed this under the statute, clearly the district court didn't comply with the statute.\n You can't say whether it did or did not violate the Sixth Amendment?\n The district court held the guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.\n Well, was your client's sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been submitted to the jury?\n Well, under   under a pure advisory system   and I think Your Honor is addressing the cross-reference in this matter   in a purely advisory system, the guidelines were calculated correctly in Mr. Rita's case, because under a purely advisory system, the district court could look at that cross-reference, understand that it came about from uncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it. But by not doing so in this case, and that cross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range, then this case may very well be unconstitutional because of the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines.\n Mr. Cochran, you do contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been mandatory, there would have been a violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n No question, Your Honor.\n Because of the, the accessory after the fact point.\n That's right, Your Honor, absolutely.\n Then the question ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in the guidelines as a reasonable   if you're an appellate court judge. And you think it does violate the Sixth Amendment?\n Our position is that the presumption does violate the Sixth  \n Then I guess the argument of the other side, which I would like you to address, is that, in which there   we didn't think it violated the of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied 3553   uh, 3553(a). And of course, 3553(a) includes all of these things that go into the guidelines; it make a big point of that in 3553(a). So why   why couldn't you say, you know, all these factors are taken into account by the commission? They start with an effort to a apply them in typical cases. This is their judgment in typical cases. So it is entitled to some kind of weight; and   at least in a typical case.\n Your Honor, the guidelines should be consulted. No question  \n No, no, not consulting them. What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a judge reading this give them without violating the Sixth Amendment? All I'm trying to do here is not whether the guidelines are good, bad, or indifferent. Congress wanted to apply them. We excised the mandatory to comply with the Sixth Amendment. Now, what else do we have to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment? Because I would think unless we have to do something else, we shouldn't do it, because Congress wanted it.\n I would contend, Your Honor, that the Court needs to very clearly explain that the guidelines are, are a reference. They are  \n The guidelines are what?\n Are a reference.\n Can you say it is an initial benchmark?\n I don't   when we start establishing benchmarks and presumptions, I think that's where we, we  \n So benchmarks are bad. Presumption is bad. Great weight, that's bad?\n That's bad, too. And I think it's just another thing to consider.\n Does it matter what judge did in other cases? I mean, if we look on the day before he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I think this case is different, so I'm going to depart, and the day after he says I know what the guidelines are, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence? I mean, how do we know he's   when he says I looked at the guidelines and I think they're appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed to what he said? Which is, well, I cannot find that they're inappropriate?\n And what that tells me, Mr. Chief Justice, is that, that the district court felt that the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the judge was bound   in other words, shifted the burden to the defendant to say, well, I   unless you can show that these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a benchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that that is what the Sixth Amendment prohibits. If the guidelines are advisory, if they are but one of many factors to be considered, together with all of the other factors in 3553(a), the court can use that information, can use that reference. But once it starts putting any greater weight on the guidelines   and the statute doesn't admit to that.\n How about the point that Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been taken into account by the sentencing commission because Congress told them to consider those same factors?\n Well, Your Honor, the sentencing commission by its own admission has not taken into account all of the factors. In the very first guideline manual, 1987, the sentencing commission itself said it could not take into account all of the facts that play into human conduct.\n There are two separate things there. The general aims of sentencing, the four basic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission certainly took into account. A separate thing was the rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has not been fully considered by the guidelines. And there the original version, I believe, said that we've considered nothing thoroughly. Except for certain specific matters that had been mentioned like age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily. Now, that is what you're thinking of? I mean, if that's what you're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what your present point is.\n I'm not, Your Honor. First of all, I don't know and would contend that the initial sentencing commission did not take into account all of the four purposes of sentencing. They centered on crime control  \n That's because when they looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into account, it was there was a consensus among experts that there isn't much you can do about it. That's different from not taking into account.\n The other point I think with regard to that, Your Honor, is in looking at 3553(a) that statute gives the district court the dual commands of first considering all of those factors and then imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary. The statute does not give to the sentencing commission that obligation.\n Mr. Cochran, I have this concern: If we accept your submission that the district court should just consider the guidelines together with everything else, give them a presumption of validity, anything else, just something to consider, that would presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with the district court's findings of fact. But the district court's sentence is going to go on appeal. And the appellate court in reviewing it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the appellate   the appellate court says oh, no, this person had   we find as a matter of fact, given the record, military service, you know, which we think should have been taken into account. And, therefore, we set it aside. Now, the next case that comes up, which doesn't have the element of military service, in all other respects the same as your client's case, it comes up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here and therefore we affirm the sentence. Isn't   in other words isn't the finding of a fact necessary for the process of judicial review, even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the district court's determination? He would not get that sentence but for this fact.\n That's correct, Your Honor. And  \n So you haven't shown us a way out of the problem.\n In a purely advisory system, the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and maximum. And as this Court has said in Cunningham, if the Court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and maximum, then the factual finding as to where within that is up to the district court. It's only when we establish thresholds as the guidelines do we run into the constitutional problem.\n No, even if you don't   don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline, you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review, guidelines or not. If the   if the appellate court says, oh, given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is made a necessary condition for giving the higher sentence. So you haven't   you haven't solved the problem of the, of the apparent conflict between   between Booker and the advisory guidelines.\n Well, I think so long as the district court can evaluate and consider and potentially reject what the guidelines say, just as the Court can consider the effect of   of the person's military record, Mr. Rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which is separate and apart from someone who may have been an Army recruiter  \n You're not focusing on my point. I concede that the district court is free as a bird   free as a bird   but you have appellate review. And the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness is going to make a particular fact determinative of whether this sentence can stand or not. Isn't that right?\n It is.\n And that's going to be a problem.\n I think what the court would have   the appellate court would have to do is evaluate all of that through the prism of 3553(a). Is the sentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction that the court below could have imposed. And if not, for whatever reasons, vacate it and return it back to the district court.\n Counsel, what if there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other judges have done; he presses a button on the computer, give me what the sentences were looking at these facts, and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the sentence was. And he says this seems to me no different than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose. Is there any problem with that?\n There is. And again, because 3553(a) is an individual weighing of the defendant  \n Yes, well, he looks at all the individual factors and he says they seem not terribly different from these 100 other cases and the range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7 years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.\n If the district court considers all those facts and considers what may have been done and it is sufficient, if not greater than necessary given those facts, then the court can do that.\n How is that different than the   how is that different than looking at the guidelines, which did that in a much more comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything different in this case from the normal guidelines case and so I'm going to impose that sentence?\n Well, the guidelines didn't take everything into account, and the sentencing courts were coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of being required to follow this book that necessarily didn't incorporate all of the human factors in sentencing. And they have held to that.\n Well, it did incorporate them in that district judges were free to depart from the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one of these human factors not considered by the guidelines which existed in the particular case.\n In theory, yes, Justice Scalia. But in practice, no, because what happened in the very cases as United States versus Foy out of the Ninth Circuit, the defendant in that case argued to the district court that he should have a departure based upon lack of mutual guidance, and it was a reasoned decision. It went to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit found it to be a reasoned decision; and within the next amendment process of the Sentencing Commission, it was eliminated as a departure basis with no discussion at all. So yes, there may have been departures, but they were systematically removed, and in fact chapters 5(h) and 5(a) show that very clearly.\n Well, if they were systematically removed then all of these other human factors that you're complaining about were considered by the guideline commission and were simply rejected.\n They weren't considered, Your Honor, and in the history of those amendments that's borne out. And if the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve some time.\n Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals appropriately applied a presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that this Court announced in United States versus Booker. The guidelines represent the integration of the multiple purposes of sentencing reflected in section 3553(a) that the district court is obligated to consider. The commission also represents an expert body that has considered the various parameters of sentencing and the fact patterns that arise in the Federal system and has made an effort over time to arrive at an appropriate  \n Isn't it true, just to get one thought out on the table, that there are factors that the guidelines don't   did not consider, such as military service?\n Justice Stevens, the commission considered that factor and then determined that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence outside the guidelines.\n But isn't it true that under the guideline no weight is given to military service?\n The guidelines specifically do not give weight to it. They permit a judge  \n What should a judge do if he thought some weight should be given to military service?\n Under Booker the judge should do that. That is the difference between an advisory guidelines system and a mandatory guidelines system. The judge can give weight to factors That the commission decided should not have weight in the sentencing process. That is the essence of what it means for the guidelines  \n And presumably cannot give weight to factors that the commission decided should have weight.\n He can do that, too, Justice Scalia.\n Are we back to the original version, which I'll read what it says. It says: \"With a few specific exceptions   race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, socioeconomic State   with those exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\" That's what it said. A part of the guidelines in the heartland. If it's not the heartland, depart. Now, what I wonder is are we not back under your theory of it just to where we were when it started out, before the commission started ruling all these things out and began to make all its   the judge could do that.\n I think we're back, Justice Breyer, to a further point even than the first set of guidelines, because even under the first set of guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that wasn't taken into account.\n We said we took nothing into account and therefore any circumstance that makes the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an exception.\n I understand that, Justice Breyer.\n You're saying more than that is necessary.\n I think that the reconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker and its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's different from what's described in the guidelines.\n He could do this: He could set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take account of sentencing. But suppose he doesn't do that. Then, if you take your view that there's a presumption in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the guideline?\n Justice Breyer, I think we have to distinguish between what the job of the district court is and what the job of the appellate court is; and in this case, the Government is arguing for a presumption of reasonableness on appeal. Once the district judge has determined that the guidelines sentence aligns with his own application of the section 3553(a) factors, our submission here is that a court of appeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable sentence. The defendant of course has the opportunity, or the Government if the Government has appealed, to show that that presumption is overcome.\n But unless there is a way to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no clear way to distinguish the presumption from the mandate. The mandate is gone. You say yes, they consider other things. But unless we can calibrate the presumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate was force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something like that, there's no way to tell the two apart in practice.\n Justice Souter, I'm not sure that that would be true even if what we were talking about was a direction to the district judge to presume that he would impose a guidelines sentence. But that's not what we're talking about. The district judge does not operate and does not have to operate under the position that we're arguing for with a presumption that the judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless persuaded otherwise. The judge's obligation is to  \n He doesn't have to do it unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.\n I would think that what the judge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his statutory obligations.\n Well, perhaps I misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this concern, and I thought it was his concern as well. At the appellate level, is the presumption something that can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing or is it just an initial benchmark? We're playing with standards and words here.\n Well, we are.\n And when we talk about presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a little strange in any event. You usually talk about presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.\n That's true, Justice Kennedy. But I think what it reflects at the appellate level is that the court of appeals enters the case with an attitude that, our job is to decide whether what the district judge did was reasonable. We can operate  \n So we write that this is an additive thing?\n Yes, I think that it's not so different from the court of appeals saying we can enter this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges that shows us a good reason otherwise.\n Well, is your view   on your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence only if it is shown to be unreasonable?\n The latter, Justice Souter. And I think that in that regard there is a range of reasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a given set of facts.\n Well, if you   if you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with the same identical background and everything else, one judge says, I think military service should be taken into account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines by 3 years. The judge next door says, I don't think it should be taken into account so I'm going to impose the guideline sentence. Both cases are appealed. They're consolidated for argument. What is the court of appeals supposed to do? Uphold both of them?\n The court of appeals can uphold both of them if it concludes that the actual sentence that's imposed is reasonable. And in the second case that the Court is going to hear today the Government argues for a proportionality principle that should govern the review of sentencing.\n What is reasonable is   is not merely a sort of number within a spectrum. It seems to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of the reasons that are given. And in the Chief Justice's view, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for two different sentences. Does the, does the appellate court in his example say, well, I think reasonable people could go either way on that, so however it comes out it's fine on appellate review? Isn't that what the court would have to do in order to affirm both sentences, other things being equal?\n You're right, Justice Souter, and I can't say that that would be the first choice of the Congress that enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.\n Isn't it clear that it would have been the last choice of the Congress?\n It is, and it's not the first choice of the Government, either. But it strikes me that it is something of an inevitability once this Court has declared that mandatory guidelines are impermissible under the Constitution if judicial factfinding  \n What does the Sixth Amendment have to do with the selection of the sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed? How can there be a Sixth Amendment violation if either the guidelines or our case law says military service is or is not a relevant factor? I don't see how that has anything to do with anything that you can get out of the Sixth Amendment.\n It probably does not, Justice Alito. But what happened in the first part of Booker is that the Court declared that the guidelines are advisory and advice. It's advice that can be accepted or rejected.\n I know, but Booker says what we're trying to do is to come close to what Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment. Now, what I think we're talking about now   I think   i mean, you sort of shed some   you clarified something very well for me, which is that in this case we're talking about the situation where the district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the attitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you have to   you better show me a good reason to think to the contrary. Fine. But the interesting problem is the problem of the next case which you're now talking about, is, well, what happens if the district judge and when should be the district judge and how free should the district judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence even if it's not an unusual case.\n Let me try to address that and try to address Justice Alito's point about the question of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth Amendment problem arises. As I understand this Court's sequence of opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the Court has announced and must be found by a jury.\n Or some fact, not necessarily a particular fact.\n Any fact at all, as a matter of fact is what the Court has said, although I understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense and the offender, not facts about the world such as the prevalence of crime. Now, what that leads me to conclude is that in order to escape the bright line rule that's been announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be able to look at the set of facts that the jury found, determine what level of punishment would be advised by, say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose that level of punishment if the judge feels that a different level of punishment is appropriate. If that is a correct understanding of what this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and not an arbitrary one. Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission said, that would be very good from the Government's perspective. But as I understand the complementary rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be treated as advice rather than mandate. So while the guidelines have determined that military service is not ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.\n May I ask you, this is the hypothetical: Supposing a judge thinks military service is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a little below the guidelines. But then he says, I recognize that in this circuit there is a strong interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has adopted a rule where they will presume a within guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in those cases. And I think with respect to the court of appeals, I think I would be wise to impose the guidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own judgment is that it should be slightly lower. What should the court of appeals do with such a sentence?\n I think the court of appeals should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of law, which is that the judge  \n Should reverse the judge then, within a   a within guidelines sentence?\n In the circumstance, Justice Stevens, I think that you put your finger on two different types of review. In the circumstance in which a district judge operates with what I'll call legal blinders on that prevent him from complying with  \n No. He operates with total candor. He's saying exactly what he feels like saying.\n I'm hoping that it's a misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said, because the court of appeals should not have told the judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.\n Well, they didn't say you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.\n Judges are still obligated to comply with 3553(a), which requires them to exercise discretion. Now if a judge decides I might as a personal matter if I were writing the guidelines write them differently, and I might give great weight to military service, but one of the things that I'm required to do under section 3553(a) is to consider the need to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and have similar records. And therefore, I am going to moderate my own personal preference and not impose a significant outside the range sentence, in order to ensure that I fully have taken into account the fact that we are in a Federal system with 674 Federal district judges, and we cannot have all our own personal guidelines systems. Now if a judge does that, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think that judge has actually complied with  \n What if the court of appeals does that? What if the court of appeals says we've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of them do not take military service into account, one does, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the interest in uniformity. And so even though that one judge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?\n Mr. Chief Justice, I think there's a difference between a sentence that varies from what other judges would do and a sentence that is unreasonable. If the sentence that is different from what other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and coherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of disparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like this one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says in my view military service means that this defendant gets probation. Or to take an example that's on the other side, suppose that the judge says this defendant actually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal history for his prior crime, but he has been convicted before of lying to the Government about his gun charges. I'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or near it and give him eight years. I think in those circumstances a court of appeals can and should say, hold on, this is a view that the district judge is entitled to take on the merits. He's entitled to give greater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating or mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to this extent, or we're going to be left with a system in which disuniformity is the main principle.\n It's not that complicated. All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33 percent of the defendants in the typical case have been in the Army. And therefore, we think that just ordinary armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed   services in the military is not a reason for a diminished sentence. That's all, period. Or they can say it the other way, the absence of a military service is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any way you want. And by the way, district judge, if you disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because we think it's unreasonable. Okay. What about that?\n That to me sounds identical to the system that pre-existed Booker's holding.\n It did. But is there anything in the Sixth Amendment that forbids that?\n This Court hasn't specifically addressed  \n Well, what do you think? Because I would think that if you're going to answer that question yes, you are saying that not even the court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness among different defendants in respect to sentencing.\n Well, Justice Breyer, I would like to be able to answer the question yes and say that courts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal rules as  \n It's not sub-legal rules. What it's called is precedent. What you do is you decide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you decide it the same way. And if a district judge doesn't follow that, you reverse it.\n Justice Breyer, if do you that, what you have is each court of appeals functioning as a sentencing commission.\n Exactly. You've simply substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the district court following circuit law for the guidelines. And  \n Exactly.\n If the guidelines are unconstitutional because they make facts automatically determinative, I assume that would be unconstitutional because it makes facts automatically determinative.\n I assume too under the rationale  \n Well then, in other words, the Constitution of the United States prevents the courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences who are   that individuals who are in similar positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in similar ways. That to me is possible, but of course I've been in dissent in these cases. But it seems to me  \n So long as the jury determines the facts that make them similar.\n We're back  \n The problem here is what makes them similar.\n I understand this dialogue. And what we have   (Laughter.) I too have been with the dissenters in these cases, and what I'm trying to argue for here is a set of principles that appellate courts can apply and that district courts can look to when sentencing, that will come as close as is reasonably possible to achieving Congress's aims in the Sentencing Reform Act without crossing over the bright line rule that this Court has announced  \n I don't know how terribly different it is than the normal review for abuse of discretion. I mean, you don't even need two judges in my earlier question. Let's say you have the same judge, and for three weeks every criminal defendant who comes before him he says, I think if you have military service, you should get a reduction. And then all of a sudden he says, I see you have military service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction. I mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard to be a little bit consistent? And if that's the only type of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure some degree of consistency in how similar individuals are treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises any concern.\n Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not arguing for any proposition that I think would raise concern. I do think that a general tenet of abuse of discretion review is that the court of appeals can affirm a result that it would not necessarily have reached itself.\n Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised? I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates a district court sentence, that there is no presumption that binds the district judge. But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran made in his presentation was the district judge has to give reasons. He   this was just a summary paragraph at the end of the sentence hearing. He has to respond to what defendant presented. He has to respond to what the Government presented. There is an obligation stemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that the court of appeals has used. Reasons weren't given for it.\n Justice Ginsburg, I don't think there was anything problematic with what this district judge did. As Your Honor noted, this was a sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward departure. The judge at least four times in this transcript brought up Section 3553, recognizing that the judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the purposes of sentencing and the factors that were presented to him. Now he did that and he made comments along the way that indicate why he did not find physical condition, military service, or asserted vulnerability in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this defendant a lower sentence. And in his ultimate explanation, though it is brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors explicitly. He pointed to the seriousness of the offense and he pointed to the need for public protection. Now if you look at the legal obligations that the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of three different levels of explanation. First, in any case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence. Second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24 months, the judge is supposed to explain the particular reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end of the range. And finally, if the sentence is outside the range, the judge is to give the specific reason for a sentence outside the range. That statutory framework makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge imposes a guideline sentence and explains, I see no reason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met his burden of explanation without having to respond literally and in sequence to each argument that the defendant has made.\n May I ask this question? The district judge is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, which I take it means there's a presumption he got it right. Is that correct? There's a presumption the district judge sentence is correct?\n Well, Justice Stevens, our position is more complicated than that, because within a guidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the Government  \n Why shouldn't there be also the same presumption when it is outside the guidelines range?\n Because sentences that are outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a sentence within the range. And that is why that if the court of appeals is interested in fulfilling what Booker said the role of the court of appeals is, which is to iron out sentencing differences, there is more reason for the  \n Well, do you think the interest in uniformity, in same sentences across the board is stronger than the interest in getting the correct sentence for the particular defendant who's in court at the time?\n Well, there isn't any one correct sentence usually.\n No, there isn't. But if you say the district judge has broad discretion, which he does, and the review is under abuse of discretion, why should there not always be a presumption that the district judge got it right?\n Because there are more legal elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review than just those that you've named, Justice Stevens. Section 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for review, mandates that the district court consider the guidelines, consider the policy  \n Yes, but it's sort of like findings of fact. They must take into consideration all sorts of aspects of the case, and you have a strong presumption that the findings of fact are accurate. Why don't you have a strong presumption that the ultimate judgment on the sentence is also accurate?\n What happens when a sentence is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater risk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities; and in contrast to a sentence within the range which does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a sentence outside the range may well. It's different from what the sentencing commission with its expertise and its experience has recommended as the appropriate sentence, given those facts.\n Well, you're   I mean, this is a self fulfilling prophecy. You're saying if you don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going to have uniformity. Well, I   my goodness. Is that consistent with the notion that the guidelines are advisory?\n I wouldn't put it as strongly as that, Justice Scalia. What I would say is that the further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines range, the greater the possibility of unwarranted disparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals should look more critically at the reasons that the district court gave and ensure that the constellation of reasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to be a disproportionate sentence than  \n But that's just inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct, that the district judge can simply disagree with the basic   basic reasons of the commission, can simply disagree with the fact that the commission considers white collar crime, for example, something that should justify incarceration.\n But Justice Scalia, reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals will review the reasons that the district court gave for that disagreement.\n So doesn't your presumption argument come down to an argument for a sufficiently comprehensive statement of reasons, with a more extensive statement required the further the court gets from the guidelines? Isn't that what it boils down to?\n It does for an out of range sentence, Justice Souter. I think that for a sentence within the range, the judge's statement that I have considered the guidelines range and I think it's appropriate does explain why that judge has given the sentence that he's given. It's consistent with the statute and it's consistent with the Constitution. Now when  \n Is there   may I interrupt you? Because your time is getting short. Is there a difference between a presumption of reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and a rule that says the further you get from them, you can get as far as you want to, but the further you get from them, the more extensive your explanation has to be? Is there a distinction between those two, two rules?\n There is a distinction between them but I think they are complementary rules and in the next case the Government will argue for a presumption that is precisely what you have articulated, Justice Souter. A greater and more extensive and more persuasive explanation is needed the further that you go from the guidelines range.\n Or presumably the further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from the guidelines range? If you've got a submission here 18 compelling reasons, you shouldn't follow the guidelines, and you get one sentence from the district court saying   you know   I followed the guidelines, presumably that would be the same as a significant departure without further justification?\n It wouldn't be identical but I agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a compelling case for a sentence outside the range because the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance. The sentencing commission itself recognized that the guidelines were generalizations; they carved out a heartland in the language of the sentencing commission's first set of guidelines, and that there will be circumstances that would justify different sentences.\n Is the system that you're describing any different for mandatory guidelines that are subject to departure when the district judge finds a significant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines had?\n Yes, Justice Scalia. It is quite  \n Wherein is it different?\n It is different precisely on the area that, that you yourself articulated. The judge can disagree with the sentencing guidelines and determine that on the basis of the facts that the jury found, the judge would impose a different sentence, and that conclusion is then subject for reasonableness review and we submit based on a proportionality principle.\n Thank you, Dreeben. Mr. Cochran, you have three minutes remaining.\n That you, Mr. Chief Justice. I would like to return first to the across the board reasonableness review that this Court established in Booker. That in and of itself shows why there cannot be a presumption of reasonableness on appeal. Because you are holding the presumption to a different standard at that point. It is not a reasonableness across the board. You are putting the burden on one the parties, most likely the defendant, to come forward and explain why the presumption should be rebutted. That flies in the face with the across the board reasonableness this Court set forth in Booker. The guidelines are fraught with disparity. That why is they are advisory. That's why they can only be advisory. And the district courts must be allowed to look at them, to see them, to consider them, but ultimately to impose a sentence outside them for valid reasons. In Mr. Rita's case, the court didn't. The court felt the guidelines held some undue weight. It is indicated in the record in two places, first and foremost on page 49 of the joint appendix, where the court at the beginning of the sentencing hearing states: Other than the motion for downward departure that you submitted, do you have any other objections; and what I'm trying to do now is determine where your client fits within the sentencing guidelines. Clearly the judge was rooted in the guidelines and that's why he gave a sentence of 33 months at the low end.\n The, the judge also pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant protested his independence, and the jury had found him guilty of false statements.\n That's correct. That's  \n The judge was bound by those.\n That's correct, Your Honor, but interestingly the court found very dubious the additional information regarding the cross-reference. And on page 87 of the joint appendix, the court states it was not able to evaluate the seriousness of that other investigation; and yet that was the cross-reference that doubled his guidelines sentence. We would ask the Court to rule in this case that the presumption of reasonableness cannot be accorded to the guidelines.\n Mr. Cochran, you've started out by saying there were two places in the record that you thought showed the judge was bound by the guidelines. 49, what was the other one?\n Your Honor, the other one was page 87.\n Of the one   oh, that point? Okay.\n And that would be in the second paragraph, Mr. Chief Justice, where the court found it was unable to stray or found the guidelines were inappropriate; and I suggest that that is a, a giving of greater weight and too much so in this case. Your Honor, Mr. Rita asks the Court to find that a presumption cannot be accorded to the guidelines, that his sentence was unreasonable in this case, and that his case be returned for resentencing. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Cochran. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court's 15-month sentence combined with 3 years of supervised release conditioned on drug treatments and the acquisition of a GED was a reasonable sentence. In the uniform and constant tradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district judge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an individual. She considered the guidelines and after doing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in every case. She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted disparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that deterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances to resume his responsibilities to himself, to his family, and to his community. The court of appeals, in contrast to the district court's careful attention to the 3553(a) factors, focused solely on the guidelines. The court of appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule. That rule re-tethers sentencing to the guideline.\n What would be your test of reasonableness for appellate review?\n I think a sentence would be reasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and circumstances of that case would find that the sentence imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to satisfy 3553(a) standards.\n It seems to me that gives very little weight to the goal, which I think is a congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system which cause great disrespect to the justice system.\n I think that the statute speaks of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of uniformity. And there is necessarily a tension between the individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and concerns about nationwide uniformity. But I think that what distinguishes sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the Presentencing Reform Act system are several. One is now we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors the judge must consider. 3553 didn't exist before that time. Secondly, in every case, as a practical matter, the guidelines are going to exert a gravitational weight because they are there. They must be considered as part of the statute.\n Can I substitute \"substantial\" for \"gravitational\" without offending your position or affecting your position?\n I don't   my position would be that 3553(a)(4) is the correct place for consideration of the guidelines. It's just one of seven factors. As a practical matter, I think it's going to get  \n Kind of a weak law of gravity like the Moon. It's only at one-seventh. (Laughter.)\n As a legal matter weak. As a practical matter, I think unfortunately it's going to be very strong. And I think one of the real dangers of an advisory guideline  \n Well, I guess the question is how strong should we say or can we say, or can Congress say it is?\n I think that the strength should be no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I think the danger, particularly after 20 years of guideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of exercising their discretion, which now runs to the full limit of 3553(a).\n Then it seems to me that to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from the process.\n I think the appellate courts are   I think Booker considered a very deferential standard of review. The cases that the Booker Court cited to illustrate the standard of review of reasonableness were all highly deferential decisions regarding revocations following supervised release, affirming sentences that were many times what the chapter 7 policy guidelines would require. The court of appeals necessarily must be deferential or I think it pushes the system back into a mandatory  \n Well, suppose the court of appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in the Sentencing Reform Act. Would there be a problem there?\n I think there would, Justice Alito, because I don't think that the role of the appellate court is to substitute its judgment for the application and weight applied to the 3553(a) factors for the district court.\n That's a principle that you derive from what? From the Sixth Amendment? From the Sentencing Reform Act? From where?\n Well, I think it derives in part from the Sentencing Reform Act, which contemplated individualized sentencing.\n The Sentencing Reform Act required, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines. And you're saying that the Sentencing Reform Act now precludes appellate review of   it gives the trial judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad discretion?\n Certainly extremely broad discretion.\n How do you get that out of the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?\n Even under a mandatory guidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it recognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an important goal of individualized sentencing. And the Court in Koon recognized that district courts in their institutional position have a special competence to determine what's ordinary in a case, what's unusual in a case. The court of appeals lacks that special competence. It sees only a tiny fraction of the number of guideline cases. It doesn't have  \n So one of the guides for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a particular type of case?\n I think that what guides the court of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to the particular case and determine if the reasons on the record in that case, the district court's  \n It's impossible to do in the abstract. If you're just looking at a particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is reasonable or not. There has to be a background to it so that you know that in this type of case, people usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a sentence of 10 years. And it seems to me that what's ordinary is going to be a judge   a driving fact in determining what's reasonable.\n I think the court of appeals' job is to ensure that the district judge provides reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of that case that establish that the district court had complied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case, selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater than necessary. I don't believe that it is the court of appeals' job, as was remarked earlier, to become a sentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh district courts' decisions.\n Even if you're looking at not just the number, but the reasons. In other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got nine district judges, they all say we do not depart downward for military service, and you've got one district judge that says we do. It seems to me that if the court of appeals can't review that to bring about some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.\n I think it is not lawless in the sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether in a particular case, the differences it finds are warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case, whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines, has looked at the history and characteristics of that defendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of the crime. And if those reasons satisfy the court that a reasonable judge looking at those facts  \n On my particular case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals? They've got two cases before them. One, the judge departs three years because of military service. The prosecutor appeals. The other, the judge refuses to depart because of military service and the defendant appeals. Should those   what should happen with those two cases?\n I think the same process of review applies to each. And it may result   and that process of review is on the record in that case, would a reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence? And that review may result in both cases being reversed, one, or the other, or neither being reversed.\n Where does that come from as a matter of law? That is, suppose   now you can say I   if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I start with an assumption that Congress did want the court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals create a degree of uniformity. Suppose I start with that assumption and say that's what the guidelines were about and the reason that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among many. After all, it was attached to a bill that was the guideline bill. And indeed, the part we excised was a floor amendment that came along later to make it even tougher. So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is there something in the Constitution that forbids it? That's where I start   I am starting personally with that question in mind, always, if this is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless there's something in the Constitution that forbids it. And is there something in the Constitution that would forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it? Now, just going through the different elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that what the district judge did was unreasonable?\n I think there is a constitutional problem with that. And it is that if   it reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system. And I think if there is to be an effectively advisory system, sentencing cannot center on the guidelines. The district judge needs to be free to accept or reject that advice and 3553(a), instead of the guidelines, becomes the focal point for sentencing.\n It's not mandatory. It says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now, let's think here. We have 8   7 people on the sentencing commission that have really looked into that. And they think that in an ordinary course with this small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many months. That reflects a lot of thought. Seems reasonable to us. And here the district judge is giving him half that or 40 percent of that without a good reason that we can find. The judge said he did it because it was just one little episode and we think there were many episodes. And that's basically their reason. Now, now   what   the Sixth Amendment forbids that?\n Of course, the court of appeals did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case. In  \n Yeah  \n The Eighth Circuit in this case simply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an extraordinary variance and we are reversing. The district court has to consider the sentencing guidelines and generally that must be part of the reason   elaboration of judgment, so they will necessarily be considered on appeal. But the notion somehow that simply because a sentence is in the guidelines, all disparity problems have been resolved, is clearly not true. As the amici briefs, and our brief have pointed out, even under a mandatory guidelines system, racial disparity increased, regional disparity increased. It's disparity that individualized sentencing, the judicial discretion necessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing, can counteract. And that is genuine uniformity. As   as you pointed out in the Koon decision, or the Koon pointed out borrowing your language from Rivera, the district court's special competence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is exactly the kind of information the sentencing commission needs to determine whether a guideline works or doesn't work.\n Aren't you really saying that the most weight that the guidelines can be given, or guidelines can be   is that   I apologize for my voice   the most weight the guidelines can be given is, is the weight of necessary advertence? The guidelines, in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). The rest of them say individualized sentencing. The guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the guidelines. Therefore, in order to   to break this, in effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I think the most that you can concede is that before a district judge sentences finally, he must show that he has considered the value of uniformity as something different from individualized sentencing, but that's as much as he can be required to do. Is that a fair statement of your position?\n Yeah. And I think 3553(a), in fact   I expect Mr. Dreeben to say this   talks about uniformity, twice, in the sense that both 3553(a)(4), which requires consideration of the guidelines, and 3553(a)(6) talks about unwarranted  \n Yes. I   I stand corrected here. I'm sorry.\n But I agree with you that it is a consideration   and I'm not talking about a check list. I'm not saying that we just use a list and that's enough. There has to   I think sentencing under an advisory system requires reason and judgment. We tried to stress in our brief that judgment is somehow different. It may involve fact-finding but is not the determinant, the automatic jury kind of finding that the guidelines require.\n Well, as one of the themes that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over time. I assume they would be adjusted to be more precise, but then we are right back where we started because you want to give the guidelines very little effect. It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing against yourself. If your view is accepted and the result is considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can do is have mandatory minimums.\n I don't believe that, that the results are going to be considerable disparity. Certainly no more disparity than existed under the mandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed particularly. I think indeed there may be more non-guideline sentences, but less true disparity, because it really is kind of idle to talk about disparity unless you are measuring it against something. And 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity is measured  \n Do you think it is idle to talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act was adopted? You remember those days.\n I do remember those days. And I think there are two significant points about that. One, judges sentenced in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act, knowing that their sentence wasn't the real time served. So that a judge may say 20 year sentence knowing the defendant was immediately eligible for parole and was going to get out soon. The real number was parole eligibility sentencing. So that looking at just the actual sentence imposed did not tell you very much about disparity. And none   in the study that the sentencing commission in its amicus cited   that study explicitly said that none of the studies looking at pre-Sentencing Reform Act interjudge disparity considered actual sentences served as opposed to actual sentences imposed.\n Yeah, yeah. But there   you know, we can go back into that, but there was a whole history that people testified, tremendously, no opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge wheel. Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of the judge? And why did you get different sentences across the country which I don't   I've never heard a possibility of explaining that the judges didn't understand what the parole commission was like. That's a different issue. So what   what I'm concerned about is if we followed your position literally, what we're saying is that the Constitution of the United States prevents any effort to create uniform sentences throughout the country for people who different judges   God doesn't tell us what the right sentence is. We don't know. There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range of possible sentences. And you're saying we have to go back to that. And that wasn't   I'm looking, in other words, for you to tell me something that says we don't have to be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid either. And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest with you, and I haven't   I'm not certain I get it.\n I don't believe that sentencing under an effectively advisory system under the standards of appellate review that I've described, which I think is the standard Booker described, is in a sense an empty exercise on appeal, and leading simply  \n Could you describe it again? Because I'm not clear what your answer was to what the appellate court stance is. I take it the appellate court would owe deference to the district court's determination?\n Yes.\n And no particular deference to the guidelines?\n That would   yes, I would agree with that.\n So what is it other than   is this arbitrary and capricious?\n I think that the court of appeals will first look to ensure that there was reasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with 3553(a), that the district court considered all of the factors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary. Secondly, I think that the court of appeals under that deferential standard of review that Booker described would look to see if this is a sentence that a reasonable judge would find sufficient but not greater than necessary on those facts.\n But the   one problem is that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the facts in this very case differently. That is, one as in this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence him to more than 15 months would throw away his life. Another might say it's   it's unreal to assume that he just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had been out on that same street every night for two and a half weeks. So the quantity is much larger. And he was in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less. Those could be reasonable determinations, two different reactions that judges would have to the same set of facts.\n Yes. That is correct. And I think that is what will result under an effectively advisory system. But here we're talking  \n In any case, you   you, you are not driven to the alternative that Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve absolute uniformity. It's very easy. It was what the dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is use facts found by the jury and you can have the sentences as rigid as you like. It is really only, only when you want to let the facts be found by the judge that you come into the difficulty that, that we're arguing about. But it's certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there is no way to achieve determinate sentencing. There certainly is.\n I agree, Justice Scalia.\n Do you agree? Because I think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing power to the prosecutor, who would determine the sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he introduced and what he charged. So I agree that that might produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only because the prosecutor would have total power to decide what the sentence will be.\n Well, I   I also appreciate the dialogue. And  \n You don't   you don't have to engage in our dispute here. (Laughter.)\n We're pointing out there are problems to every solution. And that's why I'm still looking for the  \n And   and one of the serious problems in the solution that Booker chose is that while judicial discretion, which I think 3553(a) requires and mandates, and an advisory system requires, that, too, doesn't deal with the necessary exercise of prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on the scale, and which the district court, in the day to day work of the criminal system in the courts, in the district courts, has a far greater appreciation for, than a court of appeals would.\n Mr. Dwyer, before we get to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district court   different district judges could act reasonably, one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the other giving 15 months, both of those would be reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal. But one of, one of the arguments that was made by defense counsel here was just there was   there is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack and the penalty for powdered cocaine. Your predecessor thought that was so wrong, he thought it was unconstitutional. I think at the very least you ought to take into account that if this man were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the guideline sentence range would have been six months to a year. Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that disparity. Is a district judge free to say under advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though he possessed powdered cocaine?\n I think that the judge in the obligation of imposing an individual sentence must consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be free to shape and tailor that advice as the circumstances of that case require.\n Well, specifically, can you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him as though he possessed powdered cocaine? Can he do that? Yes or no?\n Yes.\n Even though we know that Congress didn't want that to happen?\n Yes, because I think if the judge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in that case  \n That's got nothing to do with that case. That's got something to do with a judgment apart from the particulars of the case about whether crack should be treated the same as powdered crack cocaine. It's got nothing to do with the individual case.\n Well, I beg to differ, Chief Justice Roberts, because the differences were predicated on assumptions about the type of individuals who would engage in that. And the court in her experience could look at it and say you aren't the typical crack defendant, you are more like the people who come before me who are involved in powdered cocaine, or you don't possess the violence, the weaponry and the other things that justified Congress's decision to create disparate sentences for these two kinds of cocaine.\n Well, I think you ran away from Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit. Let's assume that Congress wants to keep this distinction and let's assume that there's no constitutional problem with the distinction. There might be, but let's assume. Can the judge simply say, I ignore that congressional   congressional judgment is wrong. I'm not going to do that.\n I don't think that the district judge's role is to make categorical pronouncements.\n Is the judge permitted  \n To what extent is the Congress's purpose later than the Congress that enacted the statute we're construing? The statute we're construing was enacted by one Congress and these expressions came later.\n Well, I would resolve the problem by saying that the district judge must consider the guidelines. The district judge doesn't sit in review of the policy. It has to apply it to a specific person. In a particular case, as in Mario Claiborne's, that policy produced a sentence that would have been too great. And the application had some numbers to it, so she said it was more serious because it was a crack cocaine case, you're going to get more than somebody who was involved with powder would get, but you don't need to get as much as the guidelines call for, for the reasons that she expressed on the record at the sentencing. If I could reserve the balance of my time, unless there are other questions?\n Thank you, Mr. Dwyer. Mr. Dreeben.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court in Booker concluded that the remedial severing of the statute's provision for mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the statute constitutional. It further implied a standard of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on appeal, and it did not elaborate what that reasonableness requirement means. The Government submits that the best interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's original intent of minimizing and eliminating unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly situated defendants.\n As closely as it can, and the \"as it can\" depends upon violation of the Sixth Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury. Suppose in this case the court of appeals instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it? And then in the next case that comes up involving what was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of cocaine powder rather than crack, okay? Suppose in the next case it would have been 30 grams of powder. And the district court judge once again departs just the way the departure was here, and the court of appeals says no, that departure is unreasonable. You now have circuit law which says 30 grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams, you're entitled to a lesser sentence. Okay? Why isn't   why haven't we fallen back into the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan? You have fact findings being made by the judge. It's a judge who decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams. What difference does it make whether that factual difference produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a series of opinion by a court of appeals? Isn't the Sixth Amendment equally violated?\n Justice Scalia, as I think we talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals does is essentially function as a sentencing commission, literally prescribing particular levels of punishment for recurring sets of facts. The Government's submission here is not that the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a proportionality principle. A proportionality principle will look to all of the facts of the case and will try to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in response to all of the facts and circumstances that the judge articulated within  \n But if you have two cases that are in other respects similar, and the court of appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence.\n Well, he doesn't, Justice Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same level of leniency or any leniency at all. That judge will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at the totality of the facts and conclude whether a sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable sentence. And unlike a situation that some of us might prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the system of reasonableness review on top of advisory guidelines will not produce perfect levels of consistency. And what the defendant is entitled to under the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing that if the law says if I commit this crime and these are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial entitlement. That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles you. But no defendant who commits a crack offense can say that even after a series of court of appeals rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness. That defendant will not know whether the judge that he or she appears in front of will give the same kind of weight to those facts as some other judge did who was affirmed or reversed. Nor will that judge be able to say what is the constellation of policy and factual reasons that this particular judge will find in announcing the judge's sentence. So I don't think that a proportionality principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. And I don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or any other part of the statute. What the Court is left with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I submit it should ask the same question that it asked in Booker itself: Which alternative, the Petitioner's alternative in this case or the Government's, conforms more closely to Congress's original claim in the Sentencing Reform Act? The Petitioner's version of appellate review as I understand it is very light review, if at all, of the substance of what the district judge does. It may reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a second degree murderer, I think probation is the appropriate sentence. Perhaps the Petitioner would concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away, Petitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine whether a particular sentence is reasonable. And that is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when eight of them have adopted this proportionality principle.\n May I ask this question: It seems to me that in sentencing there are two different broad categories of decision that the judge has to make, one involving the severity of the crime, and the other the characteristics of the particular offender. And might it not be the case that you give a greater presumption of following the guidelines when you're talking about the severity of the offense, and a greater deference to the trial judge when you're evaluating the factors of the individual that might affect the sentence? There might be a difference in the  \n I think at a high level of generality, that is true. Because what the sentencing commission is good at is taking paradigmatic circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that will transfer into a sentence. And what the strength of the district judge is is looking at the defendant in front of that particular judge and seeing how that person's characteristics may map onto the policies of sentencing. But I don't agree that that distinction would support a two-track form of appellate review that would give the district judge greater deference to take personal characteristics into account and to impose widely varying sentences. That is exactly the situation that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when any district judge could choose whatever policies of sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and impose a widely disparate sentence. And as the Court well knows, there was no appellate review of that exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the judge didn't exercise discretion at all. Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same sentence. That would not take into account the full range of facts and factors that are present in the sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an exercise of discretion. But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era, the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what facts mattered. If we continue with that same sort of deference on appeal in the Booker remedial opinion, then it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some consistency and uniformity in the way district judges impose sentencing.\n What do you think about taking some of the Rivera ideas   I'm slightly hypothesizing this   and following up with what Justice Stevens said. You'd say look, one thing a district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe the guideline is right for a typical case. And I think this is a typical case. And I won't follow the guideline. You couldn't think those three things?\n I agree.\n So one big power a judge has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to say the guideline itself is unreasonable. So we're   let's just say   and there if they say that, the district judge could decide whether or not, the court of appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not reasonable. But leave those cases aside. I imagine they'll be few and far between. Now we take one they assume is reasonable. And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three things. One, to give the kind of thing that   the reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits is reasonable for a typical case. So what's the kind of thing that leads you to think yours is not typical? And he says it. And then he has the evidence as to the related facts. And then he has the degree of departure. As to the first thing, the court of appeals could review it and decide whether it is or is not the kind of thing. As to the second and third, they also could review it but only after giving considerable weight to what the district judge thinks about the case in front of him. Now maybe that's   I mean, you might not have a reaction to that. I'd have to sort of think about it.\n Well, Justice Breyer, if the system that you're describing is a replica of the system that existed under Koon versus United States  \n Not quite  \n   then it runs into the same problem that led to the constitutional problem in Booker. Where I think I would amend Your Honor's proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe what I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the reasons why, in the pre-Sentencing   in the pre-Booker system, that could have been problematic legally. Today, it is not forbidden. But what it should be subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal that take a look at what are the reasons that the district judge articulated for that sentence.\n Why, why do we assume that the district judge cannot depart from the guideline recommendation unless he thinks the guideline recommendation is unreasonable? He doesn't   does he have to find it's unreasonable? There can certainly be two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation to select the guidelines sentence, is he?\n That's correct.\n So he doesn't have to determine that it's unreasonable. I don't think we should approach the discussion as though that's, that's the situation.\n I do think, though, that the Court should be concerned about each district judge formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing guidelines and then applying them in the court to the cases that appear on that judge's docket without any check on appellate review to ensure that, although the sentence might be in some possible world reasonable, it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission has prescribed and what other district judges are doing. If there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the Sentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a reasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial opinion thought it was accomplishing. What the Booker remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was providing an important mechanism that Congress itself had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron out sentencing differences. And our submission is that inherently means some form of substantive proportionality review.\n That's the other thing I'm not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means. That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something, but proportional to what? I mean, I can think of two problems. One problem, of course, is that the chart in the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to 10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to 30, it's 2 years. Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just have nothing to do with your reason for departure. You might have added on something for having a gun and your reason for being lenient might have to do with the person's having a gun. So you're going to say it make a difference whether you were high up or whether you were low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to do with whether you're high up or whether you were low down? You see? It doesn't actually work, I don't think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to say what's proportional.\n I think what is proportional is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that have been using this rule have not had a great deal of difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and have a sense of is this a significant deviation away from what the guidelines would actually describe.\n Well, why use the word \"proportional,\" because the other thing is what the Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot? And if he has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot just as much as it might justify a little?\n If the sentencing court articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the district court to articulate the reasons why the sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an appropriate sentence under 3553(a).\n Mr. Dreeben, if we could focus on the facts of this case and what the district court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality judgment, too. She said this is a young man. It's his first offense. He has a good family relationship, a good work record. I am making a determination that will put him away for a significant amount of time. But I'm trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away. That was the judgment that she made. She tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15 months, but that would not be so long that it would put him out of touch with his children and his wife and his work. Now, in   by some measures that would be entirely reasonable. But on your measure, it isn't reasonable.\n That's right. And I think, Justice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of articulating a justification for the sentence than the judge's own articulation, which did not focus on family separation and employment to the degree that you have now articulated it. What the judge did was focus on the quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't have any criminal history and that he qualified for the safety valve. She also said, without specifying any other cases, that other cases that have come before my court have had   you know   perhaps larger quantity of drugs and very different sentences. When a court of appeals is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is reasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we know anything, for example, about what this judge is saying about other cases with other drug quantities? There's no specifics in the record that enable the Court of Appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of that observation. It's also relevant for the court of appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken into account all of the factors that this judge has previously noted and what has happened in the sentence is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence for reasons that the commission already took into account. Now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from relying on those facts, but it does mean that the farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.\n But you did leave out what   she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I would be throwing him away. And I take it what she was saying by that is it would be   he would be incarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate into the community.\n Well, this brings me to my last point about this particular sentencing, which is that in this very case Judge Jackson looked at the defendant. She said, candidly I don't know really very much about you other than what I've learned about in the presentence report and I can't tell whether you're unlucky or you're stupid, and then effectively gave him a sentence that reflected, you know, a tremendous indulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a wakeup call and nothing more. What she ignored is his own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a street corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine, that he was arrested and placed into the State system, put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug court, in essence being said, here's your chance, you know, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you, we're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate with your family, and what did the defendant do but get caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack. And on that record   and this is what the court of appeals said   there's a disconnect between the judge's conclusion that, with little information more than what she had in the PSR, the kid deserved leniency versus the fact that he had already had that chance and he had not  \n Yes, but didn't the court of appeals draw the inference that he had been distributing drugs during that 6-month period and that was not supported by the record? Am I wrong on that?\n Well, Justice Stevens, we're not relying on the inference of the  \n Would it have been error for the court of appeals to find a fact like that that was not supported by the record and didn't it do it in this case.\n Well, supported by the record is something of a judgment call. You'd have to assume that Mr. Claiborne was found by the police, 6 months after he had previously been arrested for crack offenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the very first time after his arrest that he had been in possession of drugs, that just he got extremely unlikely, the police caught him.\n And the court of appeals is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in fact distributed during that 6-month period?\n That's right. And I would say that a reasonable fact-finder could draw that conclusion.\n But should the court of appeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the case?\n Not in my view. And I think on this record that's not a fact that we're relying on. It's not a fact that the Government  \n Is it not possibly a fact that would justify the conclusion that they committed error?\n This aspect of the court of appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the judgment that it reached, which is correct.\n It may not have been essential, but it may have contributed to their judgment.\n It may have, but what they did not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist even though he had no criminal history. He had been previously arrested for crack distribution crimes. He had admitted that this was not   the occasion of his arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal crack. He'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months. And the judge essentially turned all of those facts off. She did not really factor that into her sentence at all. And the court of appeals, although it may have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had treated him as, the record does indeed support the court of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant, despite his criminal history, really looks more like a recidivist. And when you're talking about a defendant whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5 years, but who gets out of that sentence because he satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is a first-time offender and meets certain other requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been substantially reduced under the guidelines because of the safety valve and because of his criminal history. And the judge basically said: I'm going to take a chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than what the guidelines described. Our view is the judge can look at the facts she looked at, but she went down to a level that is productive of unwarranted disparity.\n May I ask just one other question? I do not understand you to argue that the court of appeals can apply a presumption of unreasonableness just because there's a departure.\n That's correct. We're not arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal. We're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a guidelines sentence. For an out of guidelines sentence there is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the court of appeals under a proportionality analysis would look and require increasingly strong reasons with the increasing degree of variance from  \n That's the part, they said that. An extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances. What worries me about that it sounds like a slogan. I would think an extraordinary reduction must be supported by whatever reasons that justify the extraordinary reduction, period. And it also sounds like you're going to start getting a mechanical set of charts and things, which is going to be a true nightmare, and if we really were to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force of generative law which would worry me quite a lot because I just think it's too complex to reduce to a formula. What you want is a reason that supports the sentence. It is  \n I think you want a better reason for a sentence that is farther away from some mean.\n Better than what? Better than justifies it?\n Perhaps the best way to do this is to give a example. Suppose that the shoe were on the other foot. Suppose that Judge Jackson had looked at this defendant and said, you know, this defendant did not learn from his experience. He was given leniency in the State court. He didn't take advantage of that opportunity. His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm going to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, I'm going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she said a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence. I submit that in that circumstances the Petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this deviation is unreasonable. And I have no problem with a Petitioner making that argument if that's what happens to his or her client. My problem is that without that kind of anchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality review, a court of appeals has almost nothing to work with.\n But what happens when that case   it goes back down to the district court. The district court says well, okay, not 10 years. Nine years. Okay? It goes back up. I mean, you know, when do we end this game? Or does the court of appeals take over the sentencing function and specify   you know, five years?\n Justice Scalia, I don't think that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a sentence. There have been a couple of instances where courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on this particular constellation of facts. I think that reflect as sense of potential impatience with a ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge, and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day lower. Another solution to that problem would be reassignment to a different judge who would start with a clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion and apply the section 3553 factors. We are not suggesting that the court of appeals should assume the sentencing role here. All we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to identify and select unreasonable sentences versus reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark, it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their tasks. And if the courts of appeals can do that, can look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the farther that it goes outside the guidelines range, without violating the statute and without violating the Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the Court to ask at that point is which approach, that approach of proportionality, or and approach that basically says appellate review is procedural only, absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of uniformity and consistency.\n Well, it wouldn't be, just be procedural only. You   you could say procedural plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on which the district court was   was proceeding. So you, if you could find that the determination that this was just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.\n That   that is true. But I submit that   I would like to hear what Petitioner has to say. If Petitioner's client had been given 10 years in this case, I have no doubt that Petitioner would be arguing that's an unreasonable sentence. But I don't see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court has articulated a rationale that's consistent with section 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts, unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the analysis. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Dwyer, you have two minutes remaining.\n I believe that Justice Breyer put his finger on one of the central problems with the Government's proposed rule. And that is what does it mean? The Government talks about substantial variances in Petitioner's case. The court of appeals spoke of it as extraordinary variances. And the Government doesn't suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or means something different from extraordinary. And we've already demonstrated in our brief why relying on percentages as the court of appeals also did, is pointless, because, one, if   the arithmetic gets very complicated at the low end and the percentages just don't make any sense from a proper application of a rule of law. The Government's proposal, apart from having no basis in the statute and no basis in Booker, is just not susceptible of any kind of application because nobody really knows what it means.\n What about Mr. Dreeben's parting challenge? What are you going to do if your client gets 10 years? You're going to argue that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines, right?\n I'm certainly going to argue that under the facts and the record before the Court, that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not greater than necessary. And I think the absence of a prior record, the young man's work history, all of those factors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his age, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision, could not possibly support a 10-year sentence. And you know, it is easy to do this in a, in a hypothetical sort of way. But the district judge   and this was a very experienced district judge   looking at the person in the eye, made a call based on judgment. And that call was not treated with any respect in the court of appeals. It was sloganeered away as an extraordinary variance. And   because the court of appeals focused only on the guidelines. The   this Court in crafting the appellate standard can't just look to determine what Congress might have intended because of the constitutional problem that lurks behind it. And that constitutional problem is a resumption of mandatory guidelines. Thank you very much.\n Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Petitioner is before this Court because he followed an order of the district court. He filed his notice of appeal within the time authorized by the district court. It was only when the matter came before the court of appeals was it raised that the district court apparently had no authority to grant a 17-day extension, although it specified a specific date rather than the 14 days in connection with the case.\n Yes, it was authorized by the district court in the sense the district court put it on a piece of paper. It wasn't authorized because the district court had no authority to extend that.\n The district court put it on there. When you look at the actual entry itself, it's a handwritten entry. There's no way of telling from the handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on the docket on the same date because all you have is the handwritten entry, February 10, file your appeal by February 27, which is unusual in a civil case because normally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't get a directive from the Court that you have 30 days to file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with this. So I don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a directive from a court.\n But you knew that 14 days was the maximum because the motion asking for it cited and quoted from the rule.\n Well, that   we did cite from the rule. That is correct. When the order came out   well, first of all, we were glad to get the order to allow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just looking at the date, something had to be done. And Of course, we filed on one day before the end date  \n What if, what if the District Court gave you an extra month? Would your argument still be the same, that that   because the court set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?\n Well, then you get into certain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the circumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant rely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the court gave to it. But here certainly this order is not unreasonable. It's certainly within the confines. And you have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal by this date.\n But wouldn't a reasonable lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I made this motion for extension of time. The rule said 14 days; this judge obviously made a slip. He miscalculated. Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order, say the judge probably made a mistake? So I better, if I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?\n Well, looking back, that is probably correct. But looking at the order, and the way it came out, and the fact that you know, the   the rule allowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at the end date of the order, make sure the notice of appeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that the party who is adversely affected by it may object on that basis, saying Judge, you have no authority to do this, what are you doing in connection with  \n Why isn't   this is just a notice of appeal. Why would you   why not file it the same day? In terms of looking at it from some equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the difference between the 14 days and the days allowed. What   why, why would you delay filing the notice of appeal?\n Well, the only reason for delaying it is obviously workload. And you don't want to get all briefs due within a short period of time, once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular case, because you have time limits for getting the record, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of appeals going out   not in this Court, but you know there were a number of appeals going on. And my normal practice is you know, file your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable appeals time.\n Does it make   does it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve provision? In other words, you've got the 30 days to file; and then this rule allows you to   it's a safety valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14 days. And now it seems to me that you're asking for a safety valve on top of a safety valve. And I wonder if there's some point where you cut off the   allowing an out for missing the deadline.\n Well, I suppose at some point, someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be unreasonable in connection with that. I think the safer thing is just to put the order down, say application, reopen the appeal time, granted. And then it would cause someone to go you know, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is allotted under the rule in connection with the case. But I don't think it's unreasonable; in these circumstances we're only talking about three days to do an act. The act was done in two days.\n Well, but as soon as you start talking about an exception from the provision in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of applications and there are going to be a lot of different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last day. Once that   it seems to me, you open it up for an indeterminate ruling.\n Well, this is an equitable rule in itself. Because it allows something where an appeal time has expired, can you come in and show the circumstances, one, you were not notified, which obviously the court did. The other side's prejudiced  \n Well it is an equitable rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.\n Well, that's   that's once it's granted. It's not, the time limit is 180 days or the seven day after you received or became aware actual notice  \n No, but Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical. In other words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to provide a safety valve. But they also appreciated that you can't have it open-ended. So they did impose limits on the   if you want to call it equitable exception to the 30-day rule. And it seems to me that you sort of restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if you allow further equitable departures from their, their rule.\n Well, I think in past cases the Court has always recognized there are deadlines but there are exceptions to deadlines. And the most compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at this particular time. And you know, it's coming from a judicial officer, it's not coming from someone miscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time when it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10 days run in connection with the case. Because in civil litigation you are not given any specific time to do an act. Criminal cases are a little bit different. You are told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed in connection with a case. You do not have in civil, when you get your final order   you know you have 30 days to do it.\n Mr. Mancino, your position here is that this rule is not jurisdictional. Now, what   what are the consequences of that? I take it that that would mean that the court of appeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether the matter has been filed too late?\n Well, I believe  \n Right? If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can   can take a late, a late filing?\n Well, I think when the court of appeals does that, I think in all fairness, they should advise the parties in advance that they we're considering this on our own, that the appeal was out of time, and would you like to  \n No, no, but I'm asking whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that? If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can just assume it's okay and go ahead, right?\n Correct. Because I think they've waived any   the other side obviously has waived or forfeited any right to object to the   you know, to the  \n And you need an objection or else it's, it will be okay?\n I'm sorry?\n And you need an objection or else it will be all right?\n Yes. The objection in this case came   you know, in the  \n That means that a rule   that   14 days is really a rule left to the discretion of the district judge. If the district judge feels like giving a little more, this would be no control, unless the opposing side objects; is that right?\n Well, I   I believe it does call for a timely objection by somebody to say something, rather than to just sit back and let it expire, knowing that someone did something that they should not do in connection with  \n Suppose you have problems at home. I don't know, you have an illness at home. And you ask counsel for the other side, you know, I know it's a 14-day limit, but would you give me 20 days? Right? And opposing counsel being as friendly as they are nowadays   (Some laughter.)\n   the other, the other side would say sure, take 20 days. Okay? So you prepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs off on it, gives you 20 days. That's okay then, right?\n Well I  \n Because the other side's agreed. He won't object on the court of appeals. And suddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the rule says 14.\n Well, there you have somewhat advance knowledge that you're doing something possibly contrary to a rule. But then you have the issue of once you do it, are you forfeiting your right to object and claim a deficiency in the process. Here you're only   what you're doing  \n Well, I mean, that   that may, that may be true of this stage; but Justice Scalia's question points up the problem of what do we do if we write this case? How do we formulate this rule? And if we say that it's not jurisdictional, not binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow the hypothetical that he puts to you.\n Well, I believe you can come up with all sorts of scenarios. What I think is the thing  \n That's why we're wondering how to write the opinion. (Laughter.)\n And where did the litigant reasonably rely upon an order of the court, which apparently the court had authority to issue, regardless of the court making a mistake or doing something intentionally  \n And the person who did the reliance was you, I guess?\n Yes, that's correct.\n And is it correct that   who   was this litigant represented by counsel during the period when he didn't get the notice of the September 9 order?\n Yes. I filed the habeas petition. I did anything in connection with the case.\n So neither the, neither the prisoner nor you received any notice of the first goof up?\n Well, the first   well, we received notice of the judgment on the merits. Then we filed a motion to alter judgment or for a new trial. It was not, the order overruling the motion to alter or amend judgment or the motion for a new trial date was not received. And the clerk's docket showed it wasn't mailed out.\n I see.\n But in the, in that court, there was a transitioning to this electronic filing, which not everybody was set up at that particular time; so apparently the order may have only gone to   on the electronic filing system to those who were set up, and we were not set up on that thing. But the court still had the obligation to send it out. The court found that the clerk did not send it out. The clerk found that, or the court found that we did not have notification. And the court found that the other side is not prejudiced by any application.\n Would your   would your proposed exception, does it work the other day? I mean, let's say the district court entered this order and set a date certain for you to file the notice of appeal, and only gave you seven days on his count rather than 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other words within the 14 days given under the rule. Would you be out of luck because of what the district court set out in its order as what's binding, as opposed to what the resume says? Or could you rely on the fact the rule says you get 14 days?\n Well I would believe you could then argue that the rule says that, the judge was wrong in   you know   in truncating your appeal time to file the appeal.\n Why wouldn't the same approach work the other way? The rule says 14 and the judge was wrong to give you more?\n Well, because the exceptions to all of these time deadlines, you have cases from this Court where people untimely file a motion for a new trial. A new trial motion by rule has to be timely filed in order to toll your time. And there have been cases where the motion for new trial has been untimely filed. The other side didn't say anything. And then when the ruling is made, the appeal is filed within the appropriate time. And this Court has sanctioned that procedure in connection. I see no difference here, where a litigant before a court, the court issues an order, you look at the order. And you abide by the order in connection with the case. They do have a reasonable reliance in the case. And in looking back later on, in connection with the   the issue, in connection with the case.\n You know sometimes, sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case that they   that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.\n Well  \n And sometimes in reliance on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no jurisdiction here; too bad.\n Well  \n Even though the court said it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the district judge. District judges make mistakes.\n Well, that's a whole   I believe that's a whole different scenario than presented here. That goes to the subject matter  \n It's even worse, it seems to me. I mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial and so forth.\n Right.\n But if it's jurisdictional, we have to say, you know, too bad. Yes, you were misled by the judge. In reliance on the district judge, you expended a lot of time and money, but there was no jurisdiction. And that's the end of the matter.\n Well, the rule I always remember from law school is that parties cannot voluntarily confer jurisdiction on a court that does not have it. And the court, at any point, if they do not have subject matter jurisdiction, is free to dismiss the case whether it's at trial level, the appeal level, or whatever. This is not that situation. Obviously, the court by the rule could look into this matter. The court by the rule could grant relief in connection with this matter. It's a question whether the three days  \n I know I could find this out by looking at a calendar. Do you remember what day of the week February 24th was, or 26th?\n I believe  \n We don't have a weekend problem, do we?\n I believe it was not   I don't believe it was a weekend, no.\n14 days after the date when the district court's order is entered.\n When it's entered. That's correct.\n And was there a submission or an implication in your remarks that you thought that the order was not entered until three days later?\n No.\n Is there an entry   is there a time entry on the dock   on court's order?\n No. It's a handwritten one that doesn't say anything  \n I know that it's a handwritten one. But that that   that shows how long he has to appeal. is there a date when the order was put on the docket? Does that show on this sheet?\n No. There's nothing from the clerk indicating   on the docket there is, but nothing on the document that was sent, because the document only was sent   it was just handwritten over the   on top of the motion, so there was no way of telling when it was entered. Because you look back at the history of this case, when the court dismissed the original petition, the court had a date on it. It was only 18 days later that it was actually entered by the clerk, and of course that triggered the time for asking for reconsideration. So   but  \n What about the weekends? I mean, maybe the judge   I   it looks from my calendar   I wondered what day of the week it was. You don't remember. 2/10, February 10, 2004, what day of the week was it?\n That I cannot answer.\n It looks like it was the middle of the week. So maybe there were one or two weekends. So maybe what the judge's mistake was, he didn't know how to count the weekend rule.\n Well, what I think was done  \n Which may not be jurisdictional, the weekend rule.\n What I believe is that this was sent out by mail. So they had, you know, the three-day mail rule, and that's how you came to the 14 days in connection with the   put in the 17-day limit on  \n Maybe Arabic numerals aren't jurisdictional either.\n They're not. A numeral is not jurisdictional. What's   what's   what's the three-day mail rule?\n Well, normally if you are allowed to do an act by mail, you have three days, you can serve a party and then you have three days to file with the court as part of the Civil Rules. I sort of think that's what the judge   because this was going out by mail   he probably didn't get   I wish I would have saved the envelope, but I don't have the envelope, but it probably didn't get to my office for three days anyway.\n Speaking of the three-day mail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this was that it actually was entered, took effect as of three days later.\n Well, there's really no   looking at the document, there's no way of telling that. That is correct. There's no way of telling that, and I believe that was probably the reasoning of the court that, you know, it took three days to get mail because you didn't get   it wasn't sent out last time, obviously you did not get the mail the last time, so he added the three days, and then you have the 14 days to, you know, perfect or file your notice of appeal to get it to the court in this case. So  \n All of that might have   all those things might have been going on in the judge's mind, but you don't contest that the 14-day period was not complied with? You don't have an argument that you complied with the 14-day period?\n No, I do not. We're relying to the exceptions, and there's a number exceptions on deadlines that have come out. We have the equitable tolling, we have the waiver, forfeiture issue. And, you know, in this case, specific assurance by a court which in a past opinion seemed to control the date, where a judge gave you a specific assurance that you could do something in connection with the case. The old Harris Truck case is where the lawyer was on vacation. The judge said well, I'll give you some extra time. Even though they knew of the judgment, they knew the time would run, he said I'll give you extra time to file the appeal because you want to contact the lawyer who was on vacation. The court of appeals then said well, the rule didn't apply because you knew of the order, so   but that was overlooked even though by time calculation, everybody was out of time. The Eberhart case, they were out of time because the motion for new trial was filed untimely, which under the rule required a timely filing of a motion for a new trial in order to toll your appeal time. So this, obviously the motion to reopen was timely filed, was filed within the 180 days required by the rule. The other side was served. The other side had no objection to it and didn't oppose it. The real issue when you look at an equitable   sort of an equitable rule like this, is the other side prejudiced, and obviously they are not prejudiced.\n One of the things I think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that there would be a point at which the prevailing party in the district court could know with certainty there wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that. It's not open-ended. Under your rule where the actual time for filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never really quite have that assurance, would they?\n Well, unless the court specifically granted to the litigant a specific period of time, and you know, normally litigants and lawyers do not ignore what the court says. At least I think as, you know, anyone   if this court said that, you have a right to reasonably rely on what the court said. And it certainly wasn't an unreasonable period of time that the court was giving in the case. It wasn't  \n Well, what would be an unreasonable period of time if the two or three days is not? Would another 10 days?\n Well, if you go back to the rules, you're going into the six months, 180 days, and then, you know, you would say something. Or if the court, you know, gave you a year or something by mistake, you know, it would   you know, that something does not sound right here. And then you would look at it. At least if that were the case, you could probably go in and get the court to reconsider, bring it to the attention of the court. Your Honor, we did not have all of this time. Did you make a mistake? You can always correct mistakes. But that was not done here, it was not done by the respondent in this case because they didn't   the respondent did not object to the application to reopen the appeal, did not say anything  \n But the respondent said he had no reason at that time to believe that you wouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days. So if they made an objection, the moment the judge put down a date that's 17 days later, the judge might say that's premature.\n Well then, the judge may have said well, I don't   look at the rule. I don't have it. I'm going to redraft the order, vacate my order and put a proper order on in connection with the case. It would seem to me that at some point in the appellate process, because when you look at the history that the Sixth Circuit in this case   at least when the court then granted a certificate of appealability, you would think the respondent would   what are   why are you granting a certificate of appealability when you told us we have no jurisdiction over this case, or at least from the two orders anyway, they said they had jurisdiction over the February 10th order that   on the appeal. And the   then the certificate of appealability was denied, and normally that would end the case. The court granted the   my motion for reconsideration, and then granted certain issues that could be briefed on the merits. But once the court granted the certificate of appealability, it seemed to me that the other side, well, what is happening here?\n Mr. Mancino, I take it that what you are really proposing is sort of a rule that if   if counsel could reasonably be misled to overlook the mistake by the court, that your reliance upon the court's mistake should   should, in fact, be respected. It's kind of a rule of reasonably misleading; is that about right?\n I believe so.\n I mean, that's how we distinguish your case on your view from the case in which you get 180 days instead of 14?\n Right. Sort of, you know, reasonably reliant, is it fair.\n You think we should have a rule of reason rather than a per se rule. (Laughter.)\n That's the prior case, because they made that.\n Let me ask this question: Is the order on page 151 of the joint appendix, just those three lines, that's the entire order that the judge entered? It just says granted, and motion  \n That is what's handwritten on the original documents. That's it.\n He did not make the findings that the rule requires?\n No. But presumably you would assume that those findings are subsumed within the rule because the judge found in our favor. The judge denied the motion to vacate part of it but granted the reopening to vacate, and of course on the  \n Because the motion requires  \n   motion to vacate, you have 30 days to appeal.\n The rule requires that he make three specific findings which he did not make.\n He did not make it, but you assume that the judge did by granting the motion, and nobody else said anything about it anyway. I reserve the time.\n Thank you, counsel. Mr. Marshall?\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner's failure to meet the 14-day statutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is fatal to his case for three reasons. First, the 14-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and Federal district courts do not have the power to enlarge this time period. Second, the 14-day rule was not forfeited by the state of Ohio and may be raised by the court sua sponte in any event. Third, even if there could be some sort of limited equitable exception to the 14-day time requirement, the petitioner here falls far short of demonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary relief. Let me explain why. The petitioner's claim that notice of appeal time requirements are not jurisdictional contradicts 150 years of practice, countless lower court decisions, settled congressional understanding as to the meaning of its governing  \n What type of jurisdiction are you speaking of? It's certainly not Federal jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter jurisdiction, like a specific case arising under Federal law. What kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?\n Your Honor, I think it is its own form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way that final judgments on appeals are subject matter jurisdiction. And the reason why is that notice of appeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense, in that they transfer the locus of the case from one court to another. In the appellate system, there's actually a changing of the jurisdiction, and the notice of appeal is that triggering mechanism. And in that sense, it is classically jurisdictional and different from the other kinds of time limits that this Court addressed in Kontrick, in versus Eberhart because those took place within a particular court system, the district court system, where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction triggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the other.\n Isn't that just a word game? It's jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction from one court to the other. Why should that be   why does that make it jurisdictional?\n Well, I think, Your Honor, the same way that final judgments are. I mean, final judgments are a jurisdictional prerequisite to transfer from one case to another. The second reason, Your Honor, by the way, is congressional, is the congressional reenactment of the notice of appeal time deadlines, which also indicates that Congress treats these  \n Can you think of anything that's enacted by Congress as jurisdictional?\n No, Your Honor, but when there is a background, as there is in this case, of 150 years of practice where Congress has enacted against that background, it is presumed to be jurisdictional. And I'd also point out that with respect to this Court's jurisdiction, the Court has treated petitions for certiorari as jurisdictional in civil cases because there is a statutory underpinning, but has not treated them as jurisdictional in criminal cases in part because there is not a statutory underpinning.\n Doesn't the latter suggest that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?\n Your Honor, I think the latter recognizes the fact that it doesn't necessarily have to be. That is correct. However, that Congress and this Court can treat such a thing because it is in a   because it is a   because it does transfer the case from one to another. I think that the criminal   that in the certiorari case, with respect to criminal, it might be an indication there that there might be some relation. But I would also suggest that with respect to certiorari practice, you've already   you're already in the appellate mode and you're not dividing the jurisdiction between trial courts and appellate courts. But the quick answer is yes, Your Honor, I don't think it has to be jurisdictional, but certainly it can be jurisdictional. And for 150 years, this Court and Congress has treated this particular division as jurisdictional.\n Well, it seems to me that's what we're back to, that it's long been treated as jurisdictional. But you just said that it's not sufficient that it's been enacted by Congress and it's not sufficient that it transfers the case from one court to another. So we're back just to history, right?\n Well, Your Honor, it's more than just history, because I think Congress reenacting 2107 against this background for 150 years, that this issue has been treated as jurisdictional, puts Congress behind this as well. But here it's also, 150 years is not a matter of  \n The provision of, is it 2107?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Where does that appear in the judicial code? Does it appear under the provisions concerning jurisdiction?\n No, Your Honor. 2107 does not itself mention jurisdiction. However, that is also true with 2101 in respect to this Court's certiorari jurisdiction in civil cases. The word jurisdiction is not mentioned specifically but it  \n But it is under the heading procedure, court procedure, right?\n It's time for appeal to court to proceed.\n Yes, but that's under a chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to jurisdiction.\n Yes, Your Honor. But this Court in Barnhart suggested that in determining whether something is jurisdictional or not, one looks at the context of the particular location. Here this Rule 21   excuse me. Here this statute, 2107, has been enacted and reenacted against the background of this Court consistently saying it's jurisdictional and treating this rule as jurisdictional, and that's since cases as far along as Edmondson.\n You know there have been a spate of cases that said the word \"jurisdiction\" has been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings. And you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is subject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity, is there a federal question?\n Yes, Your Honor, in the same way that amount in controversies are also subject matter.\n But amount in controversy is in 1332. Congress putting it right there together. It says diversity of citizenship plus amount in controversy, all in 1332. Here the limit appears in a statute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.\n Yes, Your Honor. But that statute has been enacted against, as I keep reemphasizing, 150 years of practice, including the Edmondson case in 1869, where the Court on its own motion raised the matter as being jurisdictional and because the time period had not been complied with dismissed the appeal. The question essentially isn't whether we're going to call it jurisdictional or not. The question is the effect of the particular rule. Some of the lower courts call its indications of jurisdiction or a prerequisite to jurisdiction. The question is what the treatment of this particular requirement is and the treatment of this particular requirement consistently for over 150 years has been that it is mandatory, jurisdictional, non-forfeitable, it can be raised by the court sua sponte.\n What characteristics are you asserting follow from calling it jurisdictional in this case?\n Your Honor, the  \n Number one, it can't be waived, right?\n That's correct.\n Number two  \n It's non-forfeitable.\n The court of appeals has to inquire on its own, right?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Anything else?\n Yes, Your Honor. There's no equitable exception to it. There is no equitable exception to it as well if it's jurisdictional. So all of those three attach to the term \"jurisdictional.\" But I also think they could equally attach to the notion that, even if we don't want to call it jurisdictional, if we don't view it as fitting easily within this category of subject matter jurisdiction.\n Except at least as to the second, at least as to the second, I don't know of any matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which is not jurisdictional. That's the one of the three characteristics that I think we have always attached the word \"jurisdictional\" to, I think.\n Well, Your Honor, in Day versus McDonough in dealing with a habeas, with a habeas statute of limitations, this Court approved the court of appeals raising that issue sua sponte, although they   although in that case the Court  \n It may.\n It may.\n But not must.\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Not must. And truly with things we have called jurisdictional, you must, right?\n Yes, Your Honor. However, if the lower courts wanted to play with the language a little bit and call it necessary for the invocation of jurisdiction or a prerequisite  \n We could call it \"quasi-jurisdictional.\" You wouldn't object to that?\n No, Your Honor. As Shakespeare might say, it's not the name. We are interested in the effect, and the effect here has been traditionally enforced over 150 years of court practice.\n Well, what do you think is the  \n How far do you take it? Suppose this ^ slip is not noticed in the court of appeals, and then there's a petition for cert, and some clever law clerk notices that the notice of appeal was filed in 16 days instead of in 14 days. Would the court then have to dismiss for want of jurisdiction?\n Yes, Your Honor. I think it applies in the same way that lack of diversity would apply or lack of a Federal question could apply, as in the Mottley case. Even if it was in front of this Court, if it was recognized in front of this Court, at that time it would   it must be dismissed.\n Let's take it a step further. Let's assume it isn't recognized. Assume he gets his habeas relief, and three years later some eager beaver is culling through the records and says, this guy never should have been in court. Do they rearrest him and put him into prison?\n Your Honor, collateral attacks for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not normally sustained, if that's what the   if I understand your question correctly. So that, for example, in a diversity case, if two years or three years after it proceeds to final judgment somebody realizes that both parties were from the same State, the collateral attack would normally not allow to change that, to change that result. And I would think that the same thing would happen here. If the case had proceeded to final judgment, if there were an error of this type, as with other types of errors in subject matter jurisdiction, there would not be an opening for collateral attack.\n What about something here I hadn't run across, called the unique circumstances doctrine. This Court in Osterneck said this: Where a party has performed a act which if properly done would postpone the deadline for filing his appeal   and indeed that's what happened here; he postponed the deadline for filing his appeal   and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done   and here he did receive specific assurance by a judicial officer that the act was properly done   in those circumstances, you can make a little exception in the interests of justice.\n Well, Your Honor, the unique circumstances doctrine doesn't apply here because there wasn't an act which if requested could have been properly done.\n Yes, yes, the act was that he filed a motion to reopen, which motion to reopen postponed the time of appeal. And two things have to happen with that act. One is you have to get the district judge to agree; and second, you have to file the paper. So that's the act which if properly done would, in fact, have led to the appeal.\n Your Honor, I think that  \n I agree there were two parts to it or two acts, if you want.\n But, Justice Breyer, in this case I think that what would have had to happen is that the Petitioner would have had to move for 17 days in order for the act to be properly done. He moved for 14 days.\n I thought what we were talking about was that if the order had said 14 days instead of 17, then the act would have been properly done. That is, the only reason that   the 16 days, according to Mr. Mancino the only reason he took 16 days was the judge authorized that. If the judge hadn't authorized that, the rule wouldn't have been discarded and he would have filed in 14 days.\n Well, Your Honor, the judge   our argument is in part that the judge had no power to authorize it. If I understand your question, with respect to the unique circumstances doctrine, this doesn't fit in because in the unique circumstances doctrine the litigant actually has to seek a particular type of relief and get granted that relief. The Petitioner here did not seek leave to file his motion of appeal within 17 days. The Petitioner here sought, which is the only thing he could do under the rules, is seek to reopen for 14 days.\n So he hasn't received, just quoting from Osterneck, he hasn't received assurance that the act has been properly done?\n That's right.\n In other words, if he came back and said, was my notice of appeal timely or something, and the judge at that point ruled, then it might come under that provision. But this is just   prospectively, he could have filed this timely even after the judge issued the order. In other words, he could have filed it on the 14th day. He didn't have to wait until the 17th day.\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n Why does that matter? I mean, also Osterneck I happened to guess involved a case that took place on Tuesday. This case took place on Thursday. I mean, I grant you the language literally you could say doesn't quite fit it, but so what? The purpose of this Osterneck I take it is to have a very narrow exception where a judge tells you basically what to do, and you follow what the judge said, and then, lo and behold, they hit you with this jurisdictional thing and you didn't get it right. Now, that seems to be its purpose, and the language is very close, so why not follow it?\n Your Honor, the purpose of the unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a license to litigants to rely on district court errors.\n That would be the very narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique circumstances doctrine. (Laughter.)\n I notice the court applied it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique circumstances.\n That's right, Your Honor.\n May I ask this question. Supposing there was a dispute as to whether the order had been entered on February 10 or February 12. Say his handwriting was illegible. Would that be a dispute that would remain open throughout the appellate process?\n Your Honor, the question is when the clerk of court would have entered for the entry of judgment.\n If he'd entered this order on February 12 or 13   I forget which day it was   the appeal would have been timely?\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n And I'm just   and the order was defective because it didn't make findings required by the rule. And I'm just wondering, supposing it was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered. Would the party then be entitled to rely on the date, February 27th, set in the order, or would he have a duty to investigate and find out exactly when the judge signed the order?\n I think the key question, Your Honor, I think is when the   when the order is entered into the docket, which is done by the clerk of course. I think that is the triggering time.\n My question is what if that's somewhat ambiguous? A busy court, he handed it to the clerk and the clerk didn't enter it into the docket. You're not sure, there's a fact dispute about that.\n Your Honor, that's a different case. The beginning time period is a beginning case, if there was some ambiguity there.\n I understand. I'm just wondering what your view is, how should courts resolve that kind of dispute? Should that be a dispute that remains open throughout the appellate process/ There's a factual dispute as to when the judge signed order.\n Yes, Your Honor. Again, the factual dispute is when the  \n If he had written here, instead of \"2-10,\" he had written down \"2-12,\" then the prosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the wrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?\n Your Honor, I think the question at that point is what is the time period entered into the formal docket, and what is the actual judgment.\n And that's ambiguous, I'm saying. That's ambiguous.\n If for some reason the court records are jumbled for some reason or another and nobody can determine when that entry of order is, that's a different case.\n In that case, you then rely on the February 27 date in the order? Then it must be permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by 2-27? In such a case it would be okay.\n Again, Your Honor, the critical thing with the rule period is the time period from the entry of judgment.\n I know, and I say it's hard to figure out when the order was actually written down in the docket.\n I think that the question that would be required then was for whoever was filing the notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the docket is. If that's ambiguous, I think it's obligatory on the litigant to err on the side of caution, Your Honor.\n And not rely on the 2-27 date.\n I would certainly suggest that a litigant argue on   err on the side of caution if at all.\n Justice Breyer quoted from the Osterneck case. There was another statement of the rule which goes like this: There is a sharply honed exception covering cases in which the trial judge has misled a party who could have and probably would have taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct rather than incorrect information. This case fits right into that description, doesn't it?\n No, Your Honor. The case that they're citing to is Thompson, and in Thompson what occurred in that case is that the litigant in that case  \n The case that I'm reading from is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against United States. It does cite Thompson.\n Thompson is the case, Thompson   this Court has not relied on the unique circumstances doctrine in 40 years. Buy in Thompson what occurred was the Petitioner requested a new trial untimely, but was told by the court that they had timely requested a new trial. Because they were informed that they were entitled to a new trial, they did not do something else, which was file the notice of appeal. So the court basically sent them down the wrong avenue. Here there was no wrong avenue that the court   that the litigant was being sent down.\n But they would have filed that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said, your motion for a new trial is untimely. It seems to me the same as in this case. The judge said: Your motion is timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much later. Fine. If the judge had said, your motion is untimely and you know you've got to get your notice of appeal in sooner rather than later. Similarly, here the judge said, well, you've got until 17 days later. If the judge had done right and said the 14-day period, then surely Mr. Mancino would have filed within that period.\n But, Your Honor, there is nothing that the court did that prevented the litigant here from filing on time. There was nothing that would have prevented the litigation here from filing within the 14-day period. And when  \n There was nothing in Thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.\n Except in Thompson, Your Honor, he was told that he had the right to proceed on a motion for new trial. If he had   Your Honor, I see that my time is up.\n You can finish your answer.\n In Thompson, Your Honor, the difference is that   that the litigant was sent down a different road which was inconsistent with his filing a notice of appeal. Here there is nothing inconsistent about filing a notice within 14 days as opposed to 17 days.\n Thank you, Mr. Marshall.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n We'll hear from Mr. Stewart.\n Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. For four basic reasons the deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable. First, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107 directly implicates the concerns that underlie the special treatment of jurisdictional issues. It's a fundamental precept of our legal system that Federal courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating cases where Congress has not authorized them to do so. Or to put it another way, our legal system has presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the misapplication of law in cases that a court is authorized to adjudicate.\n Mr. Stewart, do you think this is subject   that question is subject matter jurisdiction?\n We would   we would characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction. That is, this Court has often said that it's the fundamental duty of this Court when doubt is   when doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction and that of the court from which the record comes. And that division presupposes that there are cases over which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction, over which this Court would not have appellate jurisdiction. For example, situations sometimes arise, particularly in cases that are adjudicated by three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute as to whether a particular district court order is directly appealable to this Court or should go instead to the court of appeals. And if somebody comes to this Court and this Court determines that the appeal should have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction. This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.\n Mr. Stewart, that's one those interesting examples. We lack jurisdiction of the case but we have power to order it refiled, to vacate the order and have it refiled, don't we?\n That is an anomaly. The Court has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the case except to vacate the order. And I think that's a court that I'm not going to try to explain. (Laughter.)\n But I think Mr. Marshall has identified the second example, namely the final decision requirement of 28 USC 1291. That is, that's universally conceded to be a jurisdictional rule, even though it has nothing to do with whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It is simply whether this particular decision over   for which review is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals. And our point  \n Mr. Stewart, should we repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?\n I don't think you need to   I think you should repudiate any conception that Federal courts have freewheeling authority to excuse noncompliance with statutory time limits for taking appeals.\n Well, the unique circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which courts, say yeah, you can excuse it.\n Well, I   I think actually both Harris and Thompson are explicable on other grounds. And may even be correct in more limited ways. For example, Harris  \n But on the grounds for which they have been taken as authority, is it your view that we should repudiate those grounds?\n Yes. With respect to civil cases for which the time for taking an appeal is specified by statute, it's our view to the extent that Harris and Thompson would otherwise support the proposition that district courts may excuse noncompliance with the time limits, those cases should be repudiated.\n Well   in criminal.\n In criminal cases the time for taking an appeal is not specified by statute. It's imposed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). But there's no statutory basis for it. There was up until 1988 a provision of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 3772, that specifically authorized this Court to promulgate rules that would establish the time for filing a notice of appeal  \n But in   though of course, you'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into the rule. So there is a statute and you read the statute as saying well there could be very some very narrow circumstances that Congress would have been willing to make an exception. For example it is a couple of days and the judge tells you, \"do it\" or lets you do it. It's roughly the same thing, isn't it?\n Well I think it makes a fundamental difference that there is a statute in place. And certainly with respect to circuit certiorari petitions coming from the court of appeals to this Court, this Court has recognized that distinction to be fundamental.\n You're sure habeas cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather than criminal?\n Yes, there's no   no dispute about that. And indeed if the   if this case were classified as civil for purposes of   I mean, as criminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an appeal, it would have been far out of time under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). Indeed the authority of the district court to have granted the reopening period 180 days later wouldn't have been present in the criminal context.\n Looking at the rule, it does require these findings. Has that been interpreted to require that they be written on the record or is that simply something that's supposed to guide the district court?\n I think the courts of appeals have not required that they be written on the record but have required that there be a basis appearing in the record for those findings. So, for instance, if Petitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to reopen in the time, but had not represented that he had not been informed of the judgment, then I think that if the court had granted the reopening, that could be set aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support in the record for such a finding. But I don't believe the courts of appeals have required there be explicit findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the grant of the reopening. The point I was going to make about the certiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1 imposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all cases. It is not divided between civil and criminal. But this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has a very different status is criminal cases than in civil cases. That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out of time, the clerk is directed not to file it. And Rule 13.2 cites USC 21.01(c). So the clear implication is that the Court recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil cases to be a jurisdictional limit. And the crucial point of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word jurisdictionally. It's that it gives an instruction to the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether any other party objects. It's the very type of thing that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction, as to matters over which it has an obligation to take cognizance, regardless of the other party's objection. In criminal cases by contrast the 90-day rule applies under the rules, but the Court has recognized that it retains the authority to grant petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where the other party objects. The other thing I would say about 2107(a) and it's   part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the Government's brief. In the last full paragraph of page 16, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in similar cases is set by 28 U.S.C 2107(a), which states that   and then the part we haven't reproduced says except as otherwise provided in this section. And then it goes on to say no appeal shall bring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30 days. And the significance of this provision, this language, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days. Language like that would conceivably leave open the question of what happens if the notice of appeal is untimely filed. This language actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within 30 days, the appeal will not bring the judgment  \n But it begins with the exception as provided in subparagraph (c).\n That's correct. So we're not saying that the 30-day limit is absolute  \n Yeah.\n   but we're saying that the rule specifies that if the various time restrictions are not complied with, the appeal will not bring   I'm sorry, the appeal shall not bring the judgment, order, or decree before the court of appeals. This is specifically framed as a limitation on the authority of the reviewing court.\n What do you think, if we did go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a fortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a case in which the judge simply said from the bench look, your   your   the new trial motion is timely, though it wasn't; it was out of by two days. While here, we have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered with a   you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you have till the 27th to file.\n Well, are two things we would say about Thompson. The first is that as this Court explained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn, it's long been recognized that a timely motion for reconsideration will suspend the finality of the judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal. And the Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that under certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for reconsideration will have that effect, if the judge appropriately considers it on the merits. And Thompson can be explained as holding simply that where the Government does not object and the district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as timely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend the finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has to read   has to be read to stand for a broader equitable principle. The other thing I'd say about Thompson is that for better or for worse, the Government's brief in opposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the cert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure. Therefore the Court in Thompson was not required to grapple with congressionally imposed limits.\n Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Mancino, you have four minutes remaining.\n If this were a case where someone just missed the 30-day deadline, I don't think we would be talking. We are talking about a case where a judge properly found, properly ruled that notice was not given and had the authority to reopen the case. And we talk about mandatory and jurisdiction of the case. All that were involved in this case is how is the case moved from one court to another. And the   was it moved properly in this case? The unique circumstances, I think you cannot find a more compelling case for unique circumstances. Did the party rely upon the court? Here you have a handwritten notation from the court, signed by the judge  \n Mr. Mancino, does the record tell us how you got notice of that order?\n No, it doesn't. But I mean, I did get notice of it. It came in the mail, but it doesn't  \n You, you got that order in the mail?\n In the mail, correct. And that's why I believe the three days was added, thinking of the mail rule that we have three additional days to do it in connection with the case. And that's how I believe the, how the 17 days came up.\n And I asked this once before: Did the document you received show the dates that it was entered on the docket, so you knew when the 14 days was running from?\n No, the only information it had was the printed   the printed date by the judge. Did not show it was entered that same day.\n Yeah, but in the   in this thing, it says entered on February 10.\n Yeah, that's correct. The docket does show that.\n But how did you find out it had been entered on February 10? Because you did know that at the time you filed your notice of appeal.\n Well, I just went off what the date on the   the handwritten date on the pleading we received from the court. It said February 10, so we just put it in there. Didn't go to the actual docket to see if, in fact, it was entered. As you can see, orders were not   in this case were not entered on date that the judge signified anyway.\n This is, this is all at the top of page 151 of the joint appendix, right? That's the that entire thing.\n That is the   well, it is printed on that. But I mean, if you look at the original document  \n Yes. It was handwritten  \n It's a handwritten   handwritten by the judge in, in the case. So  \n But it says when it was signed by the judge. It doesn't say when it was entered on the docket, when it was entered by the clerk.\n No. It says when the judge signed it. That's correct.\n But it says it in the index, it says   it says docket entries. 2-10, it says entered 2-10, on page 11. On page 11.\n Yeah, that's correct. But that's from the docket  \n Received. So-\n But the document we received from the Court just has   you know   the handwritten notation on it, file your appeal by  \n What would you, what would you have had to have done to find out when it was entered on the docket? Could you have accessed that electronically? Or would you have to go to the court, to  \n Well, probably I could not have   at that time, I mean I could do it now, but at that time you'd have to go over to the courthouse, just like we walked on orders of appeal over to the courthouse, had it stamped by the clerk there, and figured that was the end of it and we were on our way to the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati. Thanks.\n Thank you, Mr. Mancino. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The constitutional error that occurred in Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can result in a conviction of an innocent person. Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of that error or evaluated the effect of that error under the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard. Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple. In the California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional trial error that occurred in this case. Had that court complied with this Court's precedent, that court would have first identified the constitutional error that occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the effect of that error under the Chapman test. The failure of that court to do so, the unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings. It scarcely seems reasonable  \n I suppose he could have come here on direct.\n He could have, Your Honor, however, he didn't have the right to counsel to come following his appeal to the State appellate court, and then after the denial of his petition, it would be a discretionary review in the California Supreme Court, he no longer had the right to counsel. And the fact of the matter is if he had filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that, it would have effectively been asking at that stage for a type of error correction. It scarcely seems logical that the scope of the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the constitutional violation that he suffered, that that should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable decision-making of the State appellate court in the  \n Well, if we're talking about what   where is the logic in the result that I believe you're position produces, which is that a prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless, obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him. Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on   or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. Now, you know, why would there   what does he care whether   whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation? Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?\n Justice Scalia, that's the point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief here. And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit truncated, by the State appellate court. But it was not a Chapman analysis. And that failure of the State appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is contrary to this Court's precedent. It ignores Chapman, it also would be an attack on  \n Let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines   erroneously   that there was no constitutional violation at all. Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation. Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?\n I don't know that necessarily there has to be one standard of review for the other   for one or the other, Your Honor. Our position in this case is simply following the logic of this Court's decision in Mitchell versus Esparza, that this Court or any Federal habeas court needs to consider what the State appellate court did. You cannot divorce   there is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial. Then that error is compounded when a State appellate court fails to assess the effect of that error under the Chapman standard.\n You could say the same thing when the State court has erroneously determined that there was no violation. In that case, you apply the Kotteakos standard. I just don't understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error.\n Well  \n I thought the State court didn't find that there was error. I thought the State court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it in.\n That's correct.\n It wasn't until we got into the Federal court that there was an error found. As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman or not, because there was no error.\n That's correct. That's in pages 94 to 97 of the joint appendix. The State appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter of State law in this case. The court also concluded that there was no constitutional error. Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97 of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case. However, in making that alternative holding, the State appellate court, the California court, was applying what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent of the Kotteakos type standard.\n And it is that determination that you are objecting to here. The harmlessness determination.\n I am, Your Honor. Obviously, we are objecting to the State court's finding of no underlying substantive constitutional violation, as well as the State court's determination that there was no  \n But for the former, you are perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos. And for the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman. I just don't see the logic of that.\n Well, first of all, this case, since it has now been determined in the Federal courts that there was an underlying constitutional violation, does not present that question. We do   and I understand the position that you are raising, Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the logic there. I don't think the Court has to resolve that here. Some of the lower Federal courts have determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht standard has been completely supplanted. Some courts have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus is Esparza to lead to that conclusion. And that may very well be the case. However, I don't think the Court needs to ultimately address that proposition in this case.\n As I read the Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review. You would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that it's collateral review rather than direct.\n Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, collateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht, can result in a more deferential standard of harmless error inquiry. The   those considerations that led this Court in Brecht to adopt Kotteakos rather than Chapman apply across-the-board in all habeas cases. However, a central theme of the Brecht decision was that there have been Chapman analysis conducted by the State appellate judiciary  \n Well, I guess that's where maybe we   is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard. I'm not sure I agree with you that the latter is the case.\n I agree that it could be   it is a debatable point. But the   to ignore the circumstance that this Court stressed, I think undoubtedly stressed in Brecht that there had been that State appellate review is to basically divorce the holding in Brecht from the factual context in which that case   or out of which that case arose.\n The dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in Brecht. They said that Kotteakos would apply even where the State court has found that \"no violation has occurred.\"\n That's true, Justice Scalia.\n In other words, never approached the harmlessness thing. That's what the dissenters thought.\n The dissenters thought that the import of Brecht was that it was going to apply across-the-board in Federal habeas  \n And I don't think the majority said the contrary. I mean, I wrote it. I mean, I don't know   what counts is what I wrote, not what I thought. But if you read it, I don't think it decides this question. What I wonder, though, is why does the   how does this case present the issue you want to argue? I'm   Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that. As I understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right. And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing. There could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person. That means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals court finds no error. Now, we get over to the Federal court. And they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End of case. Now, where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and   I mean, when I   it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so complicated. How does this case raise it?\n Well, I suppose, Your Honor, because of the fact that the State appellate court didn't simply state, we find no error, and leave it at that, but rather, the State appellate court also raised the point that, in a footnote, in a truncated manner, that there is no possible  \n Was that as a reason for there not being error? Or was it in the context of saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no possible prejudice. What does the footnote mean, in your opinion? The second?\n Yes.\n What is the footnote number?\n It's footnote 17.\n Okay. I'll read it.\n Page what?\n It's 97 in the Joint Appendix, Your Honor.\n Thank you.\n Thank you. Very helpful. The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression on me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a different context, it's the same problem. He said, I originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could conscientiously say, although I consider the findings clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes from an agency. But when I think about it, I don't think there's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that this is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll reverse. I mean, I find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing is possible.\n I agree with you, Your Honor. It's angels on the pin of a needle, I guess is the phrase here, and this case may be a case where the difference between Chapman and Brecht could be of consequence. If you'd look at the district court's treatment of this case, at the district court level the court stated: \"Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating actionable error,\" and that court is applying the Brecht standard. The district court states: \"I cannot rule out prejudice in this case.\" So seemingly had that court applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in the district court. Likewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice even under the Brecht standard, and then we have the panel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the prejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples' testimony been admitted that would have substantially bolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence. That statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is harmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying the Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in Mr. Fry's  \n If I could come back to, may I ask this question: Is part of your argument that even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n This is a case, am I correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then a five-week deliberation in this case? And there was a harmless   and the testimony of Maples was she had seen a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?\n Correct, Your Honor.\n Where is that in the question presented?\n It says that if the Brecht standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear the burden? I guess that's the narrower question, who has the burden.\n Well, the Respondent has essentially conceded that under O'Neal that they bear the risk of non-persuasion.\n But O'Neal, I thought O'Neal just says that this word \"burden of proof\" is out of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading the record.\n I think that that was what the holding in the majority opinion was, but I think, as Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion, the effect of that is to allocate the risk of non-persuasion to the State. And so I think that that's   I could be wrong, but it seems to me a semantic point. And to Justice Stevens' question, as you pointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard which this court adopted in Brecht is an exacting standard. And in applying that standard, if you'd look at this case, the Court's decisions, Sullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the jury. Here we have a jury in the third trial that deliberated for 23 court days after 29 court days  \n You're now arguing that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is that the point you're making?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Okay. Now, I didn't hear the answer to my question. I'm not sure that is in the question that you presented and on which we granted cert. It says which standard applies, who bears the burden. I don't see anything saying is this   was it erroneous to conclude that this was harmless under Brecht.\n Well, I believe, number one, does it matter which standard applies as part of the question presented? Does it matter which harmless error standard is implied? My answer to that is no, because Mr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman. And this Court could in this case simply decide this case on that very narrow question, like many court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply, Brecht or Chapman, when there has been no Chapman analysis in the State court or when there has been an objectively unreasonable Chapman analysis in the State court. Most courts confronted with that issue say, we don't need to decide the question here because either the error was plainly harmless under both of those standards or plainly not harmless under both of these standards. And I simply recounted the history of the litigation below in the Federal courts to point out that this could be a case where that make a difference. It seems like  \n The trouble with reading that second question that way is that, you know, it follows from your first question, which speaks in the generality of cases. It's not speaking to this case. Your first question presented is, if constitutional error in a State trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman or in Brecht? That's the first question. Very generalized. Second question: Does it matter which harmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I thought it meant, you know, is there any difference between the two standards? Don't you think that's fair reading of it.\n No, Your Honor.\n You think it means, does it matter in this case which harmless   you think that second sentence means would, would the defendant be entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which harmless error standard is employed? You think that's what it means?\n I think that that is the import of that portion of the question.\n Is that a question on which we would be likely to grant cert?\n Perhaps not if that was the only question in and of itself, but perhaps so because, as I indicated before, as Justice Stevens stressed in his concurring opinion in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard is a demanding standard. And look at this case. If the error in this case can be deemed harmless under any standard, then what cannot? What is prejudice when you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury where nine days into the deliberations at least five of them voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty. They told the judge that they were at an impasse. This jury struggled mightily with this evidence.\n Would you help me with one thing I'm not terribly clear about, though. Is it clear which   what side the magistrate thought had the burden of persuasion?\n It is not, and it seems as though, looking at the language that the magistrate judge utilized in his findings and recommendations, that he was looking to me, to Mr. Fry, to meet that burden. And I quoted his language in my brief and to the Ninth Circuit and I argued to the Ninth Circuit that the burden of persuasion had been improperly allocated to Mr. Fry. However, that issue was simply not addressed in the Ninth Circuit's opinion.\n Does your opponent now concede that the State has the burden?\n Yes, Respondent concedes that their burden   that it's their burden  \n How do they say that after I thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the Court which said this concept is not applicable in   when you're reviewing a record for harmless error. It's not a question of presenting evidence. What I think it said is that it's not a question of presentation of evidence. In such a case, we think it's conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judge's   the jury's decision? Now, maybe I was wrong, but I think there was a majority of the Court that agreed with it.\n Yes, Your Honor. And I think your point, as I understood it, in O'Neal was that it analytically does not make sense  \n To talk about burdens of proof?\n   when the appellate court is  \n Yes. But that's my basic question in this case and it's a serious question. Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, and if I really try I can bring myself to understand this question. Regardless of what I think, could another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have thought the opposite? I can do that mentally. You try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm sorry. I admit it. Now, if that's the state of mind that I can get myself into   and I believe that's true of many judges   how do I write words that are realistic in this area?\n I think that that's a question, Your Honor, that this court has struggled with. As Justice Scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in Dominguez Benitez, that we're talking about with these harmless error standards ineffable gradations of probability that are beyond even the judicial mind to grasp. But I think if we just tie it to the facts of this case, I think that in the explanation you just gave that there is no reasonable judge who could look at this case and conclude  \n There are many situations in which an appellate court has to apply a legal standard to facts in criminal cases and civil cases. In a criminal case, an issue on appeal could be whether there's sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Do you think there's a burden of persuasion on appeal on all of those issues?\n With respect to a standard sufficiency analysis, no, Justice Alito. It's just a question for the appellate judge to discern, was there sufficient evidence in the record reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\n What's the difference between that and applying any harmless error standard? It's exactly the same kind of analysis. It's a different legal test, but you're applying, you're applying the law to facts.\n I agree. And I don't quarrel at all with the way that the court described   said that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless error inquiry in the O'Neal case, that it doesn't fit to look at it in terms of the allocation of burden. I don't think that this case ultimately turns on that, except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted by the district court judge did state that he was looking to Mr. Fry to make the sufficient showing  \n Are you talking about what's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix? That was the only place that I found where the magistrate expressed a view on this. It reads: \"The court does not find that there has been\"   \"the court does find that there has been an insufficient showing. So that \"insufficient showing\" means showing by the Petitioner.\" Is that what you're relying on?\n Yes. That's exactly what I'm relying on, Your Honor. So, going back to specifically the facts of this case, this Court could, as I indicated earlier, without regard to the thorny Chapman versus Brecht question, decide this case solely in terms of, under Brecht, does Mr. Fry prevail; and we look at the nature of the constitutional violation that occurred.\n That wouldn't help us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which standard is applicable, though, right?\n No, it certainly would not, Your Honor. And this Court may very well deem that to be necessary. But I think also that this Court fashioning a decision which is faithful to the requirement that   or the principle that Kotteakos is an exacting standard, would also be an important constitutional principle. In a case like this, where there has been no Chapman review and where the Chapman court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error standard in order to safeguard convictions, safeguard against erroneous convictions where there is a close question of guilt or innocence, that hasn't happened in this case and it would be appropriate for this Court to fashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure that that happens.\n And that would put 2254 out of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a Federal conviction then it's always Brecht on post-conviction relief?\n As I understand that question, the Solicitor General pointed out in the introduction of its amicus brief that there are some 2255 cases where there's been an intervening change in the law which could involve this question of Brecht versus Chapman. And I've cited in my brief a district court case, United States versus Monsanto, where the court concluded, in accordance with the position that I'm advocating, that it makes no sense for a reviewing court in a habeas proceeding to apply the Brecht standard blindly without regard to what was done in prior proceedings, but rather there's no need for deference, where the   the big issue in Brecht, as I understand it, was this Court was concerned about simply repeating a harmless error analysis that the State court had already done; and we're not asking this Court to do that in this case. The same concern, Justice Ginsburg, holds over in certain limited 2255 cases. If I may save the balance of my time.\n Thank you, Mr. Haltom. Mr. Moody.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal habeas is limited in scope and purpose. It is not a continuation of the appellate process. Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State sovereignty. In Brecht, this court held that the stringent Chapman standard was inappropriate for use on collateral review. Instead, in order to strike a proper balance between State and Federal interests, the actual prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect on the verdict should be used in collateral cases. Petitioner is asking for an exception to this rule. He claims that if he did not receive Chapman review in State court, he should receive it on Federal habeas. That was not the rule in Brecht and it should not be adopted by this Court here. The Brecht decision did not state an exception based on the State standard used. The key in Brecht was that appropriate balance between the Federal Government and the State. This Court has never treated cases where there was not a state Chapman finding differently from other cases. It applies Brecht throughout. In the Penry case and in the O'Neal case there was no Chapman finding in state court, yet this Court applied Brecht and made no comment about that.\n You said in your brief that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should have sought cert   direct review from the State court's conviction. Did you say that?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n But realistically, the likelihood that such a petition would be successful, passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would grant cert on such a question is very slim.\n I agree, the likelihood of the cert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not change the fact that once you come to court under 2254, you are asking for collateral review. And in collateral review, it's inappropriate to apply the Chapman standard.\n I suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under 2254, that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible?\n I, I agree with that, Your Honor.\n Counsel, if the State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously, how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas? You would ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?\n Yes, Your Honor. First you would ask if it was an unreasonable application of Chapman. If you found that it was not, then the case is over, there's no need to grant the writ. If you found that it was, you would proceed and do a Brecht analysis. And that's what we learned from  \n That seems awfully refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses? Is this an   is this an unreasonable application of Chapman? And then apply the Brecht standard after determining that it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?\n I don't disagree. I'm merely trying to make sense of the various decisions in this, in this arena. There's some tension between the Esparza decision and other decisions of the Court; and one has to find a place for AEDPA standard. So we would not object to simply an application of Brecht which is what this Court has always done. But as far as it seems to suggest there may be an interim step.\n Suppose we apply Brecht. This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG in the briefs. He states them very well. The first is let's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded. Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of   an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence. So that's their finding on the merits. Then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. How could both those things be true? How could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? That's one thing they say. But the exclusion was harmless. I just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.\n I think that the explanation is as follows. When you're analyzing the denial of a defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first look to see how it fit into the defense. And that is what they were doing. You're not looking at the entire case. You're looking only at the defense. And so in the sense that something is better than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven may improve the defense case. And yet nonetheless, when you move to the next question, which is, was there a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking at everything that was available to the jury   it may be that there was still so much other evidence that it could overcome whatever increase you received on the defense.\n Why is it necessary for us to try to reconcile those two statements? The Ninth Circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for purposes of the question that's presented to us. So why shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question independently of what they said about whether there was a Chambers violation?\n We would not object to that. I'm trying to   I'm trying to assist Justice Breyer in that perceived imbalance between a finding of a substance above and then a finding of harmless error before.\n Well, every time evidence is excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the equivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's not a constitutional error under Chambers and related cases, is there?\n Yes. We agree. That's certainly the law of this Court. And in this, in   well, let me move on. I'd like to make a couple of other points.\n May I go just back to Justice Breyer's question for a second?\n Sure.\n And I mean, I think your answer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as sort of a general statement. But in   would you agree that in this case, if we   if we do proceed, number one, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and we then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine whether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this particular case, the, the record indicates that the case was so close that there would have to be a finding of harmful error, or at least it would be impossible to find harmless error. Even applying Brecht clear. And you know what I'm getting at. I mean, five weeks of deliberation. The question after, whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on. Obviously this   this case was just to tottering on the edge. So even if we, if we do get to the point of applying Brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that he's   he gets no relief under Brecht?\n No, I would disagree with that. You've the sixth court to hear this case. The prior five have all rejected his claim. And while  \n But two or three of those did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now, don't you?\n No, I don't agree with that.\n For purposes of argument.\n For purposes of argument I do. The district court and the Ninth Circuit both applied Brecht and found that this was not an error which  \n It was two to one in the Ninth Circuit.\n This is true.\n Judge Rawlinson I think said that using the Brecht standard, that there was actual prejudice.\n Yes, she did. There was a dissent in the Ninth Circuit.\n Isn't this the   I may have it wrong   but isn't this the case in which the witness was unique not cumulative because she was the only one who was completely disinterested.\n No. I would disagree with that. She's been characterized that way. But, and I want to point out that, I would like to clarify the record in response to your question, Justice Stevens. You asked whether or not she saw another man commit the murder. And counsel appeared to agree with you. That was not her testimony. Her testimony was that she overheard someone else confessing to murders that may or may not have been these murders. And the   and this was a very long case. This case lasted eleven weeks, it involved a hundred witnesses. You can look at the opinions it produced in state court and in the district court. They're each 100 pages long. It's not unreasonable to expect the jury to take a long time to decide that case. Now there are 25 court days of deliberations  \n Five, five weeks?\n Five weeks, 25 court days, 24 of which were taken up with read back. Several   several holidays. I mean if you want to go through and look at it, now  \n Do you know of any other case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?\n I haven't attempted to find one. It is a long deliberation.\n I'm sure there's an example somewhere, but I   I practiced law for over 40 years, and I never heard of it.\n At what point, how many weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?\n I believe that was   I keep, I've been switching back and forth between calendar days and court days. So forgive me. I believe that was on the eighth court day. And at that point, when they announced they were hung, they selected a new foreperson and then rolled up their sleeves and went back in and deliberated the case.\n So  \n And after  \n Go ahead.\n After they selected the new foreperson, they asked for 15 read backs, including the crucial evidence in the case. The ballistics experts. They asked for that. They asked for the testimony of the in-custody witness who heard the confession of Mr. Fry. They asked for Mr. Fry's testimony.\n Did they ask for a read back of Mrs. Maples' testimony?\n Well, Mrs. Maples' testimony was not admitted. It was excluded.\n Oh, that's right. Of course.\n But they did not   significantly they did not ask for read back of the witnesses who testified similarly to, to Ms. Maples. The third party culpability case was basically not credited by the jury. They did not a read back of those witnesses.\n Well, maybe, maybe you'd end up  \n Well, maybe a critical witness was left out. That argues the other way, I think.\n I would encourage the Court to carefully look at what Ms. Maples was going to say. If you look in her own words, and I'm quoting: I was just in and out of the room. I just listened to bits and pieces of it. And that's at joint appendix 10. This, this witness may have been Mr. Hurtz's cousin, and not his ex-girlfriend, or his ex-girlfriend's mother, but she did not have very much to say about this. She said she didn't hear the beginning of the statement. She could not tell you whether it was a serious discussion. She was in and out of the room. She heard only bits and pieces.\n But what she heard was that they were going to kill, this other person was going to kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was the crime at issue.\n With respect, that's not what she heard.\n What did she hear?\n What she heard was a statement that he had killed a man and a woman. And this was not immediately after the offense. This is 18 months after the offense, this is not next day.\n Do you think   do you think, do you think I should do this? I'm still looking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are, having this Court announce too many six-part tests, and having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a mistake for a judge and then you never finish a proceeding. I'm worried about that, as are you.\n Yes.\n At the same time, I think what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge. Not what   quite what the test says. So there has to be a conscientious effort to decide, was there   was it harmless? Could a reasonable jurist in California have concluded the opposite? Okay. So maybe we should do it in this case. We simply try ourselves to go through this record, make that determination to show by example, rather than by trying to find a form of words.\n Well, you don't do it very often. I understand that that's something you could do if you wanted to. I think that this is just a classic case where two courts applied the Brecht standard and reached their conclusions and there's nothing really remarkable about it.\n The third party perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or Hearst?\n Hurtz. Yes.\n And there   there was a link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship between Hurtz and the victim?\n That's right.\n Was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through Maples?\n Actually, I'm thinking about my answer because I was thinking about Borelli. There were three third party culpability, potential targets in this case. And I believe that Hurtz, the testimony of several of the witness who were admitted did testify of a link between Cindy Bell and Hurtz.\n Otherwise, I mean, they couldn't have found it was cumulative if   if that had not been the case.\n In order to   I need to correct the record on that as well. The trial judge did not find that this was cumulative. He found a lack of foundation. What happened was, was Ms. Maples was offered as a witness  \n But   on appellate review in California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?\n The alternative prejudice holding, the footnote 17, they said it would have been cumulative.\n Right. Okay.\n Yes.\n And they   they couldn't have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on Hurtz, apart from Maples?\n Oh, that's right. Yes. There was, and that's really my point. My point is that 11 third party culpability witnesses were allowed to testify in this trial. And one was excluded.\n How did Hurtz's name enter into the trial?\n Well  \n Why did anybody mention him?\n Well, for one thing, he was called to testify and asked if he killed these people. Mr. Hurtz testified at this trial. The jury got to see him, they got to look him in the eye, they got to hear him on direct, they got to hear him on cross. And they did not ask for a read back of that testimony.\n And if Maples' testimony had come in, I presume they could have cross-examined him on the basis of Maples' testimony?\n Well, he stated he never said he killed these people. And he, he stated he'd never said he killed a man and a woman in a car. So it   it went to what Maples would have said, and also  \n Did he say he'd killed peoples otherwise, or at other times? (Laughter.)\n He also denied doing that.\n Well, but then at that point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction   Maples' testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation, becomes more relevant.\n I would disagree, simply because she says she didn't hear the conversation well enough to really give her testimony any true probative value in the case because she was in and out of the room. She didn't hear the beginning. She didn't hear the end. And when she's asked, was it a serious discussion, she says, I don't know. So this could be   this could be something very different  \n That's classic going to the weight of the evidence. That goes to the weight, not the admissibility.\n Ordinarily I would agree with that. And if we knew, Your Honor, that he was speaking about these killings, then certainly it would go to the weight. But since he was speaking about killings that she said she didn't know if they were in California, New Jersey, she didn't know when they occurred, and therefore   in California we ask that before you present third party culpability evidence you tie it to this crime.\n So we don't assume that he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?\n Well, it's   he may have committed other killings, but if did not confess to committing these killings then there's no probative value to her testimony.\n Do you think the question of the application of Brecht is included within the questions presented?\n No. I briefed it because I was concerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't think it is fairly presented. The only other point that I wanted to make is that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will basically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a near wholesale application of Chapman on collateral review. As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many times Petitioners come to court and they have a case where there was no finding of constitutional error in State court and therefore no Chapman application, but they're going to assert that in Federal court. And so if in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then you really have reduced application of Brecht.\n But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.\n I don't think we should assume that the State courts are going to do that. I think that what   it's sort of like what we said earlier in the argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary ruling is a constitutional violation. I would say most of them are not. And this Court has not drawn a bright line of exactly where that is. So in many cases, this is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best. And so, therefore, the State court would not be going to a Chapman standard because it would not be finding error. And with that, I'm prepared to submit.\n Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett?\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The distinction between collateral review and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review for harmlessness in collateral review become the same standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it. That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this Court. He got Chapman review. They cited Chapman. They didn't cite it here. That's the only difference. Mr. Brecht came to this Court and said they unreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it again on habeas, and this Court said that there is a deep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral review and direct review and that distinction turns upon the fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a long record where difficult calls were made. It is to correct fundamental miscarriages of justice, grievous wrongs that have caused custody in violation of constitutional  \n May I ask two questions and then you can proceed. One, do you take a position on who has the burden of persuasion? That's the first question. And do you have an opinion on proper application of Brecht in this case?\n If I can adopt Justice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this Court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of burden of persuasion. We accept O'Neal's holding what then there is equipoise, which did not what happened in this case, the tie goes to  \n But you do agree if it were in equipoise the State would have the burden?\n The tie would go to the prisoner, yes. Were it in equipoise, because the State would have the burden the State would lose. I don't think that's what happened in this case. I think what Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court and what the judge will say in, what the court said in O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially contributed to the jury's verdict? And that is essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very bottom when it said \"The court doesn't find that there's an insufficient showing\"   that's the same way of saying I haven't been persuaded   that the error contributed to the verdict. So I don't think that this case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it the burden of persuasion or the proper level of conviction on the part of the court. This court was not persuaded and that is all that matters. When the court is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner loses. The second question you asked was whether we have a position on application of Brecht, and we do. We've laid it out in our brief. We think that in no sense does this record support the notion, support the argument, that there was a substantial and injurious effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was excluded, talking about third party culpability. And that requires not just looking at what, in isolation, what evidence was in there about Mr. Hurtz. There was I think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him either say he did it or he was there or he was involved. But it requires looking at the whole record. And there were   the defense here was not a Hurtz versus Fry. This was a case where the defense did an excellent job. It was a well defended case, and threw up a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it bought on. In the third trial you had what you didn't had in the prior trials. You had ballistics evidence that linked his gun to the crime. You have his own admission, his own testimony, that he left the house that night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out in the truck that was seen at   a truck of the same type, that was seen at the crime scene.\n I have the same problem Justice Souter does, in all candor. The jury takes five weeks to decide the case and there's a fairly interesting bit of testimony that doesn't get in. And to say to be totally satisfied it didn't have an injurious effect on the deliberations is a close question, I think.\n Well, two answers. If it's a close question, if AEDPA and if Kotteakos and Brecht mean anything, it's that the close calls go to the State and are not overturned by the sixth court on review.\n No, but an equally divided call goes the other way.\n I'm sorry?\n If it's not just a close call, but if it's equal, it goes the other way.\n It is, and no one has thought this was equal. The two courts   the three courts, the California Court of Appeals also said in any event there's no possible prejudice. Now, how they could say no possible prejudice under a State standard and still say, ah, but it would have affected the verdict under Chapman, is not something I'm able to understand. So I think you have  \n Neither am I. But I draw a different conclusion from it from the one you're drawing.\n I guess I misunderstand your point, because I think when the court said there's no possible prejudice  \n I mean, I cannot accept the State   the conclusion that there was no possible prejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment ago and I a moment before sort of put out. I just do not find that a reasonable conclusion.\n Well, again, even if the Court thinks there may have been some chance, may have been   you know   relevant testimony   this Court can well disagree and can conclude that this was abuse of discretion. If it were Federal Rule of Evidence 403, you could decide this was a an abuse of discretion. Whether it was unconstitutional, so clearly unconstitutional as to merit under AEDPA and under Brecht reversal of the conviction 12 years after the fact  \n I thought the AEDPA question was out of it because that hasn't been   there was no cross-appeal on that question. I thought it was a given, a given in this case, that the California courts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law. I didn't think that was an issue in the case. I think we took it on the assumption that it was such an error.\n Again, the Respondents in this case have not conceded constitutional error, and in their brief they repeat that. And I think there's a question whether a court should  \n It's not raised here. There was no cross-appeal from that.\n Well, a Respondent is entitled to defend on any ground supported by the record. But even assuming that, we'll assume the error, assumes that there was an error and one assumes that it was   which is hard for me to get to, but one assumes it was clearly unconstitutional in this close call, the type of call that's made hundreds of times in every trial, balancing this, and the combination of lack of foundation and cumulativeness. It's hard for me to understand when that rises to the level of unconstitutionality. But if we assume that it did, you have the two courts that applied the Brecht standard here. And the district court decision here is nearly 100 pages long. It's a very careful, methodical analysis.\n That's because there were many, many issues raised.\n There's many issues, but also it was being careful and it was being very methodical. And it went through this and it went through this record. That court went through true this record, more than 5,000 transcript pages, 11 week of trial, more than 100 witnesses. And it was on that  \n I suppose if we're going to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would have to do the same thing.\n I think that's what this Court has said. The other thing I want to get back to is the question about the length of jury deliberations. Sure, this was really wrong. Now, they changed forepersons in midstream and got a reasonable doubt instruction repeated. Who knows what happened. But what I will not concede   I will concede it's long, but I will not concede that the mere fact of length of deliberations says anything about if this one particular error in applying a balancing test substantially affected the verdict. I think the length of deliberations is so incredibly speculative.\n You will concede it was a close case, won't you?\n I will concede it was, I will concede it was a difficult case.\n If you take five weeks it's pretty clearly a close case.\n That's right. But you know, the whole the point of federal habeas corpus is that this is not filling in the gaps in direct review. We're not going to give you  \n There's no evidence or inference that it was close on the alternative murderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples' testimony goes to.\n That's exactly right. In fact, if you look at the closing arguments, Mr. Hurtz has a couple of references in a two-day closing argument. That was not the centerpiece of his case.\n It has to be close on an alternative murderer. It wasn't suicide. Obviously, if he didn't do it, somebody else did. So if it's a close case from the first, it's obviously a close case for the second.\n No, but as to who did it and whether Hurtz did it or whether   remember, what the defense is trying to show is not who did it; it's that this person didn't do it, and whether it was them or someone else is what we don't know. Again, this is Federal habeas corpus before this Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court has in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were involved, was so   that simply disallowed the twelfth out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the verdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years after the crime. And yes, the jury   it was close in the sense that they worked a long hard time. But at the end of the day, they were unanimous. There's nothing close about unanimous. And I think it would be the wrong message to say that a jury that works as hard as this one did, did the readbacks, culled through this record  \n Yes, but we don't know what they would have done if they had this evidence that was excluded. That's the problem.\n One never knows that in habeas corpus. But what you do when you look at what they were focusing on, they were focusing on the two ballistics experts. They had them read back right next each other. They made that call. It's their job to do it.\n But the reason they may have been doing that is that they may very well have thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to know was whether the evidence going specifically to this defendant was strong enough to overcome it.\n May I answer? One would have expected at least one readback on third party culpability instead of three readbacks of Mr. Fry's testimony which put himself that night with the gun in the truck, and which he said   you know   and beforehand he agreed he might have said he wanted to blow them away. Thank you.\n Thank you, counsel. Mr. Haltom, you have three minutes remaining.\n Thank you. The trial counsel  \n Mr. Haltom, before you go drifting, counsel, into the evidentiary questions in the case, I have one question. Two cases. A, Hurtz did not testify at all. B, he did. Is the foundation ruling any different in the two cases insofar as Maples' testimony or is it the same? I.e., is there a lesser showing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?\n I think that possibly the foundation with Hurtz there could be increased. The jury sought Mr. Hurtz.\n Oh, you mean, oh, you mean more? You have to be more strict for foundation after Hurtz testified? I was suggesting the opposite.\n Well, I was just thinking that his presence there would be relevant. The jury actually saw him. They heard a truck driver describing, a neutral truck driver, describing the actual killer, who in no way fit the description of Mr. Fry. Unfortunately, the record doesn't indicate what Mr. Hurtz looked like, but the jury saw it. And if the jury saw that that truck driver was describing a man that looked like Mr. Hurtz, then that  \n But there were all kinds of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony, including the time, the timing of the murder.\n There were infirmities in his testimony, Your Honor. However, he came from Missouri, so maybe he was looking at a Missouri clock. We don't know. But why would that man make up a story? He has no axe to grind in this case. And then his testimony is corroborated by a gentleman who sees him immediately after it and says: He looked like he had just seen a ghost, and described seeing a double execution-style murder. Now  \n That was all presented to the jury, right?\n That was all presented to the jury. However, Ms. Maples' testimony was not, and counsel did not argue that heavily focused on Mr. Hurtz' guilt. She certainly did argue it, but the reason that she didn't is because, as the Court of Appeals, the California Court of Appeals, said, the other seven witnesses who said Mr. Hurtz said he had killed the Bells were all described as having been flimsy witness who gave contradictory unbelievable testimony.\n Well, how strong is this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and didn't   couldn't tell whether he was talking about something that happened 10 years before or 2 days before?\n Mr. Chief Justice, she was extremely strong. Page JA-78 in the joint appendix, Respondent concedes she was the only unbiased witness concerning Mr. Hurtz's   concerning Mr. Hurtz. She heard this, her cousin, saying he shot a man and a woman in a parked car, first shooting the woman in the head, then shooting the man, getting blood all over himself. That linked up with all the other confessions in this case. Interlinking confessions just like in Chambers were deemed to provide adequate assurance of reliability.\n Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.\n We'll hear argument this morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler. Mr. Haltom.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The constitutional error that occurred in Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can result in a conviction of an innocent person. Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of that error or evaluated the effect of that error under the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard. Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple. In the California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional trial error that occurred in this case. Had that court complied with this Court's precedent, that court would have first identified the constitutional error that occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the effect of that error under the Chapman test. The failure of that court to do so, the unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings. It scarcely seems reasonable  \n I suppose he could have come here on direct.\n He could have, Your Honor, however, he didn't have the right to counsel to come following his appeal to the State appellate court, and then after the denial of his petition, it would be a discretionary review in the California Supreme Court, he no longer had the right to counsel. And the fact of the matter is if he had filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that, it would have effectively been asking at that stage for a type of error correction. It scarcely seems logical that the scope of the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the constitutional violation that he suffered, that that should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable decision-making of the State appellate court in the  \n Well, if we're talking about what   where is the logic in the result that I believe you're position produces, which is that a prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless, obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him. Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on   or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. Now, you know, why would there   what does he care whether   whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation? Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?\n Justice Scalia, that's the point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief here. And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit truncated, by the State appellate court. But it was not a Chapman analysis. And that failure of the State appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is contrary to this Court's precedent. It ignores Chapman, it also would be an attack on  \n Let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines   erroneously   that there was no constitutional violation at all. Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation. Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?\n I don't know that necessarily there has to be one standard of review for the other   for one or the other, Your Honor. Our position in this case is simply following the logic of this Court's decision in Mitchell versus Esparza, that this Court or any Federal habeas court needs to consider what the State appellate court did. You cannot divorce   there is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial. Then that error is compounded when a State appellate court fails to assess the effect of that error under the Chapman standard.\n You could say the same thing when the State court has erroneously determined that there was no violation. In that case, you apply the Kotteakos standard. I just don't understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error.\n Well  \n I thought the State court didn't find that there was error. I thought the State court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it in.\n That's correct.\n It wasn't until we got into the Federal court that there was an error found. As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman or not, because there was no error.\n That's correct. That's in pages 94 to 97 of the joint appendix. The State appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter of State law in this case. The court also concluded that there was no constitutional error. Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97 of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case. However, in making that alternative holding, the State appellate court, the California court, was applying what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent of the Kotteakos type standard.\n And it is that determination that you are objecting to here. The harmlessness determination.\n I am, Your Honor. Obviously, we are objecting to the State court's finding of no underlying substantive constitutional violation, as well as the State court's determination that there was no  \n But for the former, you are perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos. And for the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman. I just don't see the logic of that.\n Well, first of all, this case, since it has now been determined in the Federal courts that there was an underlying constitutional violation, does not present that question. We do   and I understand the position that you are raising, Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the logic there. I don't think the Court has to resolve that here. Some of the lower Federal courts have determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht standard has been completely supplanted. Some courts have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus is Esparza to lead to that conclusion. And that may very well be the case. However, I don't think the Court needs to ultimately address that proposition in this case.\n As I read the Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on harmlessness is based on the structural consideration that your under collateral review at that point, rather than under direct review. You would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that it's collateral review rather than direct.\n Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, collateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht, can result in a more deferential standard of harmless error inquiry. The   those considerations that led this Court in Brecht to adopt Kotteakos rather than Chapman apply across-the-board in all habeas cases. However, a central theme of the Brecht decision was that there have been Chapman analysis conducted by the State appellate judiciary  \n Well, I guess that's where maybe we   is the subject of debate, whether the central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, and that calls for a different standard, or whether the central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, and therefore, that calls for a different standard. I'm not sure I agree with you that the latter is the case.\n I agree that it could be   it is a debatable point. But the   to ignore the circumstance that this Court stressed, I think undoubtedly stressed in Brecht that there had been that State appellate review is to basically divorce the holding in Brecht from the factual context in which that case   or out of which that case arose.\n The dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in Brecht. They said that Kotteakos would apply even where the State court has found that \"no violation has occurred.\"\n That's true, Justice Scalia.\n In other words, never approached the harmlessness thing. That's what the dissenters thought.\n The dissenters thought that the import of Brecht was that it was going to apply across-the-board in Federal habeas  \n And I don't think the majority said the contrary. I mean, I wrote it. I mean, I don't know   what counts is what I wrote, not what I thought. But if you read it, I don't think it decides this question. What I wonder, though, is why does the   how does this case present the issue you want to argue? I'm   Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that. As I understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to let this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right. And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a mistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that this witness added nothing. There could no possible prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that person. That means it was cumulative, that means it did nothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals court finds no error. Now, we get over to the Federal court. And they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the point where the constitution is violated unless they disagreed with that decision of making no possible difference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End of case. Now, where does it raise all this stuff about harmless error and   I mean, when I   it is hard for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so complicated. How does this case raise it?\n Well, I suppose, Your Honor, because of the fact that the State appellate court didn't simply state, we find no error, and leave it at that, but rather, the State appellate court also raised the point that, in a footnote, in a truncated manner, that there is no possible  \n Was that as a reason for there not being error? Or was it in the context of saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no possible prejudice. What does the footnote mean, in your opinion? The second?\n Yes.\n What is the footnote number?\n It's footnote 17.\n Okay. I'll read it.\n Page what?\n It's 97 in the Joint Appendix, Your Honor.\n Thank you.\n Thank you. Very helpful. The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression on me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a different context, it's the same problem. He said, I originally thought this was the case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could conscientiously say, although I consider the findings clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial evidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes from an agency. But when I think about it, I don't think there's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other words, has there ever been a case in the history of mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that this is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll reverse. I mean, I find it very difficult to get myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing is possible.\n I agree with you, Your Honor. It's angels on the pin of a needle, I guess is the phrase here, and this case may be a case where the difference between Chapman and Brecht could be of consequence. If you'd look at the district court's treatment of this case, at the district court level the court stated: \"Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating actionable error,\" and that court is applying the Brecht standard. The district court states: \"I cannot rule out prejudice in this case.\" So seemingly had that court applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in the district court. Likewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice even under the Brecht standard, and then we have the panel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the prejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples' testimony been admitted that would have substantially bolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence. That statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is harmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying the Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in Mr. Fry's  \n If I could come back to, may I ask this question: Is part of your argument that even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n This is a case, am I correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then a five-week deliberation in this case? And there was a harmless   and the testimony of Maples was she had seen a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?\n Correct, Your Honor.\n Where is that in the question presented?\n It says that if the Brecht standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear the burden? I guess that's the narrower question, who has the burden.\n Well, the Respondent has essentially conceded that under O'Neal that they bear the risk of non-persuasion.\n But O'Neal, I thought O'Neal just says that this word \"burden of proof\" is out of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading the record.\n I think that that was what the holding in the majority opinion was, but I think, as Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion, the effect of that is to allocate the risk of non-persuasion to the State. And so I think that that's   I could be wrong, but it seems to me a semantic point. And to Justice Stevens' question, as you pointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard which this court adopted in Brecht is an exacting standard. And in applying that standard, if you'd look at this case, the Court's decisions, Sullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the jury. Here we have a jury in the third trial that deliberated for 23 court days after 29 court days  \n You're now arguing that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is that the point you're making?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n Okay. Now, I didn't hear the answer to my question. I'm not sure that is in the question that you presented and on which we granted cert. It says which standard applies, who bears the burden. I don't see anything saying is this   was it erroneous to conclude that this was harmless under Brecht.\n Well, I believe, number one, does it matter which standard applies as part of the question presented? Does it matter which harmless error standard is implied? My answer to that is no, because Mr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman. And this Court could in this case simply decide this case on that very narrow question, like many court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply, Brecht or Chapman, when there has been no Chapman analysis in the State court or when there has been an objectively unreasonable Chapman analysis in the State court. Most courts confronted with that issue say, we don't need to decide the question here because either the error was plainly harmless under both of those standards or plainly not harmless under both of these standards. And I simply recounted the history of the litigation below in the Federal courts to point out that this could be a case where that make a difference. It seems like  \n The trouble with reading that second question that way is that, you know, it follows from your first question, which speaks in the generality of cases. It's not speaking to this case. Your first question presented is, if constitutional error in a State trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman or in Brecht? That's the first question. Very generalized. Second question: Does it matter which harmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I thought it meant, you know, is there any difference between the two standards? Don't you think that's fair reading of it.\n No, Your Honor.\n You think it means, does it matter in this case which harmless   you think that second sentence means would, would the defendant be entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which harmless error standard is employed? You think that's what it means?\n I think that that is the import of that portion of the question.\n Is that a question on which we would be likely to grant cert?\n Perhaps not if that was the only question in and of itself, but perhaps so because, as I indicated before, as Justice Stevens stressed in his concurring opinion in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard is a demanding standard. And look at this case. If the error in this case can be deemed harmless under any standard, then what cannot? What is prejudice when you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury where nine days into the deliberations at least five of them voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty. They told the judge that they were at an impasse. This jury struggled mightily with this evidence.\n Would you help me with one thing I'm not terribly clear about, though. Is it clear which   what side the magistrate thought had the burden of persuasion?\n It is not, and it seems as though, looking at the language that the magistrate judge utilized in his findings and recommendations, that he was looking to me, to Mr. Fry, to meet that burden. And I quoted his language in my brief and to the Ninth Circuit and I argued to the Ninth Circuit that the burden of persuasion had been improperly allocated to Mr. Fry. However, that issue was simply not addressed in the Ninth Circuit's opinion.\n Does your opponent now concede that the State has the burden?\n Yes, Respondent concedes that their burden   that it's their burden  \n How do they say that after I thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the Court which said this concept is not applicable in   when you're reviewing a record for harmless error. It's not a question of presenting evidence. What I think it said is that it's not a question of presentation of evidence. In such a case, we think it's conceptually clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge think that the error substantially influenced the judge's   the jury's decision? Now, maybe I was wrong, but I think there was a majority of the Court that agreed with it.\n Yes, Your Honor. And I think your point, as I understood it, in O'Neal was that it analytically does not make sense  \n To talk about burdens of proof?\n   when the appellate court is  \n Yes. But that's my basic question in this case and it's a serious question. Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can conscientiously review a record and decide for myself whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, and if I really try I can bring myself to understand this question. Regardless of what I think, could another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have thought the opposite? I can do that mentally. You try to get me to make more fine distinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm sorry. I admit it. Now, if that's the state of mind that I can get myself into   and I believe that's true of many judges   how do I write words that are realistic in this area?\n I think that that's a question, Your Honor, that this court has struggled with. As Justice Scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in Dominguez Benitez, that we're talking about with these harmless error standards ineffable gradations of probability that are beyond even the judicial mind to grasp. But I think if we just tie it to the facts of this case, I think that in the explanation you just gave that there is no reasonable judge who could look at this case and conclude  \n There are many situations in which an appellate court has to apply a legal standard to facts in criminal cases and civil cases. In a criminal case, an issue on appeal could be whether there's sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Do you think there's a burden of persuasion on appeal on all of those issues?\n With respect to a standard sufficiency analysis, no, Justice Alito. It's just a question for the appellate judge to discern, was there sufficient evidence in the record reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\n What's the difference between that and applying any harmless error standard? It's exactly the same kind of analysis. It's a different legal test, but you're applying, you're applying the law to facts.\n I agree. And I don't quarrel at all with the way that the court described   said that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless error inquiry in the O'Neal case, that it doesn't fit to look at it in terms of the allocation of burden. I don't think that this case ultimately turns on that, except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted by the district court judge did state that he was looking to Mr. Fry to make the sufficient showing  \n Are you talking about what's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix? That was the only place that I found where the magistrate expressed a view on this. It reads: \"The court does not find that there has been\"   \"the court does find that there has been an insufficient showing. So that \"insufficient showing\" means showing by the Petitioner.\" Is that what you're relying on?\n Yes. That's exactly what I'm relying on, Your Honor. So, going back to specifically the facts of this case, this Court could, as I indicated earlier, without regard to the thorny Chapman versus Brecht question, decide this case solely in terms of, under Brecht, does Mr. Fry prevail; and we look at the nature of the constitutional violation that occurred.\n That wouldn't help us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which standard is applicable, though, right?\n No, it certainly would not, Your Honor. And this Court may very well deem that to be necessary. But I think also that this Court fashioning a decision which is faithful to the requirement that   or the principle that Kotteakos is an exacting standard, would also be an important constitutional principle. In a case like this, where there has been no Chapman review and where the Chapman court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error standard in order to safeguard convictions, safeguard against erroneous convictions where there is a close question of guilt or innocence, that hasn't happened in this case and it would be appropriate for this Court to fashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure that that happens.\n And that would put 2254 out of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a Federal conviction then it's always Brecht on post-conviction relief?\n As I understand that question, the Solicitor General pointed out in the introduction of its amicus brief that there are some 2255 cases where there's been an intervening change in the law which could involve this question of Brecht versus Chapman. And I've cited in my brief a district court case, United States versus Monsanto, where the court concluded, in accordance with the position that I'm advocating, that it makes no sense for a reviewing court in a habeas proceeding to apply the Brecht standard blindly without regard to what was done in prior proceedings, but rather there's no need for deference, where the   the big issue in Brecht, as I understand it, was this Court was concerned about simply repeating a harmless error analysis that the State court had already done; and we're not asking this Court to do that in this case. The same concern, Justice Ginsburg, holds over in certain limited 2255 cases. If I may save the balance of my time.\n Thank you, Mr. Haltom. Mr. Moody.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal habeas is limited in scope and purpose. It is not a continuation of the appellate process. Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State sovereignty. In Brecht, this court held that the stringent Chapman standard was inappropriate for use on collateral review. Instead, in order to strike a proper balance between State and Federal interests, the actual prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect on the verdict should be used in collateral cases. Petitioner is asking for an exception to this rule. He claims that if he did not receive Chapman review in State court, he should receive it on Federal habeas. That was not the rule in Brecht and it should not be adopted by this Court here. The Brecht decision did not state an exception based on the State standard used. The key in Brecht was that appropriate balance between the Federal Government and the State. This Court has never treated cases where there was not a state Chapman finding differently from other cases. It applies Brecht throughout. In the Penry case and in the O'Neal case there was no Chapman finding in state court, yet this Court applied Brecht and made no comment about that.\n You said in your brief that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should have sought cert   direct review from the State court's conviction. Did you say that?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n But realistically, the likelihood that such a petition would be successful, passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would grant cert on such a question is very slim.\n I agree, the likelihood of the cert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not change the fact that once you come to court under 2254, you are asking for collateral review. And in collateral review, it's inappropriate to apply the Chapman standard.\n I suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under 2254, that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible?\n I, I agree with that, Your Honor.\n Counsel, if the State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously, how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas? You would ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?\n Yes, Your Honor. First you would ask if it was an unreasonable application of Chapman. If you found that it was not, then the case is over, there's no need to grant the writ. If you found that it was, you would proceed and do a Brecht analysis. And that's what we learned from  \n That seems awfully refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses? Is this an   is this an unreasonable application of Chapman? And then apply the Brecht standard after determining that it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?\n I don't disagree. I'm merely trying to make sense of the various decisions in this, in this arena. There's some tension between the Esparza decision and other decisions of the Court; and one has to find a place for AEDPA standard. So we would not object to simply an application of Brecht which is what this Court has always done. But as far as it seems to suggest there may be an interim step.\n Suppose we apply Brecht. This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG in the briefs. He states them very well. The first is let's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded. Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of   an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence. So that's their finding on the merits. Then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. How could both those things be true? How could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? That's one thing they say. But the exclusion was harmless. I just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.\n I think that the explanation is as follows. When you're analyzing the denial of a defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first look to see how it fit into the defense. And that is what they were doing. You're not looking at the entire case. You're looking only at the defense. And so in the sense that something is better than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven may improve the defense case. And yet nonetheless, when you move to the next question, which is, was there a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking at everything that was available to the jury   it may be that there was still so much other evidence that it could overcome whatever increase you received on the defense.\n Why is it necessary for us to try to reconcile those two statements? The Ninth Circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for purposes of the question that's presented to us. So why shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question independently of what they said about whether there was a Chambers violation?\n We would not object to that. I'm trying to   I'm trying to assist Justice Breyer in that perceived imbalance between a finding of a substance above and then a finding of harmless error before.\n Well, every time evidence is excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the equivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's not a constitutional error under Chambers and related cases, is there?\n Yes. We agree. That's certainly the law of this Court. And in this, in   well, let me move on. I'd like to make a couple of other points.\n May I go just back to Justice Breyer's question for a second?\n Sure.\n And I mean, I think your answer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as sort of a general statement. But in   would you agree that in this case, if we   if we do proceed, number one, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and we then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine whether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this particular case, the, the record indicates that the case was so close that there would have to be a finding of harmful error, or at least it would be impossible to find harmless error. Even applying Brecht clear. And you know what I'm getting at. I mean, five weeks of deliberation. The question after, whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on. Obviously this   this case was just to tottering on the edge. So even if we, if we do get to the point of applying Brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that he's   he gets no relief under Brecht?\n No, I would disagree with that. You've the sixth court to hear this case. The prior five have all rejected his claim. And while  \n But two or three of those did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now, don't you?\n No, I don't agree with that.\n For purposes of argument.\n For purposes of argument I do. The district court and the Ninth Circuit both applied Brecht and found that this was not an error which  \n It was two to one in the Ninth Circuit.\n This is true.\n Judge Rawlinson I think said that using the Brecht standard, that there was actual prejudice.\n Yes, she did. There was a dissent in the Ninth Circuit.\n Isn't this the   I may have it wrong   but isn't this the case in which the witness was unique not cumulative because she was the only one who was completely disinterested.\n No. I would disagree with that. She's been characterized that way. But, and I want to point out that, I would like to clarify the record in response to your question, Justice Stevens. You asked whether or not she saw another man commit the murder. And counsel appeared to agree with you. That was not her testimony. Her testimony was that she overheard someone else confessing to murders that may or may not have been these murders. And the   and this was a very long case. This case lasted eleven weeks, it involved a hundred witnesses. You can look at the opinions it produced in state court and in the district court. They're each 100 pages long. It's not unreasonable to expect the jury to take a long time to decide that case. Now there are 25 court days of deliberations  \n Five, five weeks?\n Five weeks, 25 court days, 24 of which were taken up with read back. Several   several holidays. I mean if you want to go through and look at it, now  \n Do you know of any other case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?\n I haven't attempted to find one. It is a long deliberation.\n I'm sure there's an example somewhere, but I   I practiced law for over 40 years, and I never heard of it.\n At what point, how many weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?\n I believe that was   I keep, I've been switching back and forth between calendar days and court days. So forgive me. I believe that was on the eighth court day. And at that point, when they announced they were hung, they selected a new foreperson and then rolled up their sleeves and went back in and deliberated the case.\n So  \n And after  \n Go ahead.\n After they selected the new foreperson, they asked for 15 read backs, including the crucial evidence in the case. The ballistics experts. They asked for that. They asked for the testimony of the in-custody witness who heard the confession of Mr. Fry. They asked for Mr. Fry's testimony.\n Did they ask for a read back of Mrs. Maples' testimony?\n Well, Mrs. Maples' testimony was not admitted. It was excluded.\n Oh, that's right. Of course.\n But they did not   significantly they did not ask for read back of the witnesses who testified similarly to, to Ms. Maples. The third party culpability case was basically not credited by the jury. They did not a read back of those witnesses.\n Well, maybe, maybe you'd end up  \n Well, maybe a critical witness was left out. That argues the other way, I think.\n I would encourage the Court to carefully look at what Ms. Maples was going to say. If you look in her own words, and I'm quoting: I was just in and out of the room. I just listened to bits and pieces of it. And that's at joint appendix 10. This, this witness may have been Mr. Hurtz's cousin, and not his ex-girlfriend, or his ex-girlfriend's mother, but she did not have very much to say about this. She said she didn't hear the beginning of the statement. She could not tell you whether it was a serious discussion. She was in and out of the room. She heard only bits and pieces.\n But what she heard was that they were going to kill, this other person was going to kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was the crime at issue.\n With respect, that's not what she heard.\n What did she hear?\n What she heard was a statement that he had killed a man and a woman. And this was not immediately after the offense. This is 18 months after the offense, this is not next day.\n Do you think   do you think, do you think I should do this? I'm still looking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are, having this Court announce too many six-part tests, and having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a mistake for a judge and then you never finish a proceeding. I'm worried about that, as are you.\n Yes.\n At the same time, I think what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge. Not what   quite what the test says. So there has to be a conscientious effort to decide, was there   was it harmless? Could a reasonable jurist in California have concluded the opposite? Okay. So maybe we should do it in this case. We simply try ourselves to go through this record, make that determination to show by example, rather than by trying to find a form of words.\n Well, you don't do it very often. I understand that that's something you could do if you wanted to. I think that this is just a classic case where two courts applied the Brecht standard and reached their conclusions and there's nothing really remarkable about it.\n The third party perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or Hearst?\n Hurtz. Yes.\n And there   there was a link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship between Hurtz and the victim?\n That's right.\n Was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through Maples?\n Actually, I'm thinking about my answer because I was thinking about Borelli. There were three third party culpability, potential targets in this case. And I believe that Hurtz, the testimony of several of the witness who were admitted did testify of a link between Cindy Bell and Hurtz.\n Otherwise, I mean, they couldn't have found it was cumulative if   if that had not been the case.\n In order to   I need to correct the record on that as well. The trial judge did not find that this was cumulative. He found a lack of foundation. What happened was, was Ms. Maples was offered as a witness  \n But   on appellate review in California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?\n The alternative prejudice holding, the footnote 17, they said it would have been cumulative.\n Right. Okay.\n Yes.\n And they   they couldn't have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on Hurtz, apart from Maples?\n Oh, that's right. Yes. There was, and that's really my point. My point is that 11 third party culpability witnesses were allowed to testify in this trial. And one was excluded.\n How did Hurtz's name enter into the trial?\n Well  \n Why did anybody mention him?\n Well, for one thing, he was called to testify and asked if he killed these people. Mr. Hurtz testified at this trial. The jury got to see him, they got to look him in the eye, they got to hear him on direct, they got to hear him on cross. And they did not ask for a read back of that testimony.\n And if Maples' testimony had come in, I presume they could have cross-examined him on the basis of Maples' testimony?\n Well, he stated he never said he killed these people. And he, he stated he'd never said he killed a man and a woman in a car. So it   it went to what Maples would have said, and also  \n Did he say he'd killed peoples otherwise, or at other times? (Laughter.)\n He also denied doing that.\n Well, but then at that point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction   Maples' testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation, becomes more relevant.\n I would disagree, simply because she says she didn't hear the conversation well enough to really give her testimony any true probative value in the case because she was in and out of the room. She didn't hear the beginning. She didn't hear the end. And when she's asked, was it a serious discussion, she says, I don't know. So this could be   this could be something very different  \n That's classic going to the weight of the evidence. That goes to the weight, not the admissibility.\n Ordinarily I would agree with that. And if we knew, Your Honor, that he was speaking about these killings, then certainly it would go to the weight. But since he was speaking about killings that she said she didn't know if they were in California, New Jersey, she didn't know when they occurred, and therefore   in California we ask that before you present third party culpability evidence you tie it to this crime.\n So we don't assume that he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?\n Well, it's   he may have committed other killings, but if did not confess to committing these killings then there's no probative value to her testimony.\n Do you think the question of the application of Brecht is included within the questions presented?\n No. I briefed it because I was concerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't think it is fairly presented. The only other point that I wanted to make is that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will basically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a near wholesale application of Chapman on collateral review. As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many times Petitioners come to court and they have a case where there was no finding of constitutional error in State court and therefore no Chapman application, but they're going to assert that in Federal court. And so if in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then you really have reduced application of Brecht.\n But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.\n I don't think we should assume that the State courts are going to do that. I think that what   it's sort of like what we said earlier in the argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary ruling is a constitutional violation. I would say most of them are not. And this Court has not drawn a bright line of exactly where that is. So in many cases, this is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best. And so, therefore, the State court would not be going to a Chapman standard because it would not be finding error. And with that, I'm prepared to submit.\n Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett?\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The distinction between collateral review and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review for harmlessness in collateral review become the same standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it. That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this Court. He got Chapman review. They cited Chapman. They didn't cite it here. That's the only difference. Mr. Brecht came to this Court and said they unreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it again on habeas, and this Court said that there is a deep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral review and direct review and that distinction turns upon the fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a long record where difficult calls were made. It is to correct fundamental miscarriages of justice, grievous wrongs that have caused custody in violation of constitutional  \n May I ask two questions and then you can proceed. One, do you take a position on who has the burden of persuasion? That's the first question. And do you have an opinion on proper application of Brecht in this case?\n If I can adopt Justice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this Court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of burden of persuasion. We accept O'Neal's holding what then there is equipoise, which did not what happened in this case, the tie goes to  \n But you do agree if it were in equipoise the State would have the burden?\n The tie would go to the prisoner, yes. Were it in equipoise, because the State would have the burden the State would lose. I don't think that's what happened in this case. I think what Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court and what the judge will say in, what the court said in O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially contributed to the jury's verdict? And that is essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very bottom when it said \"The court doesn't find that there's an insufficient showing\"   that's the same way of saying I haven't been persuaded   that the error contributed to the verdict. So I don't think that this case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it the burden of persuasion or the proper level of conviction on the part of the court. This court was not persuaded and that is all that matters. When the court is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner loses. The second question you asked was whether we have a position on application of Brecht, and we do. We've laid it out in our brief. We think that in no sense does this record support the notion, support the argument, that there was a substantial and injurious effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was excluded, talking about third party culpability. And that requires not just looking at what, in isolation, what evidence was in there about Mr. Hurtz. There was I think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him either say he did it or he was there or he was involved. But it requires looking at the whole record. And there were   the defense here was not a Hurtz versus Fry. This was a case where the defense did an excellent job. It was a well defended case, and threw up a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it bought on. In the third trial you had what you didn't had in the prior trials. You had ballistics evidence that linked his gun to the crime. You have his own admission, his own testimony, that he left the house that night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out in the truck that was seen at   a truck of the same type, that was seen at the crime scene.\n I have the same problem Justice Souter does, in all candor. The jury takes five weeks to decide the case and there's a fairly interesting bit of testimony that doesn't get in. And to say to be totally satisfied it didn't have an injurious effect on the deliberations is a close question, I think.\n Well, two answers. If it's a close question, if AEDPA and if Kotteakos and Brecht mean anything, it's that the close calls go to the State and are not overturned by the sixth court on review.\n No, but an equally divided call goes the other way.\n I'm sorry?\n If it's not just a close call, but if it's equal, it goes the other way.\n It is, and no one has thought this was equal. The two courts   the three courts, the California Court of Appeals also said in any event there's no possible prejudice. Now, how they could say no possible prejudice under a State standard and still say, ah, but it would have affected the verdict under Chapman, is not something I'm able to understand. So I think you have  \n Neither am I. But I draw a different conclusion from it from the one you're drawing.\n I guess I misunderstand your point, because I think when the court said there's no possible prejudice  \n I mean, I cannot accept the State   the conclusion that there was no possible prejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment ago and I a moment before sort of put out. I just do not find that a reasonable conclusion.\n Well, again, even if the Court thinks there may have been some chance, may have been   you know   relevant testimony   this Court can well disagree and can conclude that this was abuse of discretion. If it were Federal Rule of Evidence 403, you could decide this was a an abuse of discretion. Whether it was unconstitutional, so clearly unconstitutional as to merit under AEDPA and under Brecht reversal of the conviction 12 years after the fact  \n I thought the AEDPA question was out of it because that hasn't been   there was no cross-appeal on that question. I thought it was a given, a given in this case, that the California courts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law. I didn't think that was an issue in the case. I think we took it on the assumption that it was such an error.\n Again, the Respondents in this case have not conceded constitutional error, and in their brief they repeat that. And I think there's a question whether a court should  \n It's not raised here. There was no cross-appeal from that.\n Well, a Respondent is entitled to defend on any ground supported by the record. But even assuming that, we'll assume the error, assumes that there was an error and one assumes that it was   which is hard for me to get to, but one assumes it was clearly unconstitutional in this close call, the type of call that's made hundreds of times in every trial, balancing this, and the combination of lack of foundation and cumulativeness. It's hard for me to understand when that rises to the level of unconstitutionality. But if we assume that it did, you have the two courts that applied the Brecht standard here. And the district court decision here is nearly 100 pages long. It's a very careful, methodical analysis.\n That's because there were many, many issues raised.\n There's many issues, but also it was being careful and it was being very methodical. And it went through this and it went through this record. That court went through true this record, more than 5,000 transcript pages, 11 week of trial, more than 100 witnesses. And it was on that  \n I suppose if we're going to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would have to do the same thing.\n I think that's what this Court has said. The other thing I want to get back to is the question about the length of jury deliberations. Sure, this was really wrong. Now, they changed forepersons in midstream and got a reasonable doubt instruction repeated. Who knows what happened. But what I will not concede   I will concede it's long, but I will not concede that the mere fact of length of deliberations says anything about if this one particular error in applying a balancing test substantially affected the verdict. I think the length of deliberations is so incredibly speculative.\n You will concede it was a close case, won't you?\n I will concede it was, I will concede it was a difficult case.\n If you take five weeks it's pretty clearly a close case.\n That's right. But you know, the whole the point of federal habeas corpus is that this is not filling in the gaps in direct review. We're not going to give you  \n There's no evidence or inference that it was close on the alternative murderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples' testimony goes to.\n That's exactly right. In fact, if you look at the closing arguments, Mr. Hurtz has a couple of references in a two-day closing argument. That was not the centerpiece of his case.\n It has to be close on an alternative murderer. It wasn't suicide. Obviously, if he didn't do it, somebody else did. So if it's a close case from the first, it's obviously a close case for the second.\n No, but as to who did it and whether Hurtz did it or whether   remember, what the defense is trying to show is not who did it; it's that this person didn't do it, and whether it was them or someone else is what we don't know. Again, this is Federal habeas corpus before this Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court has in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were involved, was so   that simply disallowed the twelfth out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the verdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years after the crime. And yes, the jury   it was close in the sense that they worked a long hard time. But at the end of the day, they were unanimous. There's nothing close about unanimous. And I think it would be the wrong message to say that a jury that works as hard as this one did, did the readbacks, culled through this record  \n Yes, but we don't know what they would have done if they had this evidence that was excluded. That's the problem.\n One never knows that in habeas corpus. But what you do when you look at what they were focusing on, they were focusing on the two ballistics experts. They had them read back right next each other. They made that call. It's their job to do it.\n But the reason they may have been doing that is that they may very well have thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to know was whether the evidence going specifically to this defendant was strong enough to overcome it.\n May I answer? One would have expected at least one readback on third party culpability instead of three readbacks of Mr. Fry's testimony which put himself that night with the gun in the truck, and which he said   you know   and beforehand he agreed he might have said he wanted to blow them away. Thank you.\n Thank you, counsel. Mr. Haltom, you have three minutes remaining.\n Thank you. The trial counsel  \n Mr. Haltom, before you go drifting, counsel, into the evidentiary questions in the case, I have one question. Two cases. A, Hurtz did not testify at all. B, he did. Is the foundation ruling any different in the two cases insofar as Maples' testimony or is it the same? I.e., is there a lesser showing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?\n I think that possibly the foundation with Hurtz there could be increased. The jury sought Mr. Hurtz.\n Oh, you mean, oh, you mean more? You have to be more strict for foundation after Hurtz testified? I was suggesting the opposite.\n Well, I was just thinking that his presence there would be relevant. The jury actually saw him. They heard a truck driver describing, a neutral truck driver, describing the actual killer, who in no way fit the description of Mr. Fry. Unfortunately, the record doesn't indicate what Mr. Hurtz looked like, but the jury saw it. And if the jury saw that that truck driver was describing a man that looked like Mr. Hurtz, then that  \n But there were all kinds of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony, including the time, the timing of the murder.\n There were infirmities in his testimony, Your Honor. However, he came from Missouri, so maybe he was looking at a Missouri clock. We don't know. But why would that man make up a story? He has no axe to grind in this case. And then his testimony is corroborated by a gentleman who sees him immediately after it and says: He looked like he had just seen a ghost, and described seeing a double execution-style murder. Now  \n That was all presented to the jury, right?\n That was all presented to the jury. However, Ms. Maples' testimony was not, and counsel did not argue that heavily focused on Mr. Hurtz' guilt. She certainly did argue it, but the reason that she didn't is because, as the Court of Appeals, the California Court of Appeals, said, the other seven witnesses who said Mr. Hurtz said he had killed the Bells were all described as having been flimsy witness who gave contradictory unbelievable testimony.\n Well, how strong is this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and didn't   couldn't tell whether he was talking about something that happened 10 years before or 2 days before?\n Mr. Chief Justice, she was extremely strong. Page JA-78 in the joint appendix, Respondent concedes she was the only unbiased witness concerning Mr. Hurtz's   concerning Mr. Hurtz. She heard this, her cousin, saying he shot a man and a woman in a parked car, first shooting the woman in the head, then shooting the man, getting blood all over himself. That linked up with all the other confessions in this case. Interlinking confessions just like in Chambers were deemed to provide adequate assurance of reliability.\n Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1995 Congress acted decisively to curb abusive private securities litigation. It took the extraordinary step of rejecting categorically the traditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that are filed under the securities laws. Instead it declared that, and this is at page 2 of our petition, \"The complaint shall state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" The fundamental error in the court of appeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the statute the strong inference language that Congress clearly intended to be not only in those statutes, but obviously applied rigorously.\n At some point during your argument   and I know you only have 20 minutes   will you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading standard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is the same as the instruction that's given to the jury? Because if it isn't, then the Seventh Amendment argument may have some more force.\n I think the answer to the question is that it does not have to be the same. I think Congress actually has greater authority in dealing with pleadings that is distinct from the Seventh Amendment right, but the Court doesn't need to go that far in this particular case because I think the inferences that we are asking the Court to draw from the record in this case would avoid any  \n Well, in writing   I take it, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more likely than not, preponderance of the evidence.\n That's what the Court held   held in Huddleston, yes, Your Honor.\n So your submission is, maybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of the case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must basically apply a standard of fact   standard of proof that's higher than that what the jury would.\n Well, it's important as a standard of allegation, because what we're talking about here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers, and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the plaintiffs. So I do think it's removed. I mean, this Court has really never addressed the issue of the extent to which the Seventh Amendment extends to pleadings. And I don't think this is the case in which to take up that issue because I think it is quite clear that what at least we're asking for as the appropriate interpretation of the Reform Act is that you need to apply   that you simply follow Matushita and Monsanto, and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that innocent explanations can be set aside. And if you take that particular approach, which clearly is consistent with the Seventh Amendment, then it seems to me you   the Seventh that you followed under the Constitution, is eliminated.\n Mr. Phillips, the Seventh Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line it's has the plaintiff proved a claim. But you're stating two different claims. The claim that must be stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be proved, and I don't know of any other instance where that is so.\n I don't know that there are any other instances in which that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it's a constitutional problem. I think at the end of the day the question is, does Congress have the power to enforce its view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter of policy at the pleadings stage, and I think the answer to that question is yes. But again, you don't have to  \n I wasn't asking it as a matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do you construe these words, what is it, \"strong inference?\" And the words come out of, as I understand it, a Second Circuit decision. So I would think the most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied. But your definition of strong inference is quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.\n Well, I'm not sure that's 100 percent true. I think the real problem with the Second Circuit is there's no monolithic Second Circuit rule that's out there. The Second Circuit applied a number of cases under its particularity standards under 9(b) prior to the time Congress adopted the strong inference standard. Some of them   I think we would be very comfortable with the analysis in Shields versus Citytrust Bank, for instance. The way Judge Jacobs analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way we're trying to analyze the complaint in this case. So if you  \n Mr. Phillips, can I ask this question?\n I'm sorry.\n One of the amicus briefs talks in terms of the percentages, how likely the inference, the word strong inference means 50 percent, 30 percent, 60 percent. Do you think the inference has to be stronger or less strong than the inference of probable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to get access to the privacy of a home and so forth?\n I think it would have to be stronger than that, although I don't know how to translate that into percentages, Justice Stevens.\n A civil case would impose a higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case than they would for getting access to a citizen's private papers and the like?\n I think the use of the language \"strong inference\" carries with it a very significant burden that has to be demonstrated by the buyer.\n A burden of over 50 percent?\n Oh, to be sure.\n In a criminal case, the person seeking that action is a government officer who presumptively is not acting out of selfish motives, whereas we're talking about private suits and some private litigants are selfish.\n Absolutely, Justice Scalia. And if you read the Securities Industries amicus brief, it ticks off all of the instances of harm that are caused by allowing   too much of the private litigation is precisely that, which Congress was responding to.\n I just have to make it clear. Is the high likelihood, or strong inference, is greater than more likely than not?\n Yes. I believe Congress would have intended it to be more  \n Doesn't the   doesn't the standard at the pleading stage have to be the same as the standard at the summary judgment stage? If   suppose that a certain set of facts is sufficient to defeat summary judgment. If the plaintiff alleges all of those facts in the complaint, are you saying that that complaint could be dismissed even though supporting those facts at the summary judgment stage would be enough to defeat a summary judgment motion?\n I think at the end of the day I would make that argument. I don't have to make that argument here because it's clear to me that the same standards of Matushita and Monsanto that say you have to exclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary judgment stage as we're trying to apply at the pleading stage, so there is no disconnect. But if I were actually forced into that position, I think I would take that view, although I probably would argue first that the standard of Huddleston ought to be reconsidered, rather than rejecting clearly what Congress had in mind in 1995 when it acted to curb the abuses of private securities litigation.\n But isn't the difference between Matsushita and this particular case at least as you are presenting this case, the   the   focused on the strength of this exclusion of innocent conduct? As, as I recall Matsushita, there   there had to be at that stage, there had to be evidence from which one could infer that the   that the conduct was not innocent; but you're arguing for something stronger than that. You're arguing for, in effect, an   an ultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct. And aren't you asking for more than just what Matsushita did at   at that later stage?\n I think there may be a slight semantic difference there, but the truth is at end of the day all we're asking for the Court to do is to evaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the negative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities, interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you traditionally do, take into account whether there is an allegation of motive, and say at the end of the day whether or not that reaches a   rises to the level of a strong inference.\n But   but Matsushita as I recall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a plausible inference. And I think you're arguing for something stronger than that. And I think the language of Congress forces you to do it but I   I'm just finding it difficult to conclude   to equate the plausibility standard in, in Matsushita with the strong inference standard here. If you  \n Well, if I'm going to err on either side, I obviously prefer that the Court carries out Congress's intent. We thing you needn't go any further than Matsushita did in order to reverse the court of appeals in this particular case. Obviously there is probably some potential distance between the two, where you could certainly interpret the strong inference standard more in the line the way the United States interprets it, as creating a high likelihood of scienter. And we don't   we're certainly not objecting to that. We're just saying to the Court that you needn't go that far in order to decide this case, although obviously we would welcome a ruling along those lines if the Court's inclined to go that far.\n Is it fair to say at the pleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and convincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it would only be more probable than not?\n Well, again, I think it   I think it puts an issue   and we raised this in our reply brief, whether or not Huddleston should be reconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in the way Congress is approaching private securities litigation. But, so my  \n So you do  \n There are a number of ways to go at it. But if it turned out to be a disconnect, that would not offend at least my sense of what Congress was trying to achieve here.\n Yeah. Well, I don't think Congress was trying to achieve an alteration in the ultimate standard, either, in the jury standard. What it was concerned with is the enormous expense of   of discovery. And, and tried to set a high wall to get to the discovery stage. I don't know why that should have to affect or should logically affect the standard that the jury is told to use.\n All I'm suggesting is that if the Court were concerned that somehow there is a disconnect between the pleading standard and the ultimate standard of proof, the way to resolve that incongruity   if it is one   would to be reconsider the ultimate standard of proof, not to throw out the clearly congressionally approved baby as part of that bath water.\n Can you tell me a little bit of how   how this should work in your view? Assume the CEO makes misstatements as to the earnings report and the acceptance of one of its new products. Just assume that.\n Right.\n Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows what his own earnings reports are?\n You mean with a specific earnings report rather than just simply sort of sales projections and demand?\n Can we make a strong inference that a CEO knows the status of current earnings  \n Well, my guess is they  \n   when he makes, when he makes a statement.\n Well, I think they would have to make an allegation that the   that the CEO routinely is provided with that information rather than simply assume it. I think it's the same problem you have with their   with their allegation that it's common sense that CEOs will act to protect their own personal self interest and the overall welfare of the company by misrepresenting the status of events.\n How about just saying that he knew it?\n I'm not  \n Just saying that he knew it. Without saying why they knew that he knew it? You're saying they have to give a reason why they knew that he knew it, namely he routinely read these reports? Suppose they didn't say that. They just said knowing that the   that the figures were otherwise, he   he set them forth.\n I don't think that's sufficient, because it requires for the facts that particularly show  \n But suppose it says, which I think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed on top of the company's financial health by having weekly conversations with other executives. He had his hands on the pulse of the company. He saw weekly sales reports and product   projection   production projections. Now it seems like an allegation that's very specific.\n But the   but the problem with that allegation, and we're talking about the 6500, the Titan 6500 product specifically, in that context, the report is, there's nothing in there that says what those reports say about the 6500. And remember, this is a case where the plaintiffs have 27 whistleblowers inside the company who could provide you with all of the detail in the world; and yet when it comes time to tell you what was in the 6500 report that would   that would suggest that it's not available, there's not word one in the allegation.\n Well, I thought they alleged at least that for about a year previously in respect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout the company that the 6500 had been delayed. Don't they make an allegation like that?\n Right but that's   that being delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim. The question was is the, is the 6500 being sold; and that was the allegation. And the answer to that is he   I   he had every reason to believe that, based on what they've claimed because they've not produced a report or said that there's anything inside the report that says to the contrary about that. Again, it seems to me  \n The 6500 has long been delayed. Everyone knows that in the company. So he knows it's long been delayed.\n I think  \n Then what he says is it is being shipped and delivered. Something like that.\n But Justice Breyer, that   that long been delayed period runs all the way back to 1998. And we're talking about events in 2000 and 2001. So the notion that it's been long delayed says nothing about what Mr. Notebaert was   was revealing in March and April and June of 2001. It, it could potentially, but it equally, it couldn't. It's the same problem you get with the 5500, where the court of appeals specifically said it is quite plausible that Mr. Notebaert never saw those reports. Now how you can make that concession and nevertheless say there is a strong inference that he acted to deceive, strikes me as absolutely implausible.\n April '01, he says everything we can build we are building, and shipping. The demand is very strong. And then what they say is of course nobody wanted any of it, it was long delayed, and they've known that since 1998 and he has his finger on the pulse of the company.\n But you   you   Justice Breyer, you make a leap there.\n Oh. Yeah.\n Is that they all knew that. The point is they knew that it was delayed back in 1999. What they don't do is tie that in to what he knew in 2001; and that, to me, that's the central point in this case, is do you require that kind of specificity? And it seems to me there's no other way to read what Congress says in this statute than to that. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n Thank you Mr. Phillips. Mr. Shanmugam.\n Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: While meritorious private actions are an essential supplement to Government enforcement of the securities laws, abusive action impose substantial costs on companies and their shareholders. As a cornerstone of its effort in the Reform Act to address the problem of abusive actions, Congress adopted uniform and more stringent pleading requirements including the strong inference requirement at issue in this case. The court of appeals erred by holding that a plaintiff can satisfy that requirement simply by alleging facts which an inference of state of mind could be drawn. The court of appeals thereby misinterpreted the Reform Act. And  \n Do you have a position on Justice Alito's earlier question about whether the standard at the summary judgment stage is the same as the standard at the pleading stage?\n First of all to be clear, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't believe that the Court needs to address that question in this case, because we don't believe that that sort of disparity would present any Seventh Amendment concerns. However, if the Court does believe that any disparity in the degree of probability required does present Seventh Amendment concerns, we believe that it is more consistent with Congress's intent to apply the strong inference requirement at the proof stage as well as the pleading stage rather than to water down the strong inference requirement that Congress adopted at the pleading stage. And we believe that that requirement does impose a very high burden. In our view, it requires a plaintiff to allege facts that give rise to a high likelihood that the conclusion that the defendant acted with the necessary date of mind follows from those allegations.\n And by the proof stage you mean both summary judgment and submission to jury?\n I think that that is right, Justice Kennedy. I suppose that if the perceived constitutional concern is solely regarding the degree of likelihood that is required, it could be applied simply at the summary judgment stage; but to the extent that the Court believes that it is a matter for the jury to determine whether a given set of facts gives rise to an inference of the requisite strength then yes, the jury would need to be instructed in a manner consistent with the strong  \n What would you think about the following  \n May I just   may I just, very briefly. . Putting aside the constitutional problem, do you think the standards are the same or different between the pleading stage and the constitutional stage   and the summary judgment stage?\n Well, again, we don't believe that the Court needs to address that question.\n I understand that. That's not my question.\n And the statute by its terms only  \n It is either a yes or no question.\n Well, I think that the answer is yes if the Court feels it needs to address that question. And to be sure, the strong inference standard that Congress adopted was framed only in terms of the pleading stage. And our view  \n   there was a pleading stage, I would like your clear view on how much that changes. It has been the understanding that when there is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the complaint and you construe the allegations in that complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Is that rule not applied under the interpretation you are giving us of strong inference?\n I think that it is, Justice Ginsburg, to this limited extent. In an ordinary civil case, the case is governed of course by Rule 8. And in some sense the rule that the allegations in the complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff is really derived from Rule 8 and its requirement that a plaintiff need only provide a shortened claim statement of the relevant underlying facts in order to survive a motion to dismiss. What Congress did in the Reform Act was to require first of all some degree of particularity in allegation; but Congress went further than that; and to the extent that Congress spoke in terms of the inferences that can be drawn from those allegations, we do believe that Congress abrogated the background rule that the allegations must be read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, or as some courts have put it, that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the complaint should be drawn in the plaintiff's favor. That clearly is a change on the preexisting law; and it is a change with regard to the law that circuits were applying before the enactment of the Reform Act.\n Why don't we simply assume that the read most favorable to the plaintiff rule is still in place, but that reading it most favorably to the plaintiff, it must rise to the level of supporting the strong inference?\n I guess, Justice Souter, that I would wonder what it would mean to say that you read the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. If what it means is that a plaintiff can simply accumulate reasonable subsidiary inferences in order to create the strong inference of state of mind that is ultimately required, then I think I would disagree that that rule remains in effect. Precisely because our view is that in applying the strong inference standard, a court should consider other possible explanations for the defendant's conduct that are not foreclosed by the allegations  \n Well, but I was using the word inference to   to refer to some reasoning process based upon what is stated. Not on assumptions favorable to the plaintiff. And if inference is to tie   is, is a term that is tied to what is alleged, then I don't see any   any contradiction between reading those allegations most favorably, but saying the statute in each statute requires that the   that the total force of the inference rise to the level of strength that you speak of.\n I think our only concern, Justice Souter, would be that where a plaintiff includes ambiguous allegations in the complaint, a court should consider the possibility that those ambiguities work to the defendant's favor as well as working to the plaintiff's favor. And one concrete example of that in this case are the allegations that concern the Titan 5500. There are allegations in this case that there was a study and there were various internal reports that indicated that demand for that product was declining. But the complaint does not specifically allege that that study and those internal reports were even available at the time the CEO made the alleged  \n Mr. Shanmugam, could   could I get you back to   to your, your assertion of we don't have to reach in this case the question of whether the same standard applies at trial as, as at the pleading stage? It seems to me a Seventh Amendment claim has been raised. It's our usual policy to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication. If indeed the two standards are the same, there's certainly no Seventh Amendment problem. So why don't we have to first of all decide, in resolving the Seventh Amendment claim, whether the two standards are the same?\n Well, that is certainly correct, Justice Scalia, but in our view, there is no constitutional problem here. And the reason that there is no constitutional problem here is in making the probabilistic determination that is required by the Reform Act, a court is taking the allegations in the complaint as true. It is not engaging in any weighing of the evidence.\n But you're getting to the merits of the constitutional problem. And we usually run away from constitutional problems. We don't even want to consider the merits of it. And we don't have to, if indeed the two standards are the same.\n Well, to the extent that the Court views the constitutional issue in this case as sufficiently substantial to trigger the canon of constitutional avoidance, then we do believe that the better view, the view that is more consistent with Congress's intent, is that if the Court is choosing between raising the standard at the pre stage and watering down the standard at the pleadings stage, we believe that the former is more consistent with Congress's  \n Even if there is no Seventh Amendment problem, what sense would it make to have a regime that says plaintiff has to plead more than the plaintiff has to show at summary judgment or prove at trial.\n Well, Congress was concerned, Justice Alito, with the problem of abusive pleading. That much is crystal clear. And as part of that concern, Congress was concerned that plaintiffs could readily allege fraud by hindsight, and Congress may have been concerned that the plaintiff could do so not only by making a conclusory allegation of state of mind, but also making a slightly less conclusory allegation of state of mind by alleging facts that merely give rise to a reasonable inference of state of mind. If Congress hadn't had that concern, it obviously could have codified the reasonable inference standard that was then in use by a number of other courts.\n What do you think in writing this opinion? There are a couple of ways. One, you can find strong inference in terms of some other words. Two, you could look to history. Or three, you could just try an example. Say strong inference means strong inference. Here's an example. This is a complaint. It meets it, or it doesn't meet it. Which way, in your opinion, will work best in this case?\n Justice Breyer, our primary concern in this case is with the way that the Court of Appeals articulated the applicable standard, which we believe may have pernicious effects in future cases. And so we certainly believe that it would be appropriate for the Court to vacate and remand for the Court of Appeals to apply the correct standard. But just to be clear  \n You said the Court of Appeals to apply it. Could the Court of Appeals applying the standard that you say is correct come to the same decision that it came to using a different verbal formula.\n In our view, Justice Ginsburg, applying the correct standard, the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be reversed. And if the case were remanded to the Court of Appeals for application of the standard, we certainly think that the Court of Appeals should come out the other way.\n You had something else to say in answer to my question, which I would like to hear.\n I think it was just that point, Justice Breyer, namely, that if the Court believes that it would be useful to provide guidance to the lower courts by applying the standard itself in this case, we do believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed rather than vacated.\n Is the requisite standard, knowledge of falsity.\n The requisite scienter is either intent or recklessness, with regard to the underlying conduct at issue, in effect  \n Intent to make a false statement?\n Yes, that's right. And in fact, in misstatement cases, that is knowledge of falsity.\n Thank you Mr. Shanmugam. Mr. Miller.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court? We believe the Seventh Circuit had it right. We believe that what the Seventh Circuit, and this is in partial response to you, Justice Breyer, is take more or less a holistic view of the entirety of the complaint. The business about the 5500, the business about the 6500 not being available when on December 11, 2000, Notebaert says it's available, the fact that they weren't shipping it, they weren't selling it, it didn't work, and the extensive information from confidential sources that there were, as one judge once referred to it, accounting shenanigans going on, designed to shift income into the fourth quarter of 2000. We think that when the court looked at that, it said, looks to us as if there's  \n Do we take judicial notice that a CEO knows these things and that's the strong inference.\n Again, you have confidential sources in this case, and in the case, Notebaert is hands on, he's talking to people, he's on the phone all the time. We're talking about the 5500  \n But you agree you have to have that? You have to have some specific allegation to show of his knowledge? We can't just infer that?\n I would think you should be able to infer it with the CEO. I think the confidential sources demonstrate in this case, he must have had it, given his nature, the status of these products, his day-to-day  \n The most suspicious thing in the complaint that I could find was where you say there's an internal market report, and it revealed demand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would decline by 400,000,000. Then you date that with in or about early '01. Now, I think if you knew or had reason to believe that it was prior to March or April of '01, you would have said so.\n If we knew.\n Yeah, and therefore, there's quite a good chance here that this report was written after he made the statements. What am I supposed to do with that? I mean, I know what you said. And you said your best. And that's your best.\n Yes. This notion of strategic ambiguity is in a sense humorous, given the obstacles that a plaintiff has to get the goods, so to speak. Just think about the investigation efforts that went into this case. What you do, Justice Breyer, is   and I think this is what the Seventh Circuit did   look at everything, look at the fact that you have got confidential sources saying 5500 demand is drying up, perhaps as early as middle 2000. Parts are not being ordered. People are going home early. Verizon dropped 25 percent, fourth quarter. Verizon dropped 50 percent in January. You're the CEO. You don't know that your flagship product is drying up? That there's inventory, that people are going home? That your best customer doesn't know you anymore?\n You're arguing the facts and the inferences. You said the Seventh Circuit got it right. As I read their articulation of the standard on page 20A of the petition appendix, it's the normal standard that would have been applied prior to the passage of the PSLRA. Could a reasonable person infer   Congress passes a law saying they've got to give rise to a strong inference. Shouldn't that have changed the standard?\n We believe two propositions. Number one, you can't exceed the Seventh Amendment, and the Seventh Circuit  \n I don't understand the Seventh Amendment argument here. Congress can surely articulate the standard that's going to be applied as a matter of substantive law. If Congress says, you have to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that doesn't interfere with the Seventh Amendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to that standard.\n That is correct, Chief Justice. But that is not what Congress did. Congress did not elevate the burden of proof. That is why Mr. Phillips has asked you to, in effect, to overrule Huddleston.\n Well, but Congress just established an entry qualification for getting into court. And there are a lot of entry qualifications. In diversity cases, you   if you allege diversity, and it existed at the outset, that's fine. That doesn't have to be proved at the end of the case. Indeed even if you prove the contrary, the case is still validly there. Congress can establish entry requirements even when they differ from, or have indeed nothing to do with the merits that the jury is supposed to decide.\n I think that is absolutely correct, and indeed rule 9(b) has been an entry qualification since 1938. But there are entry qualifications, and there are entry qualifications. In this case, in effect, the motion to dismiss operates as a dispositive motion. It cuts off the ability to proceed at all, and it does it, if you listen to the standards being proposed by Petitioner, and by the United States  \n200,000 damages. Now, you might have been just as much hurt if you had less, but that would be constitutional. So here you can't get into Federal court unless you have a really strong claim, an overwhelming claim that you have to demonstrate at the beginning. Now, you might have a good claim, but we're not going to let you come into Federal court. We only want those people who are really strong, just as we only want those people who are really suffering.\n And did Congress raise the burden  \n No. No, not the burden of   it's the entry.\n The entry points you referred to, the so-called pleas in abatement, to put on my common law hat, a jurisdiction venue, et cetera, they may raise issues of fact and Congress, in control of the Federal courts, can calibrate it any way they want. But when you are dealing with the core function of the jury   and matters of abatement were never considered to be core functions of the jury   I think a whole range of cases starting with Slocum versus New York Life  \n I thought you told me that Congress could set a high level of burden on factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the Seventh Amendment.\n I'm distinguishing, Mr. Chief Justice, between the merits and the entry point.\n Are you saying that Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence.\n No. No. No. No. If Congress wants to change preponderance to clear and convincing, it can.\n So you would say that you could have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must be met at the pleading level, but more likely than not at the jury level?\n No. That is something I disagree with. If the substance of the law  \n We want to know what the rule is.\n I'm not sure it's the rule. It's what I would advocate. If the substance says predominance, then to raise the pleading bar on what in effect is a dispositive motion   and I don't think it makes any difference whether it's a JNOV, a directed verdict, a summary judgment, motion for judgment on the opening statement   and you decided all of those cases. And you protected what Justice Souter referred to in Markman as the core function of the jury. You have always said these procedures are okay, as long as it does not call for the resolution of fact issues, because that's the core function of the jury. Now this Court is faced with, in effect, coming back down that time line to the motion to dismiss.\n If I'm with you so far, why would you suppose that Congress would create a different standard on the motion to dismiss than they meant to apply at the merits standard?\n I don't think Congress would. I do not believe Congress ever intended   it's not in the statute, it is not in the legislative history, it is not in any case, Matsushita, Monsanto are unique antitrust cases, and in both cases, the Court, if you read the opinions fully, protected the jury function. They said there was simply nothing beyond the assertions standing alone when you have competitive and anticompetitive conduct to protect substantive antitrust law. That doesn't do it.\n Well, then what was Congress trying to do when they said strong inference? It seems to me that if you think the standards have to be the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no Seventh Amendment problem.\n What you have to show at proof is preponderance.\n Then it seems to me that you have the meaning of strong inference and reasonable inference.\n Our standard, as proposed, and we think  \n You don't want to answer yes or no there?\n   is reasonable jurors, who are finders of fact, could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants acted with scienter.\n So you're saying those words, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing as reasonable inference.\n No. You can have lots of reasonable inferences that don't meet a preponderance notion.\n That's true, but imagine a case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on both sides. And then you read that document and you conclude this is the weakest case I've ever heard, but I do think a reasonable juror could find for the plaintiff. And that would be the weak evidence standard. And lo and behold, that could be   you know, what do we do about that? Because using your do you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine cases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the weak inference and not the strong inference. And what I'm driving at is, I don't see a way of avoiding this Seventh Amendment problem.\n If  \n Because they certainly didn't intend the weak inference standard.\n If you follow petitioners in their attempt to deconstruct not simply Rule 8's construction, but hundreds of years of what this Court in Jones versus Bock referred to as usual procedural practices which are not to be lightly departed from, the historic notion is you look at the complaint and in a curious way, you have blinders on. You look at the complaint. You read it in the light favorable to the pleader. You do not weigh. That is a jury function. You do not look for exculpatory explanations.\n How can you assess the strength of the inference that can be drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint without considering all the inferences that could be drawn from those facts? I just don't understand that argument. You see somebody   let's say you saw somebody today walking east on Pennsylvania Avenue in the direction of Capitol Hill. Now you   there's   you could draw an inference that the person is coming to the Supreme Court. And if there were no other building in Washington, that would be a very strong inference. But don't you also have to consider the inference that the person is going to the Capitol, the person is going to the Library of Congress, the person is going to some other location up here? You have to consider all the inferences that you can draw from the facts.\n As the Seventh Circuit did, we agree, you look at the totality of the complaint. That's a given. But there are contrary inferences that undermine the strength of the plaintiff's inferences. They weaken it. And they're   they emanate from the complaint. There are other kinds of inferences, let's call it nonculpability, that don't denigrate the strong inference which let's assume hypothetically has been established. They're just side-bar possibilities.\n Well, let's take one specific example that the petitioners did, and that is this matter of the channel stuffing. They say here's a notion, channel stuffing. It could mean goods were shipped that nobody ever ordered, or it could mean something different. It could mean discounting and other incentives to get people to buy. So there's good channel stuffing and bad channel stuffing, and it sounds like good cholesterol, bad cholesterol; you can't tell from the allegations that it's the bad stuffing that's at issue.\n The Seventh Circuit reached that conclusion, I think, by looking at some of the confidential sources which sort of indicated that there was channel stuffing in the sense of pushing product out which was coming back. The head of Verizon complained about the channel stuffing, so there's reason to believe that at least some of it is bad. Just enough. Now, is that in and of itself determinative? No. Again, I come back to the notion that what the Seventh Circuit did is look at the 5500, look at the 6500, look at the earnings projections which proved false, looked at back-dating, channel stuffing. Looked at all of that and said okay, even if I treat channel stuffing as weak, I have these other things. And as Judge Lynch of the First Circuit said, each fact of scienter is like a brush stroke.\n Are you entitled to consider the brush strokes that are not there as well as the subsidiary brush strokes that are? In Justice Alito's example, if the pleadings don't point out that the Library of Congress and the Capitol are also up on this hill, is the judge at the motions stage entitled to consider that?\n Obviously, if it's something you can take judicial notice of, then yes.\n Okay. Then that is engaging in something more than construing the pleadings most favorably to the plaintiff.\n But it's within the realm of what courts have done for the longest of the time. They look at documents attached. They look at judicial notice.\n What do you think about that? There are at least some circumstances, then, in which there this is kind of critical assessment function that you concede must go on, rather than simply a piling favorable inference onto favorable inference to see if it gets to the strong points.\n I repeat what I said a couple of minutes ago, Justice Souter. If the negative depletes the affirmative, if there's a correlation between them, I can understand that. Maybe it eliminates that fact. Maybe it reduces that fact. But when we hear about motive, what does motive and guidance reduction months after the false statements have to do with whether the statements were false, whether the 5500 was  \n That is   that is an argument for the weight of considering motive rather than the relevance of the motive consideration per se.\n I think it is a tough line. I think this is the kind of line district judges have to draw. I think if you look at your own precedents like Anderson versus Liberty Lobby and all of those jury trial cases, you see the repetition of the notion that judges do not balance inference chains on a matter going to the core function of a jury.\n But all of those cases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to me, established a very different standard. They said they have to support a strong inference.\n A strong inference. Not a conclusive inference.\n Strong inference was not the test that was being applied in Anderson, Liberty Lobby, in any of those cases.\n But can't   but strong inference, as Justice Ginsburg said much earlier, was the standard not only in the Second Circuit but in the First Circuit and in the Third Circuit.\n What do you think about the approach   because I have had some of these cases. And I see   I think words, words, words. And what Congress said was strong inference, and we're not going to get any further by looking for some other words. So therefore, take strong inference. The most helpful thing is take it, look at the complaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong inference. Or maybe we'd say it isn't. We read it, and avoid all the other issues. What do you think about that?\n Live to fight another day?\n Right. And then on appeal, we would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes, it is a strong inference. I mean, I hope we're going to establish some standards for how you go about determining whether there's a strong inference or not.\n And I hope we're going to recognize that Congress thought it was doing something. Your argument so far, Professor, doesn't indicate that Congress  \n Excuse me.\n You indicated that the   you know, the plaintiff had to do all this investigation. The whole point of this was that the defendants were being disadvantaged.\n Look at the statute in its entirety. This isn't a statute that just deals with pleading scienter. Look at the provisions dealing with the selection of lead representative, which has produced this incredible shift from '95 to public institutions, pensions and labor unions. They don't bring frivolous cases. Look at the control that statute gives over selection of them with notice provisions to make sure you've got the  \n How does that change how we should read strong inference in the statute? Are you saying don't worry whether it's a strong inference or not because labor unions are bringing the cases and they're not going to bring a frivolous case? No. Congress said there has to be a strong inference. And what concerns me is that the very standard that the Seventh Circuit articulated said simply could a reasonable person infer. The notion of strong inference isn't in that standard at all.\n The notion of strong inference starting with the Second Circuit doctrine, as used in many other circuits, was actually a much lower standard than what we are recommending. If I believe   if I think back at Greenstone, it was reason to believe, or tends to believe, or circumstantial evidence in Greenstone and in Burlington Coat. Under our standard of preponderance, the ability to find preponderance, you are elevated. You are also elevated by the preceding subdivision which requires a level of particularization, never known in Federal Rule  \n Mr. Miller, going back just to the word strong, forgetting the particularization from it, do you think you can categorize the strength in percentage terms? They have to be more than 50 percent? More than probable cause? We're talking all abstractly here and I find it easier to think when I think about numbers.\n I have   forgive me. I haven't seen a judicial opinion that says at the 33 and one-third percentage of probability, I've got to give it to the jury, because that jury might file for my  \n I think it's 66 and two-thirds. I think that is   (Laughter.)\n Is that because you never met a plaintiff you really liked? (Laughter.)\n At least we know that in the probable world  \n I took a liberty there with the Justice. I don't think you can ascribe a percentage to it. I think  \n Well, I think more likely than not, most people think of 49, 50 percent. Can you tell us whether strong inference is stronger than more likely than not?\n I do not believe it is. I think   I think strong inference   if we're doing the numbers game   may actually be 40 percent. If a district judge is looking, again, I say at the entirety of discounts  \n Let me just reclaim the question. Is it stronger or weaker than probable cause in a criminal context?\n Oh, I would hope it's stronger. I would hope it's higher than probable cause.\n What about clear and convincing? Is it below clear   I mean, they are the only two standards I actually understand. Without picking a number out of air, is preponderance, I think I can figure that out. And I guess I can figure out beyond a reasonable doubt. But other than those, when you talking about strong, when you talk about clear and convincing, I have no idea what those things mean. Do you?\n And  \n You don't think they mean anything?\n No, I think they mean what a district judge honoring his Article III commission concludes after an intensive evaluation of the entirety of the complaint, looking for that strong inference, putting on his sort of motion to dismiss 12(b)(6) hat, says okay  \n Just okay?\n No, I did not mean that. Don't take me literally on that. For heavens sakes, I'm from Brooklyn. I'm very colloquial. I'm very sorry about that.\n Let me write that down. We should not take you literally. All right. (Laughter.)\n Okay, you two are even now. (Laughter.)\n Understand, you keep asking, quite properly obviously, how does strong inference change anything? The test we have proposed and the test I believe the Seventh Circuit applied is not the classic 12(b)(6) have you stated a claim, because we all know at least traditionally, under notice pleading, you can march through that. This test, if you follow that time line backward, is in effect asking that district judge to make a decision on looking at the totality of this complaint, is this case trial worthy? It's a curious thing. I don't envy district judges who have to do this. Is it trial worthy? Why would Congress say, if a district judge is willing to say under the classic test, I think it's trial worthy, there's no reason to believe that Congress wanted to cut that case off.\n Trial worthy under preponderance standard or trial worthy under the strong inference standard?\n Oh, I think he is becoming slightly schizoid, he is saying, I'm looking at strong inference. I'm looking at the motion to dismiss structure as it's been, the usual procedure, 200 years, and I have to make a judgment because Congress was pushing here. There's no doubt about it. I have to make a decision on the basis of what I've got, which is virtually nothing   let's face that   I think   I think if these allegations are proven, it is certainly trial worthy.\n It sounds to me like  \n It's not trial worthy, but rather discovery worthy.\n I'm sorry. Justice Stevens, say it again.\n I think the question is not whether it's trial worthy, it's whether it's worthy for discovery. That's really what's at issue in this.\n Well, the realities out there are they built a wall. They put in all of these procedural protections and they said no discovery until you climb the wall. Now what kind of a wall was it? Was it a Dutch dike or the Berlin Wall? If you look at that statute, contrary to what Mr. Phillips urges, there are multiple policies expressed in that statute, one of which is, private cases are good. Let's just get the right people to run those private cases. Let's control them. Let's, let's have a greater threshold, but let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. Because everybody seems to agree private cases help.\n I want, I want to be fair. I interpreted your argument   and please tell me if this is incorrect   as indicating that if I think strong inference is greater, more onerous than more likely than not, at the pleading stage, I then also have to say this is the instruction that must be given to the jury? In order to avoid the, the discontinuity between the pleading stage and what  \n The way you state it, Justice, is something very hard for me to respond to. Congress did not change the persuasiveness, the proof burden. If you go through the statute, you will see spots where they did. Congress knew how to change proof standards. Congress knew how to change Federal rules. Congress did not change the proof in private actions. Congress did not change all of the background procedure like the background procedure in Jones and   it is just not there yet. Congress did change a couple of Federal rules explicitly. So I, I cannot comprehend how, if the case reached the jury, you would have to charge above predominance. And I, I think we've got a stone rolling downhill to the dismissal point, which is why we have urged in the brief and why the Seventh Circuit was concerned as was the Sixth about this jury trial implication  \n Yeah, and so I think we have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if imported into the pleading would always mean a strong inference. You see, that's   that's the dilemma. And I don't see how to remain true to the words of the statute which are strong inference, without actually producing a dichotomy. And so either Congress can do it or it can't, and   and   and that's   and we could fudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment. But I don't  \n Mr. Miller, suppose Congress set up a entirely separate cause of action. It's caused   it's called a discovery cause of action, okay? And it sets forth as the condition for pursuing that cause of action a standard that your, your allegation has to be indeed clear and convincing. Okay? And then if you win that, you can take whatever you get out of the discovery and bring a lawsuit. Would that be unconstitutional?\n Why do I feel wind whipping past my ears as I go through a trap door? (Laughter.)\n Ironically, ironically, I think I have to say if Congress, leaving to one side justiciability problems with the discovery cause of action, if Congress created a discovery cause of action it could ascribe to it whatever incidents it wanted to  \n Surely it could prohibit discovery altogether which it did before they adopt in 1938.\n That is correct. And I don't think anybody seriously argues that discovery is a constitutional right. The jury trial implications of this new cause of action are interesting. This Court has protected post-1791 statutory claims and their right to jury trial, but you're positing one that wasn't known in 1791, and maybe it could be done without a jury. That's really a hypothetical.\n Thank you, Mr. Miller. Mr. Phillips, you have four minutes remaining.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have to confess I'm   I'm slightly perplexed by exactly what the Respondent's position is in this case so I'm inclined to kind of go back to the core points that have been raised by the questions from   from the Court. And in the first instance, it seems to me quite clear that the Seventh Circuit did not apply the strong inference standard. If   you can compare the language from the First Circuit circuit that specifically says it has to be reasonable and strong, strong has completely fallen out here. I don't see any way to read it the other way. I think in response to Justice Breyer's question, which is how do, how should you write the opinion, I think the meaningful way to write the opinion is to be respectful of Justice Scalia's desire to provide guidance. So I do think you should say, you have to, as Justice Alito said, review the entirety of the document and   and infer both positively and negatively as you go forward. We know that has to be true. Almost every court that's dealt with these issues  \n But then you're doing away with reading the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n Absolutely. Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. There's no question that that's   that that's what Congress had to have meant under these circumstances. And the best example of that is the CEO who sells securities during the time period of the class action. There are dozens of cases in which that happens. Does it create an inference of scienter? It might, because it's quite possible that he sold and   he lied about the stock in order to keep the price up to sell. It is also possible that he sells only about 1 percent of the stock  \n But Mr. Phillips, you don't look at these things one at a time. You look at them altogether.\n Well, that is  \n Is the statute all you had?\n Justice Ginsburg, I couldn't disagree with you more about that. That is precisely what Congress says when   when it says with particularity. And when Congress says you have to look at each defendant. You cannot do  \n It says you must plead the facts with particularity.\n Yes.\n But when one judges the adequacy of the complaint, one looks at all the facts pleaded with particularity, not just one.\n But the strong inference of scienter is not pled on a group basis. It has to be pled with respect to each individual defendant. So it's quite convenient  \n Well, I think that this case was a good example. There were two defendants and the court of appeals  \n Well, there were a lot more than that.\n Well, to take the two that were at issue in this opinion. The court of appeals said the CEO, yeah, there's enough there to get over that threshold. The other guy, no, there wasn't. So it's not that she's saying what you find for one, you find for all. She is going at it defendant by defendant.\n Well, I   I   I mean, I was commenting primarily on Professor Miller's decision to just sort of sweep everything in and say look, back in 1999 and 2000 when the Seventh Circuit itself specifically said that the knowledge, for instance, of the 5500 decline didn't happen until March of 2001. So I was just saying you can't start sweeping everything in. But   and it is true, the court distinguished between those two individuals; but the bottom line remains the same. You have to analyze them, each. And you have to take into account contending inferences. You have to construe ambiguity contrary to the plaintiff sometimes  \n What do you do with a report that you know exists because you had one of these 26 confidential people tell you? But you haven't seen the report, so you don't have the date on it? And you won't know that date unless you have access to discovery. Do you have to assume the date is later rather than sooner?\n I think you better make an allegation with particularity that that date was at a time when the individual would know that the   that the information that he was conveying was   was wrong. I don't see how you can infer strongly  \n But you   if the plaintiff  \n   scienter otherwise.\n The plaintiff can't know for sure without seeing the document with a date on it.\n Well, the plaintiff can ask the confidential informant as much as, as he wants about the information; and if he can't come up with it, that's the price you pay. That was exactly what Congress said, is if you cannot make those particular allegations, then you're out of luck. And it's not as though they give you one shot for this.\n Congress   Congress used words, \"strong inference.\" Those words are not self-defining. One can think of several ways, in fact the courts of appeals did think of several ways. Why should we pick your way as opposed to the other ways one might define them?\n I could be flip to say it's the right way. But I think the   I mean the answer to the, the answer to why to choose our approach is because it is consistent with Matsushita and Monsanto and it will allow, Justice Breyer, to apply it in an individualized way, in a fashion that will give guidance to the lower courts. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The per se illegality rule for resale price maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated, misguided and anticompetitive. It should be replaced with the same rule of reason standard that applies to other forms of vertically imposed marketing restrictions. The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a restraint is unreasonable. Per se rules should be rare and imposed only where the court is virtually certain based upon considerable economic experience that a practice is nearly invariably anticompetitive. Vertical minimum retail   resale price maintenance are plainly not invariably anticompetitive. In fact, a broad consensus of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that vertical restraints promote interbrand competition, which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely, if ever, anticompetitive.\n There was an argument made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves, in which case some might have held back.\n Well, the economists who have looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case. It certainly could not be the case in this industry in connection with this participant in the marketplace. There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton products are sold through. There are thousands and thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of products. What the Court has said repeatedly is that programs such as this may promote interbrand competition, perhaps  \n Mr. Olson, suppose just the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among themselves on the price. Would that be lawful?\n No. I think that that would be covered by a horizontal prohibition, Justice Stevens.\n Would you say that it's per se unlawful?\n I think it would be, as horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was   if it was   involved the manufacturer in some way, it could be dealt with by the rule of reason.\n Why should that be any different from the arrangement where those dealers all got together in the convention and recommended to the manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of precisely the same dimensions? Why  \n What this Court said in Sylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan, is that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive to increase  \n No, but I'm asking what if he did, why should you draw a distinction?\n Because the motivation for the arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer   you're suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in a particular area would get together to impose this on a manufacturer. I think it's very unrealistic that that would happen.\n No. They just passed a resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this vertical restraint and ways to do it. Should that be different from one in which the manufacturer does it independently?\n I think that if the manufacturer makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of course relationships between the dealers and the manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in doing this, because they may find for the same reason that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of products. The record is clear in this case that this was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly competitive marketplace, and it was successful.\n Maybe, Mr. Olson, you could give us an example where the rule of reason would find a violation in this situation?\n Well, it might be a situation, the economists have written about this, say that it would be very rare, and would require retailers with a strong powerful market power to impose a situation where the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a horizontal cartel. That certainly was not involved in this case, and that would probably be found to violate the rule of reason. In addition, it would probably be unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this Court. That was not an issue in this case. The economists say that that would very seldom happen.\n200 million to get rid of it. And his conclusion is, as in the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits. Massive.\n Well  \n What that sounds like is that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more for the goods that they buy at retail. Now that's one economist, of course. There are other whose think differently. So how should we decide this?\n Well  \n Should we overturn Dr. Miles and run that risk?\n In, in the vast majority of the economist whose have looked at this have come out to the opposite conclusion, Justice Breyer. Secondly  \n We're supposed to count economists?\n No. No. I think that  \n Is that how we decide it? (Laughter.)\n But what this Court   what this Court has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such as this where there's a consensus among leading respected economists, that is one factor. There's another factor  \n Well, I haven't seen a consensus. A consensus? Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?\n This is one factor that the Court should consider and the Court has considered in the past when dealing with something that the Court itself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically schizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain vertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with respect to other vertical restraints. The Court   the Court itself has made those pronouncements. The enforcing agencies have changed their view with respect   and they are here today, the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, all of whom have announced that they believe that it is very rare for a rule such as this, for an arrangement such as this to be anticompetitive.\n But it was not so long ago that the Department of Justice took a different view. And of all of the vertical restraints, this is the only one where Congress has been a player. I mean, Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate. And then it withdrew that. There's no other restraint where they are has been congressional action, where the argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if they so will.\n Essentially, the same argument was made in the Sylvania   at the time of the Sylvania case. The same argument was made just a term or two go in connection with the Illinois Tool case that dealt with tying arrangements. The same argument was made in State Oil versus Khan. This Court has construed the antitrust laws as an expression by Congress that the courts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the marketplace  \n But in those cases you didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and McGuire. That's what makes this   this one different in terms of congressional intention.\n The repeal of those statutes, Justice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules. It was not a congressional expression against the rule of reason  \n No, but there was in the patent case, though, Mr. Olson. We relied on the fact that the patent law changed.\n Yes, you did.\n Yes.\n And that was a, that was one factor, however, Justice Stevens. I think, as I read that opinion, the Court was also concerned with the fact that the, the per se rule which   and the Court said the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the Weyerhaeuser case   to the extent there's practices that can be procompetitive, the Court should not set a low threshold of illegality, especially low per se illegality threshold. There were   there have been   it is worth emphasizing that the Court has repeatedly said we don't want per se rules when we don't have a substantial body of economic experience that shows us that this practice  \n What about   what about the reliance interest, though? I mean, hasn't a whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance on the Dr. Miles rule? And don't we need to be concerned about the disruption to that established practice?\n There's really no evidence that the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the Dr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice  \n Isn't there evidence that the, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the Targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade? So   that there's that correlation.\n Actually I looked into that, Justice Souter. And me, my limited historical research is that the   those discounters were coming on strong before 1975 which is when the, the consumer price, whatever it was, act was passed in response to that. There are   the evidence basically shows that   and this Court has said   that it's interbrand competition that ultimately produces lower prices.\n Well, I don't know. We have   you talked about   just for fun I got out of the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called resale price maintenance where he has five economists   now maybe you're not going to count them as economists. Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief as single argument that isn't in the book. There's one interesting thing about the book. It was written in 1966. So I guess my question is what's changed? Now I know two things have changed. One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain, and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices went down. That's changed. And the second thing that's changed is there's far more concentration, I gather, today in the retail side of the market than there are used to be, a factor which makes resale price maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take place at the request of the dealers. Now, I see those two changes. My question to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even on Google, and   what's changed? What's new?\n Well, a number of things have changed. The   the number of respected individuals, notwithstanding that book, who have looked at it and have focused on the marketplace, have said that because it allows   it increases the possibility of interbrand competition, it can provide incentives for dealers to provide service, differences in the products. And other things that have happened since then, are this Court's decision in the Sylvania case, which   which involved an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the ruling   the reason for a per se rule. This Court's decision in State Oil versus Khan, and the other cases that this Court is very well aware of where per se rules have systematically been dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the marketplace. This  \n Mr. Olson, does brand competition generally help retailers, or is this a question that can't be answered?\n Did you say inter  \n Interbrand, interbrand competition? Do retailers like interbrand competition?\n Well, I don't know that   I don't know whether people like competition. But the antitrust laws like competition and this Court likes competition. And this Court has said that interbrand  \n Well, but we're talking about inter   we're talking about retailers. It, it seems to me at the outset of the argument, you   you acknowledged, and I think it is the general rule   that if the retailers themselves have this resale price maintenance, it is invalid. Well, if the manufacturer does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and that's   many of the examples in your brief, it is for the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers, then why shouldn't there be a per se rule? Why should we allow the manufacturer to do something we that wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the retailers?\n Well, the manufacturer is very unlikely to do this for the convenience of the retailers, to   because it's in the interest of the manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the manufacturers' products as possible.\n If   if, if indeed that's, that's what he's aiming at, low price. Is it the object of the   is the sole object of the Sherman Act to produce low prices?\n No.\n I thought it was consumer welfare.\n Yes, yes, it is.\n And I thought some consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.\n Precisely.\n So the mere fact that it would increase prices doesn't prove anything. It doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare. If, in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive products at a lower price, wouldn't it?\n That's   that's absolutely correct.\n So I don't know why, why we should have to focus our entire attention on whether it's going to   going to produce higher prices or not. The market out there has different goods at different prices which have different qualities that attract different consumers.\n I   I agree completely. I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has said over and over again. If you   the purpose of the antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition, because competition between competing manufacturers give the consumers more choice. Some people may want the cheapest product. Some people may want the product that's more available to them. They may wish the return policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that the dealer provides. And in this marketplace particularly, that system of providing competition is consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced success in the marketplace.\n Mr. Olson, before you sit down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to discount. And if that were true, as a matter of fact, then that would be a   a plain violation of antitrust law, wouldn't it?\n This   but the case was never litigated on that basis. It wasn't considered on that basis in the Court of Appeals. It came up sort of as a late thought in the opposition to the petition for certiorari. But that is not this case. The case was litigated on the per se rule of Dr. Miles.\n Thank you, Mr. Olson.\n   in the complaint,.\n Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Hungar?\n Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The same considerations that led this Court in Sylvania and State Oil to reject outmoded per se rules compel that same result here. The Dr. Miles rule conflicts with this Court's modern antitrust jurisprudence in three fatal  \n Maybe I'll put my question, which is really just one for this. I understand perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing differ things. Of course, resale price maintenance does raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive. Of course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that might help consumers. Now, in addition, you need clear rules. Now those three sets of things require a balance. And we have a hundred years of history where this Court and Congress and others have balanced those three sets of considerations, and they've come out one way. Now, the Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come out the other way. There are good arguments on both sides. Why should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the absence of any   any   congressional indication that that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a difficult area of people reaching a slightly different weight on some these three sets of things?\n Several reasons, Your Honor. It's not   it's not a close question whether this Court under its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial matter would impose a per se rule in this context. There is economic   there is consensus among the respected economists  \n I would think it is quite a close question.\n I don't think you, Your Honor. Given that  \n All right, even so. Go ahead.\n Given that this Court's test, the question this Court's modern cases ask, in distinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se rule, is whether the challenged conduct is always or almost always anticompetitive. That's what the Court has said.\n Price fixing, horizontal, I guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn those too.\n Certainly not, Your Honor. Because that, that is almost always anticompetitive in our experience and in the experience of the courts. But the same is not true in the resale price maintenance context. Dr. Miles has foreclosed the courts from conducting the kind of analysis that would actually look into this question. But the empirical data that are available would suggest that anticompetitive explanations for resale price maintenance do not have very much explanatory power. When you actually look at the cases that have been litigated, they involve manufacturers without market power, unconcentrated markets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases of any cartelization going on. So the anticompetitive explanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do not appear to explain most of the retail price maintenance that has been litigated. It's true that retail price maintenance can but does not always result in price increases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out, price is not the only thing that consumers care about. And there is widespread consensus in the economic literature and in this Court's recent cases that price-based vertical restraints, just like non-price based vertical restraints, while they generally reduce intrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand competition. In Monsanto and Business Electronics, this Court made clear that price vertical restraints, like minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in fact usually, have the same or similar effects to the non-price vertical restraints to which this Court now applies rule of reason analysis. So the reason in  \n Wouldn't your argument also apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in this product just to fix prices? Because there's plenty of interbrand competition, I think. I don't think you can say it's absolutely clear that that would always be anti-competitive because they would also agree to provide additional services.\n No, Your Honor, because horizontal   the important thing to keep in mind is that the incentive of the manufacturer when the manufacturer  \n I'm talking about a case in which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide extra services at higher prices as their method of better serving the public and they all agree that they have to be conscious about the competition from other brands. Why can we be absolutely certain that's always going to be harmful to the consumer?\n Your Honor, the reason why we know that is always or almost always harmful is that the incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel, just like the incentives of the participants in a manufacturing cartel  \n They might be precisely the statement as the manufacturers: We think we'll make more, all make more money if we concentrate on service rather than price.\n No, Your Honor, because the manufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits of the retailers, but the retailers when they get together obviously have a very different incentive, which is not to benefit the manufacturer.\n What you say is right. What you say there is right. I feel I'm back in 1966. The argument against that is, we don't know which way the push comes. The large retailers, Home Depot, whatever they are, huge retailers, they want   or maybe it isn't the discounters, it's some other once. We don't know which way. You're throwing it into court. You're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not work this thing out. So the argument against what you're saying is not logic. It's empirical and administrative.\n Your Honor  \n That's what it was. That's what it is now, I guess.\n Your Honor, in State Oil the same argument was made. The argument was made that, while we don't have compelling empirical evidence that Albrecht results in harm to the economy, we don't have compelling empirical evidence that resale price maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, is generally pro-competitive, and in the absence of such empirical evidence there's no basis for overturning precedent. This Court unanimously  \n We do have empirical evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this case is going to be very significant in the sort of battle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and why should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to Congress, which is in a position to know more about where the shot is going to land than we are?\n This Court   I'm sorry. There's no empirical evidence that I'm aware of about what impact eliminating Dr. Miles would have on the Wal-Marts of the world.\n That's my point. But it seems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence that the success of the Wal-Marts and the Targets and the Home Depots was a success which was correlated with the elimination of price maintenance by the States.\n I don't think so, Your Honor. In fact, as Mr. Olson pointed out, the K-Marts of the world began during the fair trade era.\n They began, but they have flourished in the post-fair trade era.\n Yes, Your Honor, but I think considerations likes the opening up of international trade and the development of markets like China to supply low-cost goods have a lot more to do with the success of the Wal-Marts of the world than a rule like Dr. Miles. Remember, it's perfectly legal under current law for manufacturers to impose the same sort of constraints as long as they do it by fiat and unilateral enforcement rather than by agreement. So the suggestion that somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy if Dr. Miles is overruled is simply unsupportable.\n Well then, what's the great benefit then in changing the rule if it's perfectly legal to achieve the same result already?\n As the Ping amicus brief, the Ping Golf Club Manufacturer amicus brief, indicates it's extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the Colgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy like Leegin it's more efficient to do it in many circumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without further discussion for discounting one item in order to keep your policy in place.\n But doesn't that answer your argument that there isn't reason to believe that there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes, because now it's going to be easy?\n Your Honor, in 1945 during the height of the fair trade era the FTC did a study which concluded only about 5 percent of the economy was affected by fair trade. And the fair trade regime, remember, is a different and more extreme regime. There it was per se legality, not rule of reason. So it's just   there's just no basis for these assertions that somehow the economy is going to be massively changed. But it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance. It will enhance its ability to compete and it will provide consumers more of what they want, and that is a good thing and the antitrust laws should not automatically foreclose that merely because in a small percentage of cases it is conceivable that there can be anticompetitive effects.\n Isn't it fair to say that there is reason to believe that there may be a massive reorientation in the retail economy if Dr. Miles goes? And that gets to my problem, why should we be the people to make a guess as opposed to the Congress as the institution to make the guess?\n I'm not aware of any reason to believe that, Your Honor, based on the historical record and based on the modern realities. The Wal-Marts of the world have succeeded because of their discounting strategy. That's not going to change, and manufacturers have an incentive to have their goods sold through those stores and that's not going to change either in the vast majority of cases. And With respect  \n If the rule of reason is the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly, from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be   this case would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never get to trial. How do you think the rule of reason would operate if it were the rubric under which this case were to be decided?\n Your Honor, I think it would operate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would be required to establish an anticompetitive effect resulting from the challenged conduct, and once that burden is overcome the defendant would be required to come up with some legitimate business justification, some pro-competitive results that outweigh that. And only if they could do that would they succeed.\n Well, that's the formula, but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that the plaintiff could never get across the first threshold?\n We don't agree with that, Your Honor. In cases where resale price maintenance is being used to facilitate cartelization, either at the manufacturer or the retail level, the plaintiff could prevail. Also in, for example, in an oligopolistic market.\n But in this case, this case has none of those features.\n Well, right.\n Leegin loses under the rule of reason, right?\n We don't know that. It seems likely to assume that, though, and that's not a bad thing. Leegin is obviously not dominant in the market. It's obviously not going to succeed unless what it is offering at a higher price is what consumers want, and that is a good thing under the antitrust laws.\n Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Coykendall.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As recently as last month, this Court restated a guiding principle of antitrust jurisprudence: Discouraging price cuts and depriving consumers of low prices is bad antitrust policy. RPM prohibits price  \n Is that right? I mean, You really think that antitrust policy means when   any arrangement that produce a higher price is bad?\n Well, we aren't talking about any arrangement  \n I mean, a lot of consumers want, you know, extended warranties. They want show rooms where they can go and look at things. All of which costs more money. And where you can not have resale price maintenance the customers   or you have the free rider problem. The customers shop at the place that has the big show room, likes at all the product there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has not incurred that expense. Now, I just don't think that all the customers want is cheap. I think they want other things besides cheap. I think they want service. I think they want selection. I think they want the ability to view goods and so forth. Why do you discount all of those things?\n I don't discount all those things. All those things are available under our current regime where we have a per se prohibition against resale price maintenance.\n Well, they aren't available. This company thought that it could provide higher service if it could assure its retailers that they would not be undercut by people who are not providing that kind of service.\n And there's no question that even the plaintiff in this case was providing that service. He was providing it more efficiently and he just wanted to pass those efficiencies on.\n I don't, I don't know that there's no question about that. There's certainly no question that this company was successful in breaking into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the service.\n The record shows that with this specific company, most of the growth of its sales occurred before it established a resale price maintenance policy. So there are no demonstrated benefits from this company of imposing and enforcing a resale price maintenance policy.\n What is your main objection to   I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of reason. Why, why can't the rule of reason work to promote the objectives you've just articulated?\n Well, as a practical matter for someone in my position, or plaintiff's position, it's impossible for a small dealer to muster the resources in order to put forth   CHIEF JUSTICE\n For a small dealer. But as we've already heard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are prices like Target and Wal-Mart. Those aren't small dealers. Those are behemoths in the retailing industry.\n I would suggest that those are not the people that really are being protected by this particular per se prohibition. It is the small mom and pop operation like my client that wants to innovate and expand and pass on efficiencies and compete with the big discounters who might have power of their own in order to secure discounts.\n So you don't agree with the argument that we've heard this morning that the transformation of American retailing since the 1970s and the rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and that overruling Dr. Miles would reverse that?\n No, I absolutely agree with that. But it's resale price maintenance that enables these initiators, these small companies, these small operations, to grow and innovate, achieve the efficiencies, and pass those on, attract customers by reducing prices. And all that is stopped by imposition of a resale price  \n Is there anything to suggest that the large-scale low-price retailers who were supposedly dependent on Dr. Miles are   support its retention? Have they filed amicus briefs here or otherwise suggested that this is essential to their continuing operation?\n Again, the large-scale dominant players in the retail industry have their own market power. They don't need the protection of the per se rule in order to enforce them. It's the next generation that this rule really aims to protect.\n I don't understand that. I mean, if it was really the case that they were going to be losing, losing profits, I think they would have been here. I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the Targets. They're not here on amicus briefs because they're   what they're selling is cheap. They are selling price, and people who want low price and for whom that's of value above all other things are going to continue to go to those stores. So they're not going to be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to provide not just the low price   of course, they'll try to keep the price as low as possible   but service. I just don't see what, what harm can possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance, from allowing some people to make their money on service and   rather than cheap price.\n Well, again I would suggest that under this current system the way it is we have both the full service providers of complete service that offer goods at a certain price and we have discounters selling those same goods. There is currently a mix of service and price that better serves the economy than just having one cookie cutter   a one size fits all approach that you would have with resale price maintenance.\n Well, I thought the per se rule was the cookie cutter approach.\n Well, in terms of prohibiting price or in terms of, yes, prohibiting price fixing, that's true. But it permits stores to have full price and full service and charge high prices for that service, and it permits discounters to reduce price, reduce service and cater to those customers who want the goods with lower service.\n The Internet   is it   you would have said four years ago, or I think we are in this argument, you would have said that it's the large discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of the world who want to get rid of retail price maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops. Okay. They're in now, they're big, and they may want to maintain resale prices because they may want to extract the other profit, while the Internet little company comes in and says I can get it to you cheaper. Now I can imagine circumstances like you say. I can imagine they're not like you say. I don't know. And so what should I do if I really don't know?\n Well, there is no doubt that resale price maintenance raises prices to consumers. The only economic doubt is whether there are any redeeming effects of those prices; and that's where the economic dispute of this is.\n Well, I thought the Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that it made, the prices may be   resale price   the current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where something other than price is important, and they have to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.\n Well, Your Honor, I would suggest that, first of all, eliminating the per se rule would not decrease the inefficiencies of the Colgate doctrine. If they want to impose resale price maintenance in order to avoid even a rule of reasoned approach, they would have to go  \n Even with the tremendous anomaly that the employer   that the   the manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that won't go along? Those two are substitute of each other. Colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have to do it on your own, and then you have to do the draconian thing of terminating the dealer.\n I believe that anomaly really lies at the heart of the Sherman Antitrust Act which is aimed at contracts, combinations and conspiracies. Unilateral conduct isn't reached by that, it's the price of being in a fair country. People can deal in ways that they want to with this particular issue. But again, eliminating the per se rule will not help Ping out if they want to maintain their retail price maintenance as legal, as unilateral. They'll still have to go through these same machinations.\n Why is that? Why can't   eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point was they would just put in their contracts, you have to sell it at this price, and they could enforce the contracts, rather than having to have these machinations of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an agreement with their retailers.\n Well, again, then they would be subject to a rule of reason analysis and the uncertainties occasioned with that as to whether this contract is lawful. If they want to avoid that, then of course, they would have to stick with the Colgate doctrine. Your Honor, this particular case, we have clear evidence that RPM was used to facilitate a horizontal retailer cartel. We have evidence in the briefs that Leegin would gather its dealers in a dealer meeting, discuss the policy, agree to changes, and reach a consensus, and then enforce that policy against everyone. One of the evils of resale price maintenance is specifically this: It does facilitate the formation of cartels.\n Yeah, but the conspiracy that it facilitated was just with intrabrand competition. There wasn't conspiracy that affected interbrand competition.\n Retail  \n So I'm not sure that economically it makes any difference whether the dealers are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was, or they all did it at the same time.\n Horizontal conspiracies, even among a single brand, has always been a per se violation of the antitrust law. You can look back at the  \n No, but if we say the rule or reason should apply to all cases that just affect intrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that only affect intrabrand competition.\n There you're striking really at the heart of the   the heart of the Sherman Act, et al., holding that horizontal conspiracies, which nobody believes promote competition, could be justified under the same thinking.\n No, but it's a totally   I cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers could ever produce consumer welfare. It will be a horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to give the retailer as much   more money than the retailer is now making. He's going to try to keep their margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell as many of his products as possible consistent with his desire to sell his product by attaching to it more service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever. You know, horizontal conspiracy, the incentives are entirely different. When you're dealing with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is still to keep the price as low as possible consistent with the additional good that he wants to give consumers to attract those consumers to his product.\n In this particular case there is a complete alignment of incentives, because the manufacturer was also a retailer competing in this market. He has the incentive to increase retailer profits.\n Well, if that's the case and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would allow you to make that argument. But you   but you want to say it's bad across the board for everybody. If indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the rule of reason would allow you to argue that.\n Well, Your Honor, we would suggest that the horizontal conspiracy between Leegin as a retailer and the other retailers offering his products is more than just a rule of reason approach. That would be per se illegal under this Court's precedents. Retail price maintenance also has the problem we discussed earlier of perpetuating incumbent forms of distribution at the expense of the innovative and more efficient distribution means. Retailers, in retail competition matters, retailers should be entitled to innovate, pass efficiencies along to customers in the form of lower prices, attract new customers, and grow in that manner.\n Mr. Coykendall, the   on the question   you alleged in the complaint that there was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce it, Leegin?\n Leegin.\n Leegin. And Mr. Olson says that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct?\n That particular aspect was referred to; it wasn't pursued as a separate part of this. Prior to trial, the judge did rule that the Dr. Miles line of cases applied and the conduct would be judged under the per se rule. So certain aspects with respect to the horizontal conspiracy and the differences in discounts   I mean, developed that much.\n Suppose you were to lose, you would still have that claim, I take it?\n Well, yes. We would suggest the record is sufficient that on remand the instruction given the jury as to the standard by which their conduct could be judged could be sustained as a per se violation under the rules related to horizontal conspiracies as well. And again, I would suggest that perhaps if the Court doesn't reach that, it should remand to the Fifth Circuit for them to consider whether that is a possibility. Resale price maintenance can distort consumer choice. The retailers   so the person comes into the store   the retailers can exercise pressure to influence the selection of higher margin products over ones that may better fit the consumer needs. That is an evil of resale price maintenance, whether or not it does promote efficiencies. And if resale price maintenance does act as it is theorized, to increase retailer services, some consumers will be worse off, they'll be paying for services they don't want. There are alternatives to RPM.\n I don't suppose there's any   I don't suppose there's any way to protect against the fallout to the consumer, is there? I mean if indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a product that's more expensive than what he needs or   and what he wants, is this a real argument against this, that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned? I mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the situation.\n Well, if   what you're doing is you're building in this high margin that gives the retailer an incentive to do that. If there is no resale price maintenance so that margin isn't guaranteed, the incentive disappears. What is clear is that retail   resale price maintenance is a blunt instrument to achieve any economies.\n You're assuming that the   that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale price good. Why do you assume that?\n That's the only incentive, the only reason for imposing resale prices\n He's only going to be given the thing if he does the kind of additional service that the manufacturer wants. That's the whole purpose of it. And the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin just as low as he can consistent with the   you know   consistent with selling as many products as he can.\n Well, there are more efficient ways than RPM to achieve any benefits of efficiency, such as contracts with the retailers to provide those additional demand creating services. He could pay the retailers to provide those services. He could provide those services directly, I would suggest.\n Why would you argue that those are more efficient than resale price maintenance?\n The resale price maintenance amounts to nothing more than throwing money at the problem. You're guaranteeing a margin and you're hoping that it's going to be used somehow for the consumer's benefit, and you've got no guarantee that any dealer is going to use the margin that they're guaranteed in any way to service the consumers. And I would suggest that in geographically isolated areas  \n Well, you can add the contractual provisions you were talking about to a contract that has a minimum resale price. The minimum resale price is to take away the incentive from the retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.\n If you have a contract requiring those services, you don't need the minimum resale price. That's just completely unnecessary. And that would prohibit the efficient dealer from passing on those efficiencies to its consumers.\n Does that presume a contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for the service?\n It could be. It may not.\n If not, I don't see how that would work under your rule.\n Well, under   the idea is the manufacturer chooses to deal with only those dealers that offer this particular service. They sign a contract to provide that service. If they don't want to provide that service, they don't sign the contract, these don't get the goods. It's as simple as that. If the question is providing a larger margin to the dealer, the most efficient way is for the manufacturer simply to lower their wholesale price, and the margin the dealer receives is higher. Again, if there are other efficiencies, they might be achieved by exclusive territories as permitted by Sylvania or by the Colgate doctrine. I would suggest the experience of the 30 years following the elimination of the fair trade laws have shown the wisdom of the Dr. Miles decision which places faith in the free market system. This Court should continue to honor its precedents and respect the will of Congress by adhering to the Dr. Miles rule.\n Your reference to the will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation that supports the result you seek.\n Your Honor, as this Court observed in Sylvania, Congress by repealing the Miller-Tydings McGuire Act did indicate its support for the per se rule. I believe the Court should adhere to that holding as well.\n Thank you, counsel. Ms. Underwood?\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a manufacturer agrees with its retailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point of the agreement is to prevent price competition among retailers, to prevent discounts. For almost 100 years the Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act to prohibit such price fixing agreements. Any change in that fundamental understanding of the statute should be made by Congress and not by this Court. The per se rule against resale price maintenance is different in at least three ways from other antitrust rules that this Court has overturned. First, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled law for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by this Court.\n Well, it's also been settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more inefficiently. Doesn't it make sense to allow them to adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already completely legal?\n No. That tension that you   that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a result of the fact that the antitrust rule   law does not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior. It prohibits agreements that are anti   that restrain competition. And so it will often be the case that it is possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that line because of a different value, a value in preserving the independent action of individuals. It is, however  \n I'm not sure it's often the case. Give me some other examples where you can achieve the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.\n Well, as you have observed, virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing function and become one entity instead of two entities. Then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates the whole function, is   can fix prices, fix his, what are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of the antitrust laws. There are other reasons why a manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid the prohibitions of the antitrust law. It is also   so, this is old and well settled. Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it was established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years after it was established, this has a much more settled pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up around it. Second, it was endorsed and relied on by Congress, not enacted by Congress but endorsed and relied on by Congress, when Congress repealed the fair trade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this Court is now asked to interpret.\n Were they relying on Dr. Miles or were they relying on us? That's the question.\n They were relying  \n They left the situation where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as determined by this Court, and we had shown our willingness to update the antitrust law when sound economic doctrine suggests is necessary.\n No. The legislative history described in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's brief shows that actually they were returning the law to the per se rule against resale price maintenance because they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should be prohibited. This is   it is also true that  \n But of course, they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear. They didn't do that here.\n That's true, they did not do that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has established in the antitrust area, this rule has received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn the rule should be at its peek as compared with those other rules. And third, price is different. This Court has said that price competition is the central nervous system of the economy. Other restraints, to be sure, might indirectly affect price, but not with the same absolute force. Territorial restraints don't absolutely prevent price competition because customers can travel or order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under territorial restraints there are often multiple retailers in a particular territory who can compete. Maximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at all unless, as the Court noted in Khan, it's really Minimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which case the Court in Khan said it's illegal. Manufacturers can of course pay retailers for the services that enhance the product that are being advanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price maintenance. But the question for this Court is whether the manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing agreement to make that payment to buy those services, and that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide in a rule of reason trial. That's a question of statutory interpretation for this Court. It's a question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer can use to buy those retailer services. It's also true that the claim that price-fixing works to induce those services is both debatable and untested. The retailers have no obligations to provide services under the retail price maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other cases.\n But they could. I mean, you could easily write the agreement saying you have to charge this much and because you have to charge this much you also have to provide the training, the service, whatever the non-price inducements are.\n You could. You could also require those things without resale price maintenance and then the retailer would be free to decide to raise the price to pay for that or to provide it so efficiently that he could in effect engage  \n But then the retailer, but then the retailer might have a real incentive not to do a good job on the service because they really want to market it for price, not for service.\n That really depends, doesn't it, on what the consumers in the market want, and if it's correct, if the manufacturer   if the claim on behalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the customers want is service, the retailers are in at least as good a position to identify that fact as not. I think the point  \n Well, but there you have the free rider problem, which is you go to the fancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then you buy it at the discount store.\n Yes. That's at its peak, perhaps, when you're talking about electronics. When the shopping experience alone is what is thought to be the benefit, which is often the case, you can't free ride on that. You either shop in the place where you like to shop or you shop   or you have a different shopping experience in Target.\n But some manufacturers want their product associated with excellent service, high warranty, and all of that. And there is no way to get that uniformly for that product without this kind of agreement.\n Yes, there is. The manufacturer can contract for it. The manufacturer can decline to deal with people who don't provide it. The very same point that was being made earlier. I think that the point here is that permitting resale price maintenance would be such a drastic change in the longstanding settled interpretation of the Sherman Act that it doesn't really qualify as the kind of common law evolution that this Court has said is appropriate ordinarily in making antitrust rules under the Sherman Act. If that change is to be made at all, it should be made by Congress and not by this Court.\n Am I correct on the congressional point that there was a period when Congress would have prohibited the Solicitor General from making the argument he made today?\n Yes, there was such a period. And this Court noted that fact in  \n So there was a legislative expression of a position on this particular issue?\n There was a legislative expression of position on this particular issue.\n And that no longer is applicable?\n That is   the Solicitor General is no longer barred from making that argument, as is evidenced today. What he  \n I guess Congress changed its mind then.\n No, I think Congress found it unnecessary or perhaps questioned the wisdom or constitutionality of barring the Solicitor General from making particular arguments.\n I find it hard to believe that. (Laughter.)\n But Congress has consistently   well, and the repeal   the reason the repeal of the Miller-Tydings Act seems particularly relevant is that it is indeed   it was an amendment to this statute that this Court is being asked to interpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning of this statute as it stands.\n As Mr. Olson pointed out, under the fair trade laws this was per se legal. So that's kind of a different thing.\n Yes. But when Congress repealed that, there were considerable   there was considerable expression of legislative history, for those who find legislative history helpful, that declared opposition to resale price maintenance, not simply that it was sometimes helpful and sometimes hurtful. So to the extent Congress's intent can be gleaned from that legislative history, it was an intent to return to the regime of per se illegality.\n Maybe on the year by year, don't spend any money on, maybe Congress decided that wasn't an appropriate technique, but Congress has used that after, hasn't it, in other cases?\n It has, but I would question the wisdom of that technique as a method of expressing Congress's views. The fact that Congress went so far as to use it once suggests a very strong view indeed.\n Thank you, Ms. Underwood. Mr. Olson, you have 3 minutes remaining.\n The Respondent and its amici seem to recognize that what this Court said in State Oil versus Khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand competition on matters of service and availability and other things in addition to price. The Respondent and their amici seem to have acknowledged these pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a Colgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a blunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with which you had a relationship for years, it prohibits even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small problems.\n But you're just giving them an additional ground for termination.\n Pardon me?\n You're just giving, you're just suggesting we should give them an additional ground for termination.\n No. What we're suggesting is that the agreement is something, the details can be worked out. The manufacturer can   and the Ping brief explains this. The manufacturer can go to the retailer and say: Look, maybe you didn't get it right, your sales person said the wrong thing; let's fix it, because we want to be dealing together. The antitrust laws   in other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or they suggest forward integration, so you just acquire all your retailers. The benefits of these type of arrangements provide the consumers with choices. It stimulates interbrand competition. It promotes intrabrand competition on things other than price. It provides consumers with more choices. It ultimately gives more freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its products, to enter the marketplace. These are things that the Court has said, and provides a more varied market price. The court has repeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of reason. Per se rules should be crossed out or not adopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is invariably anticompetitive. This practice, as acknowledged, is procompetitive. It provides many opportunities, and it is irrational for vertical restrictions to exist in this world in the non-price area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a rigid per se rule that cannot be changed. And as this Court has repeatedly held, Congress intended by the use of restraint of trade and the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the benefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do something that's rational in the marketplace, to give consumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that is a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare makes no sense at all. For all those reasons, the rule of reason in this area, as in the other areas, should replace the per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the end of the day. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Olson. The case is submitted.\n"}
