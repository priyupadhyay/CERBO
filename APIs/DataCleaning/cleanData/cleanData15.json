{"argument in American Trucking Associations ": " Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Under the decision below, title IX stands alone as the only major civil rights statute that would permit retaliation against those who complain that the law is being violated. There are at least a half a dozen anti-discrimination laws that do not contain a separate retaliation provision, and every one of them has been found to prohibit retaliation as one kind of discrimination. There's a reason for that. Anti-discrimination laws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation are allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their institutions into compliance.\n Of course, the question is whether that that may be true, but there would be an administrative remedy. The question here is a private cause of action for damages.\n That is true, Justice Kennedy.\n Even even assuming the the validity of your premise, you still have another step.\n I understand that other step, and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by Congress, as this Court every member of this Court recognized in in Sandoval.\n I thought I thought that Cannon we've we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.\n In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action. The first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title IX. That's Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through your opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated. Title IX is violated by retaliatory action against Coach Jackson. He's and and this is an important part of title IX because, particularly here, people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because students are often minors. They're not in the best position to know the budgets. It is people like Coach Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is recognized about the about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.\n It's very it's very useful, I'm sure, but it it could be very disruptive also, I am sure. If I were if I were a coach, one of the first things especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not not getting enough facilities. This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether whether I'm a lousy coach or not. You you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.\n Justice Scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation. And you should take great comfort from the fact, the Court can take great comfort from the fact that retaliation has been established as a violation of all of the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to title VI  \n Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?\n That is correct.\n Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?\n Well, Congress has taken a different approach. In some cases, there would be a textual problem. Title VII, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin. Title and and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision. Title IX speaks upon about discrimination on the basis of sex. And here I think to to allay your concern about the coach, we have had title IX's retaliation provision has been the established law. It was the law at the time Congress it was understood, at the time Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of title VI had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation. Congress enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation. So that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title IX. In over 30 years, there at most we can find 140 reported cases in the Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and in in dealing with retaliation cases. Now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls. When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.\n Do you think that it it is a reasonable description of what happened he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?\n Absolutely.\n Do you think that that remotely describes what happened to this coach?\n Absolutely. First of all, the the court of appeals correctly says in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX violations. But for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position. He is denied the benefit of coaching in the program. He's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation. And this is not a case in which that has concern I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and I understand the special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the Federal funds. This is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted. At that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known. Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that. We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education and  \n But but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation. And was it Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore. You have to show that there's a congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a private cause of action for damages.\n I think the Court  \n And that's that's quite separate from  \n Yes. I I  \n from this from the question of substantive liability.\n I understand that. Here, first of all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when it passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was a background in the law from Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park that that retaliation was considered a part of discrimination. The title VI regulations were themselves well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim language. It provided for retaliation. And moreover, this Court as recently as the Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that Cannon v. the City of v. the University of Chicago creates that cause of action. Now, this case is actually a lot easier than Davis, even taking into account the concerns that that you and other Justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control. This is deliberately undertaken actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally. It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of discrimination. But it's been accepted for more than 30 years by the responsible Federal agency.\n Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them. Yes, litigation for for discrimination against against female athletes, but not not discrimination suits alleging retaliation. That's a whole, new area.\n Justice Scalia, with with all due respect, I don't think there's any way, when the district accepted these funds, that they could have reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be free to retaliate against people who tried to comply  \n Well, but there was there was let's go back to this for just a moment an administrative remedy available for retaliation expressly under the regs?\n That is correct.\n And did this petitioner seek an administrative remedy at all?\n He did not seek an administrative remedy. He went through the school system itself at every level. He went through five different levels, following the chain of command.\n What would the administrative remedy have allowed here  \n Well  \n had it been sought?\n Here, as in Franklin, as in Davis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with race, you can call this to attention to the office of civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an inquiry. Ultimately they have the authority of the draconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the  \n Do they have any other sanction? Because the notion of an administrative remedy ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's complaining. But as I understand it, this administrative process, this detailed administrative process, leads only to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.\n That is correct.\n So that's it. It would not have permitted a restoration of the job to the  \n That is correct.\n petitioner.\n That is not part of the the administrative process is only about institutional funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld the right to bring these actions for what are violations of the statute itself.\n Well, if we don't accept let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that that we're having trouble accepting the the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms. You then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.\n That is  \n So so the the argument is you you should recognize this as a necessity. That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice O'Connor's question. Why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy? And I thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason. So my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude to to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?\n That that is absolutely right.\n What's what are the facts? What's the empirical evidence for that?\n Well  \n Do you know if administrative sanctions have been imposed under title IX against schools?\n Well, I'm sure there have been some instances in which there have been administrative sanctions under title IX. And I don't I do not have figures on those, Justice O'Connor. But let me  \n Have funds  \n let me suggest  \n have funds Mr. Dellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any school because of a violation of  \n Not to my knowledge.\n title IX?\n But I think  \n That could be because  \n I actually have  \n the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach. Of course, they're going to rehire. I I find it hard to believe why a draconian sanction is ineffective.\n Well, if it's never I I  \n It seems to me it's it's overwhelmingly effective. You tell the school you either rehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.\n Justice  \n Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?\n I do have an answer, first, for Justice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greensberger. The sanction has never been imposed under title IX of cutting off funds. And it  \n And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction. Which doesn't help  \n That is certainly not what  \n the girls on the team.\n Coach Coach Jackson would have sought, and and because that process is not one that's responsive to the individual case if you're down in Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office that has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a sanction, the fact of the matter is and it's the reason  \n Well, you're saying the coach cares more about it than the Government does?\n That may well be the case, absolutely. And Coach Jackson  \n Well, if if the Government is charged with with just spending the funds and doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should there be a private cause of action  \n Because  \n when when a private cause of action is harder for us to imply than it than it is to an administrative remedy?\n Because in this case people like Coach Jackson it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to come forward. If he's not able to if he's not protected and able to come forward, if retaliation is possible, then you can't expect the the teenagers themselves to carry this burden. And in fact, it's the reason this Court recognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in Davis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to protect the whistle blower and they're not going to be able to come forward. And it's not just whistle blowers, Justice Kennedy. It's people that want to make their institutions comply and when those efforts at compliance result in penalties against them. It has not led to an excessive amount of litigation, but it has been very effective in giving people comfort to know that they can't be retaliated against. And and I I understand the going to the necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the statute because it is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex. It is part and parcel. The history of discrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing people from their jobs is what you did when they complained about discrimination, when they tried to vote, when they tried to enroll their students in schools, and it is part and parcel of that discrimination. And it is discrimination against Coach Jackson for his actions on behalf of sex. Thank you.\n Mr.  \n I'll reserve the balance of my time.\n Mr. Gornstein, do you have any light to shed on the extent to which administrative sanctions have ever been imposed against schools and and the feasibility of going that route?\n Administrative sanction has never been imposed under title IX.\n They have been under title VI?\n There has been one case in which an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI, Justice Kennedy. It the agency does have some flexibility to attempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the sanction, the final sanction, but  \n Do you take the position that what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the statute as discrimination?\n We do, Justice Justice O'Connor. I'm sorry. Retaliation against a person because that person has complained about sex discrimination under title IX is itself discrimination within the meaning of title IX. And that conclusion flows from four considerations, beginning with the Court's decision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the Court held that a person subjected to retaliation because he complained about racial discrimination against his lessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which only prohibits racial discrimination. Against the backdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have understood its prohibition against sex discrimination to afford comparable protection against retaliation. So a person who is subjected  \n Why would Congress then in some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others not? I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?\n It is, Justice O'Connor, but the explanation for that for in title VII, for example, is that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or national origin, and that such individual's language rules out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about here.\n It rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim. Usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever. That's that's the classic retaliation claim. And that classic claim is surely covered by on the basis of that person's sex. If  \n If it's based on the fact that the that the person is complaining about sex discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have here, Justice Scalia. And that theory of discrimination was recognized in the Sullivan decision. Discrimination occurs when there is retaliation against a person because he's complaining about racial discrimination.\n What was the date of the Sullivan case?\n It was 3 years before Congress enacted section I think it was '68 '69. I'm sorry. '69.\n '69.\n It was '69, Justice Scalia.\n And and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?\n You do not, Justice Scalia, when you are starting afresh, but  \n And we certainly did not with a Spending Clause case.\n That's true, Justice Kennedy. But to answer Justice Scalia's question, first, you operate in the legal context in which Congress was operating at the time, and Congress would have understood and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivan decision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding that there was a private right of action and once in deciding that the private right of action included a claim for damages.\n I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. We said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a Congress that that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or or not. And and that's what you're asking us to do here.\n Justice  \n Just because Congress in in the at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we we have to do that for all these old statutes.\n Let let me talk about the cases that I think the principle that you're talking about emerges from. One is the Central Bank case, and what you were asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and abetters, to the statute. We're not asking you to add words to this statute. We're asking you to interpret the words that are there  \n But what about Virginia  \n in light of the relevant context.\n What about Virginia Bankshares?\n I'm I'm not sure about Virginia Bankshares, but I don't think it it states a principle. The other case that I was thinking about, Justice Kennedy, is the is the Sandoval case. And again, there somebody was asking you to afford a private right of action for something that the statute did not itself prohibit. And what we are saying here is, interpret this statute in light of the legal context that Congress had it, which is  \n Well, it it's arguable except that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated against because of his gender.\n That's correct. But this statute does not require discrimination because of such individual's sex. It require  \n exactly like title VII, but  \n It's it's written exactly not like title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan, which doesn't have a such individual's limitation. And in and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of property violates that statute and affords a private right of action to the victim of retaliation. And so too here. And a person who is victimized by retaliation because that person has been subjected before because he complained about sex discrimination is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this statute.\n And that's where you hang. You you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We have to take out that person's. I I don't it doesn't strike me as a as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex. It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.\n But this is it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations. Inserting the words, such individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation claim, and it's not here. And so it's then you have to look at all the other relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this provision have both interpreted the key agencies have interpreted it to encompass protection against retaliation, and including the fact that there's absolutely no legitimate interest that a a recipient has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.\n Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.\n That's correct. In it we we have taken the position that there is, based on a textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above the use of discrimination. We have not taken that position with respect to the to some other statutes. So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it automatically always picks up retaliation protection. You have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis. And here, though, all the relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for this kind of protection to further the purposes of the statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that this was prohibited, included in I think I wanted to get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending Clause. What the Spending Clause does not require is that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer harassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice, and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision, this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and finally the regulations themselves, which specifically forbid retaliation.\n Are punitive damages available under title IX?\n I'm sorry. Punitive damages would not be available against a municipality or against a but it could be available against some other private recipients.\n Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Thomas.\n Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Justice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the question that you raised immediately. I can't think of any school board lawyer who is called by his superintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and they want to know why you aren't doing this and that who would not be in that superintendent's office that moment because when OCR comes in, they canvas everything. I mean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative teams, they're lay people. They're not lawyers. They come in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I can't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is. And so I say I wanted you to  \n How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX? There are many statutes that  \n And I would want to suggest  \n OCR administers.\n In 1996, we had a conclusion of an OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls. So we we know about OCR, and they're in Atlanta. They are about 167 miles away and when and when they come, they come, Your Honors. If I may, I'd like to get right now to what I had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an implied private right of action under title IX for retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. He's an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.\n How does he differ how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this Court said he could maintain that suit.\n Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one observation. Under 1982, there is not a corollary administrative remedy. So in the Sullivan situation, the only advocate available at that time was the owner of the home. And but I would comment that as he continued in his litigation, he continued to advocate. Under title IX, as we have discussed, for the advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and express your concerns and your issues about what's happening. And we find significance in that because the ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would be the basketball team. In a private lawsuit filed by Mr. Jackson, the damage award goes directly to him. If he's successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to him. In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the future, but nothing from that Federal court would go to benefit the girls' basketball team.\n Well, what what do you make of the the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world? It's it's there there have never there has never been an instance in which funds have been withheld.\n Well, again, Justice Souter, no, the funds have not been terminated. But I can only share with you my experiences with dealing with these people.\n May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate? How many times do they say, well, that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?\n Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that I can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep OCR out. So so therefore  \n But that wasn't my question. My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?\n Well, Your Honor, that was something that was recognized in Cannon. I I think that was cited in several of the footnotes.\n And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.\n But but again, stay mindful. Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get admission to the the med school because of my sex, and she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on the basis of sex. So  \n Yes, but the the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on the the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the that if if once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and and so simply to say, well, they're not within the the primary ambit of benefit of the statute is is not to the point of the argument.\n Justice Souter, let me offer this in two ways. One, it's not realistic. In in other words, when when you have a scenario about the private cause of action, teachers aren't I mean, these parents and and the and especially in Birmingham, we have an athletic director at the school. We have a director of athletics for the whole school system. And so that that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the day, the administration is very conscientious about all of its programs.\n Well, that's to say trust me is is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.\n But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.\n The the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.\n Well, but again, though, Justice Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that  \n Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly the the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?\n But that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process. Now, Justice Ginsburg  \n The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?\n No, it did not.\n And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.\n It's not on the face.\n But the regulation did tell the school not to retaliate in effect. Tell me, does the record disclose what happened to the petitioner, Jackson? What what has been the result of all this? Does the record tell us that?\n No, it does not, Justice O'Connor. And and again, it's on a motion to dismiss, and obviously, once it was  \n Does it tell us that he was removed as coach?\n Yes.\n Does the record tell us that?\n It it does say that he was relieved.\n Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?\n Yes.\n But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's. They pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was associating with people who were black. And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service. Maybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them. Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the the civil rights statute? I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can. Would you do you think it's the contrary answer?\n Justice Breyer, in that context  \n Yes.\n I I would say yes.\n Yes, of course.\n But again  \n So therefore  \n Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action? I I want to know what the hypothetical is.\n I'd I'd like to I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe to to discriminate. And now, I agree with you on that answer. The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being he's associated with people who are being discriminated against. I agree with your answer. And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex that's what I've complained of why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question there are two parts why isn't this the same thing? And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing the second part is once it is included in 1981 in is it 1681(a)?\n Yes.\n Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side. It doesn't support you. All right. That's my question.\n Justice Breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?\n Well, yes.\n And again and I submit to you  \n So you you go ahead. I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race. History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case. So I would like your response to that logic.\n And I would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. So everybody now has access to Congress. The whole spectrum of American society is in Congress. So if Congress is being well represented, when it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a different perspective on it. Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed to some of the citizens of the United States. So, obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in Sullivan, would make sense. But I submit to you respectfully, that's not the case now. Over there in Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face of this statute, it's not there. Retaliation is not there. If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also add as a practical consideration  \n Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there. Isn't that correct?\n But but that's an an investigatory the administrative enforcement scenario.\n But it's the  \n No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim. That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word the words in this statute.\n But don't we go Justice Stevens, don't we go back to Sandoval? Can you in a regulation do more than what the statute requires?\n You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute. That's what that holds. But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park. And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.\n But but again, that's retaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the appropriate office.\n Well I mean, Sandoval is very clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very clear. And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority I was in the dissent did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the same I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it. The the I apply the same reasoning here. The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred. Now, what's what's that's how I'm tracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what you say.\n Well, Justice Breyer, on the face of the statute, I just can't get there. I apologize for that, respectfully, but but I can't. And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up, interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt v. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the Northern District of Birmingham for the Northern District of Alabama made very clear that an implied private right of action was not cognizable under title IX, and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it. And and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham, at very least, because the case was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so anyone who would go  \n We we can't you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari  \n No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.\n Thank you.\n But but to say I was trying to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board when it accepted these Federal funds. It had no way of anticipating that retaliation  \n It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago? Maybe more than that. I don't remember.\n Justice Cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time. The scholars are going to have to debate it for years.\n There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.\n But Congress itself has adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.\n But but if I may, but then Justice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action absent such specificity on the part of the legislative branch. And that just speaks volumes to me.\n It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way  \n Yes, ma'am.\n title VII VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs. So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination, sex discrimination do have a a private right of action, and that was the holding of this Court.\n Yes, ma'am. Well, but but again, it goes goes back to but would that include retaliation? And and  \n Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher. And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it. You have nice words on paper and they'll never be enforced.\n But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher could easily, if they don't get a positive response from the administration, they can call OCR.\n And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy. Sorry.\n No. They no  \n Congress didn't give us enough money to do the job.\n Do we know that? I mean, do we have any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is? Just because they haven't cut off funds  \n I I  \n they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.\n Justice Scalia, that's exactly it. I mean, I have firsthand knowledge that when they call, we're supposed to jump. It's no doubt about it.\n And do they call more than infrequently?\n All the time. And and the other side of that coin  \n This is your personal testimony.\n Yes, ma'am. Yes, it is. (Laughter.)\n And and Justice  \n There is there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.\n Well, I've been in educational law now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school boards. So I have firsthand knowledge. I mean and I've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher ed. I mean, when they come in, they come in.\n How many title IX complaints in your in your experience? You mentioned one. Is there any other?\n Two.\n Two? In how many years?\n In 26.\n Two in 20-something years.\n Yes, ma'am. But they're all memorable. (Laughter.)\n They're all thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Mr. Newsom.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns that have been raised during the the preceding arguments. One is to clarify some things about the scope of the administrative remedy. The other side, with respect, wants you to think that without the implied right of action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out in the cold. That is not true. The administrative remedy it's not just about funding termination. 34 C.F.R. 106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary. The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself touted its flexible approach to enforcement which includes, among other things, as this Court noted in Gebser, citing back to its earlier pardon me decision in North Haven, individualized relief in appropriate circumstances. So the point, as Senator Bayh himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is the threat of of funding termination. So while the OCR is wielding the club of funding termination, they can extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate cases.\n Do we do we have any any empirical evidence as to as to what they have thus leveraged?\n None that I am aware of, Your Your Honor, but  \n The the other side says, look, dead letter. What do we know about such life as there may be in the letter?\n Well well, I will, I assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office to tell you what what the DOJ has and hasn't done. What I can tell you is that that the DOJ manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants. So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.\n You you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not  \n Of course not.\n and if they are inefficient to to raise up private attorneys general to to fill the void?\n Of course not, Justice Scalia, and and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.\n All right. If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides do you think it's unlawful?\n We do not contest the validity of the regulation.\n Okay. If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n What what is it doing?\n It section 100.7(e), the regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all all it does by its text and its structure makes clear all it does is to govern the internal processes of official OCR investigations. It does not go further than that. This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it was that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action. Another point I want to make about the administrative remedy. Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement. Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources. That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination. But as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this out in some detail there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the either either in the judicial system or at OCR.\n Why is that, do you think?\n Well, my I'm sorry.\n Is it because no remedy is available, or is it because there are just very few instances giving rise to such?\n Well, I think in all likelihood, it is the latter. Certainly I would think that the Court would presume would not presume ill of local school districts and and even State universities, but would presume that they are complying with, if not clearly articulated law, certainly good public policy. The second point is that what the the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.\n Do we decide this case on the assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a complaint of violation of title IX?\n Certainly, Your Honor  \n We should decide it on that assumption?\n You have to take as true, of course, the facts as pledged in the as pleaded in the complaint. Another point I'd like to make briefly is about the comparison to title VII. The other side wants you to look very closely at title VII when you're whether it's on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation in a separate subsection, a separate provision. And I didn't I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during the first argument. I had my head in my own book, but what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the the an instance in which Congress has a choice of two models for for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow Congress to make that choice. That's what happened here.\n Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it this this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983. So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.\n Well, if if I could answer in two parts. First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination. And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model. Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan. First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque. It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary  \n It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.\n Even if I were to grant your assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I presume, would not agree with he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court was trying to do. But even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is is passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable  \n Yes, but it did construe the word discrimination, didn't it?\n No, sir. Discrimination is not even in is not even in title rather, in 1982. So the language is very different  \n On account of race is in it. Right?\n I'll have to confess I don't it does say something like every person shall have the same right as dot, dot, dot, as white persons. But so the the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if that's true for for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would have gotten its clear notice in this case. If you can imagine  \n It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute. We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.\n I agree, and and if and if the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but instead that that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations. So to be sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not retaliate in in the business of an official OCR investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent  \n But it's we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What must you do to comply? And it has in there you don't retaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate? I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.\n And and with respect, I think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this Court has has used in Spending Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR investigation and retaliation generally, but I'm sorry.\n I I really don't get that. If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going that's going to be on our checklist. But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.\n Justice Stevens, may I respond?\n Yes.\n Even granting your assumption, Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to to a private right of action for damages and fees even in in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.\n Thank you, Mr. Newsom.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens.\n Mr. Dellinger, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n I should make it clear that we're not asking this Court to create or infer a new cause of action. We're asking the Court to interpret the cause of action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress. It was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval. And when you look at the scope of that of that prohibition, that cause of action, why would it not extend to retaliation? The idea that you  \n Other statutes do it separately.\n I understand.\n Other statutes don't view the one as as being incorporated in the other.\n The practice of Congress has not been consistent on incorporating express provisions sometimes because of language differences, but there are half a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have consistently assumed included retaliation as part of discrimination. Section 1981, section 1982, title VI, 1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way. And why would they not? The notion that you have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and expel her for complaining about your admissions policy makes no sense. In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what any administration might do about enforcement is not necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this Court's decision in Cannon. And it's reaffirmed it frankly  \n There are no vagaries in private enforcement. Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity. There are no vagaries there.\n Well, in this case, it has been known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to bring them about by allowing people to step forward. The last point they make is that even if there's a cause of action, and even if the cause of action covers retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination. That makes no sense in law or in logic. If the captain of the boys' basketball team joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls' basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended from their teams or dropped from the honor society in retaliation, it makes no sense. Either they both have they've both been discriminated against on the basis of sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination or neither is. And in this case, it's going to be critically important that this valuable statute, which has meant so much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow them to come forward within the school itself and try to rectify these anomalies in and under title IX. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: These two contract cases concern whether the Government is liable in money damages under the Contract Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self-Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a contract price for the  \n Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate? The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth Circuit went another. And are the claims at all overlapping? How are they differentiated?\n No, Justice O'Connor. They're they're not overlapping. The claims in the Federal Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996. And the Cherokee contract at issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit is fiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement. The section remedial section of the act, section 110  \n But they're certainly at odds on the legal theory.\n Yes, they are, Your Honor. The Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation, the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is enacted by Congress. And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the contracts in this case under the circumstances presented. And to the contrary. We submit that the Secretary's construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo section 106(b) of the act  \n Are the circumstances any different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case and the one in the Federal Circuit? Are are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?\n No, Justice O'Connor. There there is no difference in that respect, and there is an overlap in in this sense. The Shoshone-Paiute contract that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee contract that covered fiscal year 1996. So in that sense, both cases involved the the same relevant issues. The the key, we think, to the resolution of the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to our opening blue brief. The act was amended in this section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding discretion over contract funding issues. In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then directly pertinent to this case is subparagraph (2), which directs which addresses contract support costs. There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of certain items. Incidentally, these items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs, procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by the Office of Personnel Management.\n Does the do the actual contracts reduce the the CSC's to a dollar amount or  \n Yes, they do.\n So so we know they they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.\n That is correct, Justice Souter. In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated contract amount.\n I don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if if you choose. But it seems to me relevant to (a). Does is is part of the submission that the Government used some of the funds that otherwise would have gone to you for its own monitoring and of of health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? Or was it just general overhead for other programs it used?\n It it is precisely, Justice Kennedy, what what you stated. In fact, we can turn directly to page 14a  \n I I stated an or. I what I I stated at the outset?\n The the Government took money for its own Federal functions instead of including contract monitoring  \n Including contract monitoring.\n Including contract monitoring. Including contract monitoring. In fact, they say so in their brief and and defend that action. The the sections on page 12a and 13a articulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of the contract support costs that must be added.\n These are strange contracts, of course, aren't they? I mean, are there any other contracts that the Government has to enter into? I mean, the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to take over, in effect, implementation of the of a Federal health program, doesn't he?\n That is correct, Justice Scalia.\n Well, I why would you expect that this strange kind of contract should should, prima facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations as other contracts  \n Because  \n where where an agency, having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will limit the number of contracts it enters into? But but here you're creating a situation where the agency has to contract and yet has no control over having enough money to to meet the contractual obligations. It seems to me a a strange way to run a railroad.\n It it is a unique contractual situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully anticipated. And and I would explain it this way. First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act which Congress said applies to these contracts. The contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims, then the Court of Claims, and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under the Contract Disputes Act. And the legislative history explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for the stated contract price.\n But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?\n The the procurement contract that is correct. Not the contracts themselves, Your Honor. The the act says that  \n Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.\n the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy. That's correct. These contracts began as procurement contracts. They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they were not enforced under the Court of the Interior Board of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision. Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which it wanted to eliminate. And for that reason, it eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along with it.\n Mr. Miller, do  \n Justice Ginsburg.\n on on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call Federal functions, that it every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal functions?\n Justice Ginsburg, I I would put my answer in this context. There are many sources from which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these contracts. It could have been, yes, as we submit, from the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial administration. It could have been from the up to $88 million increases Congress was making every year. It could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could have been from the regional and headquarters offices that the agencies had where they don't administer services.\n But your your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they  \n That's the duty Congress imposed upon the Secretary. The Secretary was free not to reprogram. That's that's a choice the Secretary had and the Secretary made it. The question is what are the ramifications of that choice and we submit  \n Well, let me ask you another question related. Suppose this is an individual action. These are individual actions. They're not class actions.\n Correct, Your Honor.\n Do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full? Does it just depend on first come to court, first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?\n Your Honor, we we do not believe that that that should be the outcome. That would advantage the contractors that came forward and not take account of the entire situation. We think the global situation has to be looked at. The total amount of the contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994  \n I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip. I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the question, what if there is not enough money to go around?\n If there were only sufficient money to pay half of the contract shortfalls  \n Right.\n without violating the clause and the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of money.\n Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?\n No, Justice Kennedy, and and to the contrary. In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health Service was telling everybody they were paying them in full. They told the General Accounting Office they paid everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in the Government's brief. But  \n So these these are reliance damages in a sense.\n The the tribes expected to be paid. The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be paid in full in the first year.\n I mean, they they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?\n That is correct. That is correct.\n Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually will have available to spend?\n The contractors don't know until the year is over because throughout the year, the Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but stated in a circular, to reprogram. And the appropriations  \n What what do you mean by that? You said a second ago the Secretary had the option to reprogram. What do you mean by reprogram?\n When the Secretary prepares a budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum amount of, say, $1.8 billion. We we take $400 million off the top or $300 million off the top because that was specified by Congress for certain purposes. But the balance is a lump sum. The Secretary crafts a budget. The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar amount is adopted by Congress. Now, Congress can step in and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.\n Yes, but the the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?\n The tribes enter into contracts, as most Government contractors do when they enter into contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if the agency will have the money to pay them. That's okay. The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the appropriations. It's been the law for 120 years that at that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is entitled to be paid.\n All right. So how was that appropriation money in fact used by the Federal Government, do you say?\n The Federal Government  \n There was the appropriation.\n Yes.\n And the tribes had already entered into contracts. Now, how was that lump sum used?\n The agency then, under this Court's teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion over how it spends its appropriation except insofar as  \n Is that what you mean by programming?\n Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for taking me back to your question. What we mean is that the Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding on the Secretary. It's not binding as a matter of law because Congress didn't adopt it. And as conditions change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts its budget, which we call reprogramming.\n So programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.\n Correct.\n Okay.\n And the Secretary retains complete discretion as this Court taught  \n And is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?\n Well, it should not be done without regard to the contract amounts  \n Is that in fact how it was done?\n That is in fact how it was done.\n And is it still done that way?\n Well, the times have changed. Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on the contracts and court costs that the agency has. So there's no question the agency cannot pay more than Congress gives it. When Congress only gives it $100 million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's it. The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more.\n But didn't didn't Congress, even before that, impose a significant limitation on how much the Secretary could pay? What do you with the provision in in (b) of of the section that you were reading from? Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this chapter. I mean, what what money that the Secretary expends is is not expended for programs, projects, or activities that serve a tribe?\n Justice Scalia, we read this this clause with keeping in mind the first sentence first of the sentence. The first sentence, which begins on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract monitoring or administration by the Secretary. And the subparagraph (3) in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions.\n Well, that's all very good, but  \n But then there's an exception.\n then the last paragraph begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter. So this  \n We  \n it seems to me, overrides everything else. Unless unless you can persuade me that that that that provision doesn't give the Secretary the authority to to allocate the available funds among other activities that serve tribes, I I think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.\n Justice Scalia, for for two reasons we think it cannot. First of all, if that exception swallowed up the rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the whole purpose of the act. And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a mandatory rule of construction that Congress has articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government never cites in the statutory interpretation case. And this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the act  \n Wait.\n Page sorry  \n 21 of  \n 21a of our opening blue brief.\n Okay, 21a, good.\n 21a, correct. Each provision of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and each provision of this contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the contractor. That statement is repeated as well in every  \n Oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means. The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.\n So what could it mean? That's our challenge.\n Now, what does it mean?\n We have to give it meaning. We believe it means the as the Secretary always said when and and said at the time these amendments were adopted in 1988, that's services on the ground, the hospitals and clinics. If I walked into the office of the headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville, Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white jackets. I'm not going to see patients and counselors. There aren't programs serving tribes in these headquarters offices, and in these area offices, large portions of what they do are administrative functions.\n All right. May may I interrupt you there? And tell me if I understand the the position in your brief correctly. I thought the position that you took there was ultimately regardless of what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that is actually made. And if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the is the is the agency itself. Its bureaucracy is going to have less money. And I understood your argument to be that given the provisions you read earlier in this section, Congress has made a positive decision that if there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed. Is that your position?\n That is our position.\n If that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?\n Well, we still need to provide some meaning to the to the provision that says the Secretary may not does not have to reduce funding for programs serving other tribes. I guess, I think we do need to grapple with the clause in order not to  \n But but I thought you were saying you could you could the the Secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes. The Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody is going to get the short end, it's going to be the bureaucracy.\n It's going to be the bureaucracy.\n Just give them the just give them the money.\n It's not going to be the programs on the ground serving the tribes. It's going to be the bureaucracy.\n Okay.\n Now, it may be felt  \n To put it this is a competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program of programs. I mean, it's it's not as though it's a bureaucracy against the people. The whole purpose of this was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these programs from Government bureaucrats to tribal bureaucrats. I mean, it  \n Well, I would I would  \n you you paint it as though the you know, who cares about the bureaucrats. The the Government just wasn't interested in the bureaucrats. That may well be, but there there are bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.\n I say that for two reasons. First of all, the the Congress, in our opinion, clearly privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's Federal functions. But more practically, let's look at the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. They took over a hospital that had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract support costs requirement was $2 million. So the contract was in round numbers $7 million. So they get the hospital, $5 million to run it. They don't get the $2 million. Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital. It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy. They didn't get the full hospital operational budget because they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance, undertaking the audits required by Federal law. There were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact, that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.\n Can I ask you a basic question  \n Yes, Justice Breyer.\n which maybe others understand, but I'm confused. Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians. It is simply an ordinary contract. Now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations. So we have to decide was there an appropriation. In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't made. Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts. You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah, I'm not sure. All right. Now, I want if I have the the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these for this Indian expenditure. Just pretend it's a regular contract. What is the equivalent of that $10 million?\n The equivalent of the $10 million would be sums not spent on anything  \n Yes.\n in this case, up to $100 million.\n Yes, okay. And anything else?\n Any of the increases, any of the sums. And then we move to this statute  \n Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there. I want you to tell me why those sums I get the time. I get the amount.\n Why the purpose.\n Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.\n Well, that's one of the things the the Government and we agree upon.\n It was one of the purposes.\n One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act. So that satisfies the purpose test.\n All right. So you think you and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the Government.\n That is correct, Your Honor.\n Okay.\n Well, you can't say that the Government agrees to that. You certainly agree to it.\n No, no. Were it an ordinary  \n The Government  \n were it an ordinary contract.\n In in the hypothetical. No. I think the Government would agree that the rule of Ferris and Blackhawk, the Dougherty rule from the Court of Claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when you sign a contract with the Government and a lump sum appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring Government operations and figuring out how much do they want to boost their functions for this or that or the other, and the  \n So our issue as far as you're concerned and I'll ask the Government the same question is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et cetera? And your claim is, I can't find any difference. And their claim is there will be some difference. Is that right?\n That is correct. They claim these aren't contracts Justice Kennedy.\n Well, you did say the these contracts were unique.\n These contracts are unique. The contracts in Winstar were unique. The contracts in the United States v. New Mexico advance costs advance funded cost reimbursable contracts. Many contracts are unique. The question is whether the distinction makes a difference in the law. The distinction here that these are not procurement contracts, that can't be decisive.\n Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.\n But that's not unique either because the the Government, the Department of Defense in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision of food to our troops in Iraq. That's a quintessential governmental services, feeding the military. But they contract it out. No one would suggest there that just because it's a governmental service, it qualifies that contract as a lesser contract than any other contract.\n Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq. They contracted it out to a private contractor. I mean, what what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these these tribes more governmental power, more self-determination. The whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.\n Absolutely. And even Congress considered  \n That's that's what makes it different from private contracts  \n We  \n even even with Halliburton.\n We  \n I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody.\n We submit that that difference was considered by Congress. In the 1988 amendments, there's even language that says, we're thinking about maybe calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've decided to call it a contract because we want it to be enforceable as a contract, just as other Government contracts for goods and services are enforced. And that was the language of the of the Senate report. They then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a remedy in money damages. In those respects, along with the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Justice Stevens.\n Thank you. Mr. Srinivasan.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for performance of those core agency functions that the agency itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum appropriation among tribes. Now, the tribes have to point to some source of funding within that lump sum appropriation.\n Well, they just did, the 2 percent. So my question to you is the same. I asked, let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing to do with it. It was a typical, ordinary Government contract for pencils. All right? Or for soda water. Now, and everything were the same. Under those circumstances, just an ordinary contract and they point to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in the Court of Claims. But but we have we have a contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the contract because that 2 percent is available, legally speaking, time, purpose, and and amount. Okay? Classic. Now, what's the Government's view there?\n No.\n Is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?\n No. With respect to the 2 percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions, that's not available.\n I'm asking all right. Are is the Government's view then let's treat this just as an ordinary contract? Still it there was no money available.\n With respect to  \n Legally speaking under the time-purpose-amount test.\n Well, Justice Breyer, I'm drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's reserved for core agency functions and  \n No.\n it's been a background principle of Government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that that the Government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out. So I think that informs the interpretation of the subject to availability clause.\n Now, I would like an answer to my question, yes or no. If this were an ordinary contract with a subject to appropriations clause, is would the Government be saying this is invalid because the appropriations were not there?\n Well, you have to look at the particular context.\n There must be a yes or no answer to that.\n It would be no if this statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer.\n No. What it is is a contract for pencils. Can you not is it impossible  \n If if all  \n to make you see what I'm driving  \n If if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.\n Correct, and which are the funds that are that would be available here? Which are they?\n There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because  \n If this were under Blackhawk.\n Under Blackhawk, it would be it would it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be be directed in any particular manner. Now, there are some provisions in the  \n That includes the 2 percent that you keep referring to.\n That that would include in the that would include the 2 percent. But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services. So you'd have to take into account  \n Okay. Then let me do this then.\n those particular provisos.\n You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit. Now, tell me specifically, if you can and this may take you the whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want. What is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?\n Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute. If you look at page 15a of the appendix to to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause. You have to look at the particular context in which this statute  \n Well, the language is the same.\n It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect. It says, notwithstanding any other provision and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and and this is  \n That phrase is the same, subject to the availability of appropriations.\n That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.\n Exactly.\n But the term available and I think this is critical. The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.\n But but the other the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes. It's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your your headquarters operating budget for IHS. So they say, if I understand them, that the that the nonreduction clause doesn't save you here because you could have paid it without reducing things for other tribes.\n I I think that argument is incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause. But second of all, the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to to the terms of the ISDA itself. And if you'll look at page 12a and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1) what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided. And then later on down in the paragraph  \n I don't see that. Where?\n I'm sorry. It's  \n Not less. Right?\n Shall not shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then further down in the paragraph in the last in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency.\n But but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a factual disagreement here?\n I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think it's more of a characterization disagreement. There it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be to be turned over.\n It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable. And they could certainly for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior. Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.\n But but  \n So otherwise contractable sounds like a a statutory question.\n But it it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable. It says, including supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. It's talking about a limitation upon the contractability of functions  \n Correct.\n not the use of funds.\n Well, it's talking about both because the the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds. It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes. And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions.\n But how do you how do you square that with the on page 14a reductions and, as Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions.\n Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section. And our view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal functions were never required to be transferred under subsection (a) to begin with. And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.\n So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and noninherent?\n Oh, absolutely there are. The Federal functions is the broader set of it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform. And the distinction between inherent Federal functions and Federal functions, although it might seem trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal functions.\n Does it ever define them as noncontractable? I mean, I I your answer, I suppose, is well, what what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to  \n It it does.\n the point of contractability?\n It does, Justice Scalia Justice Souter. Excuse me.\n Thank you, but apologize to him. (Laughter.)\n And we describe the the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31. When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance. There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal. And I think what that signifies is that there are some functions that are not contractable and can't be turned over to the tribes.\n That that all may be true, of course. They're talking about don't contract out to the Indians something that should be done in Washington. But what has that got to do with the issue? We're talking, I thought, about about Government contracts. People who enter into Government contracts need certainty. They have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract. And a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that. And under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount. Okay? That's the principle. And  \n You don't think  \n and I don't see anything contrary to that.\n Justice Breyer, one background principle and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves. One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes. And the contracts  \n Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and the tribes did somehow contract away Federal inherent Federal functions?\n No. They specifically  \n They didn't violate that section, did they? The contracts that we're talking about.\n They specifically did not transfer  \n No. So we're not dealing with that. We're dealing with contracts that didn't violate that section. And you're just saying that some of the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that the contracts violated that provision.\n No. The that's correct, Justice O'Connor. What I'm responding to is the suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be diverted to pay for the indirect costs  \n You're not saying you're addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are available.\n Correct.\n That's where your argument is going.\n Correct. It relates to the funds that are available. And the tribes' position  \n And you rely on the statement in (a) that the the only funds that are available are funds that include funds to to pay for supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.\n Right. Not funds  \n And not funds that are used to pay for administrative functions that are not contractable.\n Right. We think that funds for inherent Federal functions were taken off off the  \n Can I  \n You said that  \n Can I ask you sort of a basic question that I'm having trouble following? As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?\n Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.\n But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.\n In in part it was mandated by the statute.\n In part but not in whole.\n Perhaps not in whole  \n Well, that's the point.\n but at least in significant part. And let me but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated. The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built. And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute. And that I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.\n Is the is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?\n It was I I think in principal part it was mandated by the by  \n Principal part, but  \n Well, let  \n Does that mean that there was not enough?\n At least as far  \n They could have made it 97 percent  \n insofar as what I've said with respect  \n and had enough money  \n Sorry.\n to pay these contract obligations.\n No, Justice Stevens.\n See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.\n No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that. And that's what I'm trying to explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in in Congress' appropriation committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.\n Are you telling me that the committee reports are are binding law?\n They're not binding law, Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.\n No. But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements. And in in that conflict, I don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.\n It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract.\n And and their their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the that the nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying I think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed. Yes. And if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what they're saying.\n That is what they're saying, Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy. There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.\n No, he's not. But if if where I'm really coming from, to be honest and I'd like you might as well reply to what I'm actually is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions. (Laughter.)\n I I read here look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes. And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. So if they're saying that money from a contract point a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.\n Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.\n Well, there is is the kind the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another. What did they think?\n No. They thought the the board the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the Board of Contract Appeals, thought  \n Well, I'm thinking the Board of Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.\n Well, I don't think the Board of of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from. They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient. Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with. But even if you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core Federal function  \n No, but if that's true, then everything then every penny in the in the IHS bureaucracy qualifies. I mean, that swallows the that swallows the entire budget.\n Well, let's Justice Souter, if I if I could, let's look at the particular sources  \n No, no. But I mean, just conceptually isn't that isn't that the the implication of what you're saying?\n You you can't limit it to inherent Government functions. Both the inherent and the noninherent Government functions would fall within this provision  \n Yes.\n if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.\n Well, I I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe. With respect to the administrative support  \n On on that point on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full. And he said, I asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell the court what programs existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?\n I don't I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.\n Now, what does that mean?\n So  \n I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs. Are we talking just about existing programs that that the Government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government is at liberty to benefit tribes? And so what if the contract support costs are, as a result, diminished? We're still doing good for tribes.\n We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes. And again, one of the new facilities  \n It's strange to talk of reducing is is not required to reduce funding for a new program. I mean, for a new program, there isn't any funding. How can you reduce the funding for a new program?\n Because  \n That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.\n Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases. And one way to see that is 25 U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year. So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount.\n Mr. Srinivasan, you you alluded a moment ago in in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs. Did those declarations get specific in the way that her original question was was asking about? Did it say did the declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe and so on, or was it did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?\n Well, they they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example. I think the one example that they give and maybe there are more is is a diabetes program. But I think it's more the general principle  \n Was that a new program or an existing program?\n That's an the the particular example is an existing program. But I think it's more  \n It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.\n You're you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?\n Yes. It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the as the the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.\n Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.\n Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.\n Is there some way to avoid these problems now? Has anything changed?\n Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.\n Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?\n I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to to divert the entire amount of administrative support for for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years. Thank you.\n Mr. Miller, you have about 4 minutes left.\n Justice Stevens, thank you. First, I'd like to address the availability of appropriations clause briefly. That is a term of art with a well-established meaning. This Court in Morissette said that if unless there's a contrary direction from Congress that the term of art should not be given its well-established meaning, it controls. And that is the meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation is available for the purpose during the time and in the amounts necessary to fully  \n I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.\n Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.\n Thank you, Mr. Miller.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether, 42 years after this Court decided in Douglas v. California that indigent defendants have the right to the assistance of counsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal  \n Well, now, Douglas didn't involve a guilty plea, I guess.\n It did not, Your Honor. It was a trial case.\n And did the Court say anything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea? I guess it didn't.\n It did not. None of this Court's cases in the Douglas line have turned on whether the conviction was by trial or by plea.\n Does that make a difference or could it?\n I don't believe it does, Your Honor, because as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea. Of course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases this Court well knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines very complicated issues of sentencing law arise. And now Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps more complicated than the Federal system that's been in effect since the 1980's.\n Did did your client waive any right to appeal here in connection with the proceedings of the plea?\n He did not waive a right to file an application for leave to appeal. Because of the  \n What did he waive?\n He waived the right to have a to have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in other words, the right to automatically have full briefing and oral argument. So what he agreed to by pleading was to go through the application for leave to appeal procedure which involves a preliminary determination of merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.\n Why didn't he waive the right to have counsel for that for that purpose since that was the law in Michigan?\n Well, he did not first of all, as a matter of fact, he did not. He was never told at any point during the plea proceedings that he would be giving up his right to counsel.\n Well, he was told what what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.\n He was told that under certain circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.\n Right.\n But the judge never said, under any other circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.\n Well, isn't that a perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and B, that C and D might have been that C and D will not be given?\n It might be a natural inference for somebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbert is a special education student, functionally illiterate. And nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his right to counsel.\n Well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?\n I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy, because this is a case in which the State is making a waiver argument. And, of course, the waiver argument is not part of is not the intent of the statute. What the statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't be getting counsel.\n Well, I I take it you would challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were advised?\n Absolutely.\n And even if he said, I hereby waive?\n Absolutely, we would because that is a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor. That waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible for appointed counsel on appeal. So that waiver has no effect whatsoever on  \n Well, wouldn't I'm I'm sorry.\n It would have no effect whatsoever on money defendants I'm saying.\n Wouldn't your position be different if he had been advised that he had exactly the right that you claim he has, and the court said, however, in Michigan you may not enter the the plea unless you waive that right? If if you don't want to waive that right, which I've just explained to you, we'll we'll have a trial. Would would your answer still be that that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?\n The waiver would be unconstitutional under those conditions because it is a discriminatory waiver. To show how breathtaking the State's argument  \n How why is that prejudicial to him? He says, okay, I can't plead guilty. I really did it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.\n I'm sorry.\n Why doesn't he just have a trial? He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.\n Well, as this Court has long recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit. I mean, excuse me. A guilty plea provides very substantial benefits. And so the effect of the Michigan statute then would be only the money defendant can receive the benefits of a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors corrected.\n Now, is that what you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's that it's far-reaching.\n Yes. Well, not only that, if the State's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have free transcripts. You can't have the waiver of the filing fees. In fact, the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have counsel at sentencing.\n These are all disparate impact arguments. There's there's you're not making any argument that the State intentionally discriminates against the poor. You're just saying the effect of this is harder on the poor than it is on the rich. But I thought our our equal protection cases have have said that disparate impact doesn't doesn't hack it as far as equal protection is concerned.\n Well, Justice Scalia, I actually have two responses to that. First, this is intentionally aimed at the poor. Looking at 770.3a, the statute under in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent. It refers to the indigent. So this is a statute that on its face is is taking away the right of the indigent and only the indigent to have have an attorney. So I don't agree that is is a simply a disparate impact case. But in the context of appellate counsel for a first-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have have not applied the same line of analysis that this Court has applied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear most recently in the MLB case  \n In any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it  \n Yes.\n it is not a disparate impact case at all  \n Yes.\n because it affects only indigents.\n Yes. There is no question that this statute was enacted for and specifically applies only to the indigent. It has it has no impact whatsoever on the wealthy, and it's aimed at the at the indigent only. So I do I do not agree that this  \n Whenever a State has has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor? That that seems to be an extraordinary proposition. The State isn't picking on the poor. It's just saying that that the the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this in this one instance of guilty pleas. And and you say that that is intentional discrimination against the poor?\n It's not a a disparate impact claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor. The statute was designed to take away counsel from the poor and only from the poor.\n So any cutback on benefits that is given on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.\n I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.\n Just this one because that's your case.\n This case certainly is.\n You're saying this is case like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal.\n Yes.\n You're bracketing  \n This case in many ways the restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to appeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse than those that were struck down in Douglas because at least in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues. We don't even have that here. All we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript. Under the Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts, his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily be done by counsel. And so  \n May I just understand one point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me? In your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?\n Oh, it's my it's certainly my contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-tier direct felony appeal on the merits.\n So that ultimately your case rests not on equal protection but due process.\n It's a merger of both principles, as this Court said  \n But it's one as much as the other, isn't it?\n Yes.\n I mean, you're we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel.\n Yes, Justice Souter.\n So you're you're retracting the pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want to do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as as directed against the poor.\n It is directed  \n Or not?\n It is directed against the poor, which is why there is an equal protection component to this argument, but this Court's cases  \n But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.\n I believe that's right. It's it's difficult I have to confess, Your Honor, it's difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and equal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line, and this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a certain merger. Also, I believe in Smith v. Robbins this Court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the lines in these cases. But  \n You're you're saying that the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of merely providing counsel as a matter of grace. That's what due process does for you. Because they have to provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have a very clear equal protection case which you would not otherwise have. Isn't isn't that the way the two work together?\n I think that's right, Justice Souter. I think I agree with that.\n Can in your view, can the State require a waiver of the right to appeal for everyone?\n That's a question this Court hasn't decided, and I don't have a position on that. But that's far different from this case because that would not be discriminatory.\n Well, I'm not so sure. It certainly goes to the importance or the significance of the underlying right. My understanding is correct me if I'm wrong that in the Federal system, we require waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence is calculated, as I understand it.\n Yes.\n And do you question the lawfulness of that?\n I don't. And that that case has not come before this Court yet, and so I don't know how this Court would decide that case if it comes. I know some of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellate waivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea. One thing the Michigan statute is does is it takes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents without negotiation. It's it's the baseline.\n But, Mr. Moran, if if you're if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal. Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal. If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.\n But, Your Honor, the problem is is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor.\n That's an equal protection claim.\n That's an equal protection claim.\n But you've you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim. If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver, then apart from the from the dispute in this case as to whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur, there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal protection claim.\n I'm really not sure that you can separate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment again, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know this Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that there is there is a component of both. And it's precisely because of these sorts of questions that I think you have to view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the Griffin/Douglas line.\n In any case  \n Where where do we find the waiver here? Is it in the joint appendix?\n Well, it's my position there was no waiver, but the  \n But you referred to something that was waived.\n Yes.\n Where would we find that?\n Well, the plea proceeding. It's the plea proceeding. And it's  \n Well, don't take your time to look it up. Maybe counsel for respondent can find it for us.\n It's it's in the joint appendix  \n All right.\n beginning on page 19.\n It's their argument anyway. Let them  \n I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a a right to have a counsel on appeal. He can waive a trial. He can waive a jury trial. But before he has to before he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional right to a jury trial.\n That's right.\n And why wouldn't he also have to have the to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?\n Well, that's my position Justice\n All right. That has nothing to do with equal protection. It has to do simply with a very common sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial, et cetera. So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has a right to a lawyer. Now, if he wants to go back and waive that right, fine.\n That's right.\n That's all. That's the end of it.\n That's right.\n So what's all this complicated thing about?\n If an indigent, after being sentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to go on appeal by myself, which is actually a a right this Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to represent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent is allowed to would be allowed to represent himself or herself on appeal if they chose to do so. The problem here is that the statute purports to take away the right, and it's our position that this is a  \n No, no. You'd have to say the statute is wrong in taking away the right.\n Yes.\n But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right.\n That's right. We have no problem with a voluntary waiver. We certainly have a problem with a forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea which produces tremendous benefits in Michigan, as everywhere else, unless unless you agree to waiver  \n Oh, but but that happens all the time. I mean, the waiver waiver of appeal in in guilty in guilty pleas. That's that's not permissible either?\n I take no position on that. It may or may not permissible.\n Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made.\n But it's far different because that's something that can be obtained in negotiation. But what we would have  \n Well, Mr. Moran, here on page 22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the defendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea, you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right.\n Yes.\n And you think that was not effective?\n No. That was effective. That that's referring to the automatic appeal that he would have if he went to trial where he would have full briefing and oral argument. The Michigan  \n Well, I it doesn't say that.\n No, it doesn't. This was a this was a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of of respects, but it  \n Well, he does  \n I'm  \n he does go on to say that that he can appoint a lawyer for in certain instances. He doesn't complete the explanation by saying there are other instances and when I will not appoint one. That he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.\n Yes, he was.\n He had a counsel at the plea hearing.\n He did.\n I'm mixed up again. What is the answer to this? I I would have thought that even if those words that Justice O'Connor read referred directly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us in other words, the one that's at issue that still he'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that appeal before he could waive it.\n Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree.\n And does anybody dispute that?\n I believe  \n Is that at issue here?\n I I believe the State might dispute that. I'm not sure. What the Michigan constitution does, Justice O'Connor, if I may come back to your question, is it says that for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, they are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, and they have they then have to proceed by the application for leave to appeal. And so the Michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method. And so Michigan's appeal, after a guilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several other States, Virginia, West Virginia, and and several other States have guilty plea appeals.\n That's a strange terminology. It doesn't provide a right to appeal. It it provides a right to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an appeal. A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to get an appeal.\n It's framed in terms of a of a right. Page 2 of the brief  \n So you have an absolute right to ask for an appeal.\n Yes.\n But that's not a right to appeal. It's a right to request an appeal, which can be granted or denied.\n Yes.\n Okay.\n But it's a it's what Michigan has done is it has changed the method of the appeal. And so Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by petition. West Virginia has a first-tier by petition and  \n Well, it's done more than change the method. It's changed the entitlement. The court can simply say we're not interested in your appeal. It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.\n Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not how the the Michigan Court of Appeals works. The Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And so in Mr. Halbert's case, the Michigan Court of Appeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to to identify his issues, with an order saying that there was a lack of merit in the grounds presented. That is a preclusive decision on the merits of his case. That  \n That's just but that's just boiler plate, isn't it? That's what they say in all these cases.\n Yes.\n And I think Michigan cites a Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the merits.\n That  \n It's People v. Berry?\n Yes. That was a decision of the Michigan Supreme Court referring to its own orders denying applications for leave to appeal which are not on the merits. The Michigan Supreme Court denies the applications for saying by saying, we are not persuaded that we should hear the questions presented.\n Well, why wouldn't it be the same if the if it's a discretionary appeal at the intermediate appellate level?\n Because the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-correcting court. And so it issues orders saying denied for lack of merit. And the Michigan Court of Appeals dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said, without exception, that is a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.\n Didn't didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case was that the name of it?\n Yes.\n Didn't it say that the that the intermediate court's denial of of appeals was a discretionary judgment?\n It called it a discretionary appeal, Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And in fact, the very author of the  \n That was a dissent, though.\n That's right, but the very author of the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year later or 2 years later describes the effect of of an order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and rejected the merits.\n So, in effect, it's discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom line, whether they give it full dress or or merely discretionary denial is is an implication on the merits.\n Yes, exactly as in Virginia. In Jackson v. Virginia, the Court recognized that the the Virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a petition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and that each petition is considered on the merits, and a denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine. And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now is exactly like the one in Virginia.\n Is that something the intermediate appellate court has said? Have they said that, that we have a a discretionary appeal, but every in every case it's a merits decision? We don't have any decisions that say we are exercising our discretion not to review.\n If a if a appeal or an application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect, then the court will occasionally issue an order denying the application for that reason. But for any properly filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding practice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.\n This means, I would presume, that that we would we would have to give our Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all on the merits.\n And they do.\n Federal courts do?\n Yes.\n They assume that all factual and legal arguments have been decided against the the person applying for a discretionary appeal?\n Yes. After Abela v. Martin in the Sixth Circuit. And there is a a whole host of Federal district court decisions in the Eastern and Western District of Michigan all saying that when an order is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the AEDPA standard of review applies. And so the State obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so the State very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite what it says because they are hoping that this Court will conclude that it is a discretionary appeal. In fact, the State  \n Mr. Moran.\n has made an even more radical argument in its brief. The State maintains that the appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the to the actual function of that court because there is a provision that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case, after sentencing, that there are issues that she should have raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and then the application that follows after that to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal. I'll just point out that even the State's amicus doesn't agree with that, and and rightfully so in light of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.\n Mr. Moran, before your your time is up, I did want to know what is your position on let's say that there is you prevail and there is a right to counsel for these applications to appeal. And if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the equivalent of an Anders brief?\n Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, I have done that personally. Before I became an academic, I worked at the State Appellate Defender Office in Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on plea appeals. And in a significant percentage of the cases I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my head after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining, at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be filed or or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of an Anders brief. And so that is done in a number of cases. It is our position that that procedure actually helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr. Halbert, a special education student with mental disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall and filing, in in his case, with the help of a fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is completely incoherent, misses several issues that are right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that his sentencing guidelines were misscored but but without explaining why, without even identifying which sentencing guidelines were misscored. And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that was approximately three times too high under the sentencing guidelines. The State concedes that one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor erroneously. We concede one of the one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in Mr. Halbert's favor erroneously. But then there were two others, and the most important ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13. That was scored for 25 points in both cases. And so Mr. Mr. Halbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too high. Michigan requires Michigan is one of the few States that requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost. And so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing, which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still available to be called, all from prison, and there was no possible way he could do that. So it's not very surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate, that his application for leave to appeal was completely incoherent. The fellow inmate actually did write the the trial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel. But under the statute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion. Under the statute, only if there was already an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, only then would the judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course, the guidelines, as misscored without objection from defense counsel there was no upward departure at that point. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n Very well, Mr. Moran. Mr. Restuccia.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to start with the factual claim regarding the waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 from the joint appendix, being the point at which Mr. Halbert, in fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellate counsel. I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that he was told specifically it's under these conditions you'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you might be appointed counsel. From context it's unambiguous that he would otherwise not receive counsel. And what's important is at the joint appendix on page 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding on this point. So in order for this Court to conclude that Mr. Halbert did not waive his right to appellate counsel under the particular circumstances, you would have you would have to conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its factual finding.\n Well, I mean, wouldn't we have to conclude that if we're going to apply the same standards here that we usually do in in the plea waiver situation? I mean, we the the classic point of it all is the knowing the the intelligent, voluntary waiver of a known right. And leaving aside the equal protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I don't see that there would be have been an adequate waiver here because he was never told that he had the right that he now claims as a matter of due process. You indeed, dispute it.\n Yes.\n But unless he were told that, the the waiver that that depends upon parsing the difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate for a waiver of a known right.\n I I think that the colloquy makes clear that he does not he's not going to have an appeal as of right, and then when told that  \n Well, the the appeal of his right the appeal as of right point, as I understand it, is a different point. What they're getting at there is it will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you ask for it. We're here dealing with the right to counsel, and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it, that there wouldn't be a an an adequate waiver under Boykin.\n I think in in context when told that only under these circumstances you're going to receive counsel in bringing discretionary application, that it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go forward with the his plea  \n Look, the imagine I'm just repeating what Justice Souter said. There must be it's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but I haven't heard the answer. He knows Michigan law or his lawyer does. The Michigan lawyer looks at the statute. It says a defendant who pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review with some exceptions, which they claim are inadequate. So he thinks the law is shall not. I have no right. So he doesn't not only not only is he not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to waive. He has no such right. Now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to waive, how could he waive anything? And obviously, a person who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal no matter what and then he says, okay, I waive my right to appeal, I mean, really.\n I think that the the for the two questions that are asked, he explains the court explained to him he didn't have appeal as of right but then said  \n Okay, that's the end of it. Right?\n But then and then the the  \n But he had an appeal of right until he pleaded guilty.\n That's right.\n And that's where that's what the waiver consists of. To say he didn't have an appeal of right, no. That's he had an appeal of right up until the point where he pleads guilty, and that's what and that's what the judge is asking.\n Precisely.\n Do you want to do you want to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll get you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances.\n Precisely.\n The court didn't say only  \n And that's what we're deciding is  \n That's the problem.\n That's exactly the issue in front of us. Is it constitutional or not constitutional? And waiver has nothing to do with it.\n I think that I also want to make the point, of course, that there was a factual finding, so if this Court did conclude, it would have to find the trial court was clearly erroneous. The  \n Mr. Restuccia, the we are dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. It said only when if this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. And I was curious as a matter of what is going on in Michigan trial courts now. Do judges routinely tell defendants who plead guilty tell them not only when the court must give them counsel, but if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal? Because that  \n Yes.\n that was never imparted in this case.\n The advice concerning right to appeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was a form from 2000. The the 2004 form is available from the Michigan Supreme Court web site, and it has been modified now that because the trial court it seems apparent that he was reading from the advice concerning right of to appeal. The way it reads now is it will say you are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at public expense to assist you in filing an application for leave to appeal. So this this the colloquy now would happen differently, but I think that  \n Of course, your case is a little stronger than than the court just asked just saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I must appoint counsel in another circumstance. That might have left open the implication that you could appoint counsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and to say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I might appoint counsel in the other circumstance. So if there's any implication from it, the implication is not just that I have I have listed all the areas in which I must, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I either must or even may, if there's an implication.\n I think I think that's right.\n Well, apparently the people who who redid the model instructions thought that this would be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get counsel if you don't fit under these exceptions.\n That's right. And they they did they did modify the form. So on the question of the underlying constitutionality, I want to I want to make a few points, that the the threshold question really is whether there's an appeal as of right in Michigan for a plea-based conviction. Michigan law is clear that there is no appeal by right. It's an application process and it's a discretionary review. The Michigan Court of Appeals has no obligation to correct errors in these cases, has no obligation to review the merits.\n Do you agree with your opponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the intermediate decision as a decision on the merits?\n No. The law in the Sixth Circuit is in fact in conflict with a case an earlier case, McKenzie v. Smith had determined that the a decision with that language, that virtually identical language, is not is not entitled to deference.\n So your opponent has misrepresented Michigan law.\n No. I didn't say I wasn't suggesting that. Abela is one case stating one position. McKenzie, an earlier case, stated another position.\n But he says there are dozens of cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA in the way he described. Is that wrong?\n Well, he didn't cite those cases. I  \n No, he didn't, but do you think he's wrong?\n I I know that our office handles all the habeas habeas corpus  \n Do you think he's wrong?\n I think he is wrong. The  \n Are you going on on record as saying that Michigan does not and will not, in the United States courts, claim any AEDPA deference as a result of one of these determinations?\n The Solicitor General made that position clear before the argument before this Court in Tesmer v. Kowalski. So we have not been advancing that claim. In fact, we've been advancing a claim  \n And you have not been and and Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in the district courts?\n The all the habeas petitions are run through the office of the Attorney General, so that the when the Solicitor General from the State of Michigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim, that means all habeas cases in Michigan essentially there will be that argument will not be advanced.\n So, so far as you can tell, that's the way it's been.\n That's right. That's right. And because there is no appeal as of right under Michigan law, this the Douglas case doesn't govern the disposition. Ultimately the the controlling is Ross. And the issue then is whether Michigan provides a meaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to bring an application for leave. That's really the I think the heart of the constitutional issue. There are three distinct characteristics of the Michigan system. The the nature of the review is discretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of review in Ross that was described by this Court for the North Carolina Supreme Court. Mr. Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. With regard to applications for leave where there is no right to have the merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court. In fact, one of the reasons for the legislation in Michigan, the reason the Michigan constitution was changed was because of the heavy volume that the Michigan Court of Appeals was facing. There are 28 judges in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and they produce  \n Do they all sit together?\n No. They're panels of three. They issue about 4,000 opinions each year. So each judge is responsible for authoring  \n But it's just one court.\n One court. That's right. So each judge is responsible for authoring between 130-140 opinions, having to join in another 280. So resource allocation is one of the pressing concerns in the Michigan Court of Appeals. The situations in which the court of appeals will grant leave on application are rare. It's it's reluctant to grant leave in these cases in part because of the  \n Then why if it's just denying or not granting appeal, why does it use the boiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?\n It's used that standard order for the last 20 years or longer. The only Michigan Court of Appeals case in only published case in an application for leave setting is the Bobenal case cited by the people in our the State of Michigan in its brief, in which the Michigan Court of Appeals said there is no this is not a determination on the merits. The only published case for Michigan in which there was an application for leave from a plea-based conviction is People v. Berry in which the Michigan Court of Appeals, after initially having denied leave, then in a collateral attack granted leave on the very same issue and said that its original  \n Why sorry. Finish. I just had a I wanted to go back to something you said, but I want you to be finished.\n Could I ask about grounds presented before we get off this? Is it conceivable that the lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of merit in the in the grounds of application? Is is the applicant required to state why this particular appeal is worthy of being entertained?\n They're supposed to raise those arguments. I think that's exactly right, that merits can have different meanings, and it can it can relate to whether it would justify the resources of the court to examine the underlying merits of the claim. I think that's right. That's one understanding of the of the order that's consistent with the way it's been treated by the court of appeals and also, most importantly, by the Michigan constitution, when the people of the State of Michigan said trial-based convictions, there's an appeal as of right. For all other convictions, for plea-based convictions, it would be by leave. The Michigan's Supreme Court, in examining this very question about the nature of review, said that it was discretionary.\n What of Mr. Mr. Moran's point that this whatever the merits are, it counts as law of the case and it's it conclusively determines the issues presented?\n That's not what happened in in People in the Bobenal case, which was a court of appeals published decision where the order read virtually identical identically to this one, and the court of appeals said it could would not be bound by its original denial of leave for the lack of merits on the grounds presented and reached the merits of the claim. The same thing happened in in the Berry case in which  \n Well, that was the same court, though, wasn't it?\n Right.\n But what what about preclusion on other courts?\n The  \n In litigation in other courts. They did did they ever say there is no claim or issue preclusion in other courts as a result of of our denials?\n The court of appeals was only examining its effect on itself, and wasn't examining on subsequent courts.\n And any any court, I mean, in in theory, can can revise its own its own opinions. But the I mean, we look to preclusion really on on the effect of the judgment in another court, and I take it they have not ruled on that.\n Well, but both both opinions, in Bobenal and Berry, the court said it was not a ruling on the merits. In other words, if a subsequent court then said it was a merits determination, it would be inconsistent with the holding from Bobenal and it would be inconsistent with Berry with saying the merits have not been reached.\n And they have said the same, you tell us, as to Federal courts.\n Right. The Federal courts have  \n I mean, that's another court, and and they are not asserting that they've decided on the merits in Federal court.\n The Federal courts have been ambiguous. In other words, the Abela case they said  \n I'm not talking about what the Federal courts have said. I'm talking about what what Michigan has said and and what the court of has the court of appeals spoken on that subject?\n Yes. The court of appeals in the Bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually the identical language of the issue raised here, that this was not a decision on the merits and that it was not itself bound as law of the case because the merits had not been resolved. I think the Bulger case is kind of the paramount case because it is the Michigan Supreme Court conferring the proper legal understanding of the applications for leave, and it said that the nature of the leave is discretionary. I think that fits with common sense understanding because there is no right to have the merits reviewed. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the application were discretionary if a defendant would have a claim to have any error corrected. Otherwise, he would have a claim on the court of appeals. The court of appeals has full authority to make the determination that even if everything alleged is true, it's not going to correct the error.\n Look, this is what I'm I'm interested in. It seems like Michigan is unique here. Why not do, if you're worried about resources, what other States have done? You just say, okay, of course, you have a right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer. We'll give it to you if you're poor. But, by the way, if you want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that deal unless you waive it.\n Well, I think that, in a way, Michigan provides a a greater protection by enabling itself. What the court of appeals is essentially doing with its review is for the for a case where there's a an an egregious set of facts, it can reach in and grant an application and review it on the merits. It's a it's it's a kind of a determination about resource allocation, making kind of the hard choices about policy decisions that States have to make.\n Is this a case where it would meet the standard for granting leave to appeal?\n No. This for for Mr. Halbert  \n Because of the error in scoring?\n In fact, anyone who's very familiar with the Michigan guideline system would recognize that Mr. Halbert, if anything, received a break in the scoring of the guidelines. That that ultimately the Offense Variable 13 is a very easy answer to why it was properly scored.\n You take the position that in fact there was no error in scoring.\n No. The there was no error in scoring. The Offense Variable 13 claim relates to three whether the defendant had committed three three offenses against a person within the within 5 years. Michigan allows a determination based on preponderance even if there was no conviction entered. Mr. Halbert was a serial child molester who admitted to having sexually assaulted his 14-year-old stepdaughter, a 10-year-old girl, a 6-year-old girl. All that information was in the presentence investigation report. There was no objection to the scoring of Offense Variable 13 because he admitted to the sexual assaults. There was it was never raised  \n I thought at page 36 of your brief that you agreed that he made a correct that there was an error in of application.\n Right. The Offense Variable 9 was there was an error with respect to that, but it wouldn't affect the ultimate position he would be placed in the in the brackets. In fact, the only error that did occur that would have affected the scoring was one in his favor, which would have put him put him in a higher bracket. So he in fact  \n So there were at least two errors. How they balance out I guess is your view they didn't hurt him at all.\n Well, in fact, if anything, helped him. But on a more basic level  \n Is that correct? There were two errors in the  \n Yes.\n at least.\n Yes.\n And he contends there were two more, and that hasn't been resolved.\n That's that's right, but I I think those claims are  \n So at at least we have to assume that it was not an error-free sentencing proceeding.\n Yes. Well, more importantly, the kinds of issues at play for the sentencing cases are all like this. They they relate to the minimum sentencing. Michigan systems then determine from a maximum from a minimum to a maximum which will get a a range of time. All the these sentencing guideline cases relate to the minimum sentence. For Mr. Halbert as a sex offender, this is really a question about when he will be eligible for release from the Department of Corrections. He's going to be facing 30 years because all the sentences in Michigan are set by the statute. So these oral arguments relating lesser liberty  \n May I ask another question? Am I correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43 of the joint appendix that even though there were lots of errors there, the fact that they were not raised until after December 11th would have precluded review at the trial court level?\n No. His the point of the trial court there was that the defendant, if he wanted to withdraw his plea, should have raised that before the sentencing itself because the court has discretion before sentencing to let him out of his plea. After sentencing, he has to show that the plea was invalid. So his time he was untimely trying to withdraw his plea because he was concerned about consecutive as against concurrent sentences. In in summary, the the Michigan system the with the limited date to the review and the kinds of issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue are not are lesser liberty interest questions because they have to do with amount of punishment. The Michigan system extends the relationship of trial counsel to the defendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions regarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to have a factual record from which to advance his claims. He's not left to shift for himself, that there is a counsel appointed to identify those meritorious claims  \n But if the counsel happens to be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.\n And that's always the circumstance for a defendant who's bringing a discretionary application where his prior counsel was ineffective, that he can be left to identify the meritorious claims on his own and to make the argument of ineffective assistance of counsel. That's true in Ross as well where your first where your first appeal as of right, your your appellate counsel is incompetent. You're going to be left to identify those meritorious claims, raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, and to try to avoid procedural bars that you'll be facing. Every system is going to have to draw that line and to say that at some point you're not going to get appointed another attorney. Just because there's access to the system doesn't mean there always has to be another attorney appointed. Otherwise, the point is that you would have to have two attorneys make a review on your case, whereas there is no right to an appeal here that this Court has recognized that ultimately where there since there is no right to appeal, that he had an opportunity to have a trial counsel  \n But, of course, if he had had paid counsel, he would not have had these handicaps.\n That's right, that the there is some advantage, but that's not the ultimate answer.\n Competent paid counsel.\n Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Restuccia. Mr. Schaerr, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Like the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of this Michigan statute in the Tesmer case, petitioner's attempt to invalidate that statute here runs counter to this Court's longstanding tradition of deference to the people of the individual States and to their legislatures in the design and implementation of their criminal justice systems. As the Court said in Coleman v. Thompson, a case like this is a case about federalism because it involves the respect that Federal courts must pay to States and the States' procedural rules. Respect for the State's choices is especially important here because, as the Court put it in Medina v. California, preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government. And therefore, the Court said we should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States. And and as to the question of of when to provide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded us in Murray v. Giarratano, that's a choice that should be one of legislative choice, especially since it involves difficult policy considerations and the allocation of scarce legal resources.\n Now, I take it that the basic rule that we've followed and this is what people are arguing about could be a criminal trial or proceeding, plea, something in a trial court.\n Right.\n It emerges with a judgment, and then there is going to be the first review. Call it a leave to appeal, call it an appeal, call it whatever you want, but it is the first review. And in those two instances, State, if the defendant is poor, give him a lawyer. That's simple. That's clear. Everybody could understand it. They may not even have a lot of legal arguments. Now, what significant what does that prevent a State from doing that it's reasonably important for a State to want to do?\n Well, again, Justice Breyer, it's a question of allocating scarce legal resources. If you and this case is a perfect example of that. This case is not does not involve an appeal as of right. It involves a discretionary appeal, and and that's the vast bulk of of appeals that are addressed by the by the Michigan Court of Appeals. So if you impose here on the State of Michigan an obligation to provide counsel in all of those cases, you are, in essence, forcing the people of Michigan to reallocate their legal resources away from other cases or you're requiring the legislature to increase taxes to pay for that to pay for that  \n Is there any other State that's done it the way Michigan has?\n I don't believe there's another State that's done it exactly the same way. But I but I would point out and I think this is important, Justice Breyer that that at least according to the Michigan Supreme Court in the Bulger case, the majority of States don't allow any appeal at all from a plea-based conviction. 21 of them rule it out entirely and expressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals from plea-based convictions by by allowing prosecutors to impose that impose a waiver as a condition of entering into a plea. So so the relevant universe for comparison is quite small here. It's really 12 States at most, and and Michigan sort of fits within the middle of those States in terms of the amount of resources that it provides and opportunities that it provides.\n Are you saying I just want to be clear that even if this defendant had had paid counsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the intermediate court?\n That's correct. It it's discretionary, and that's clear not just not just from analysis of the of the Michigan courts' opinions, but from the provision of the of but from the constitutional provision that that created this entire controversy, which was added in 1994. It's article I, section 20. And that constitutional provision itself draws a sharp distinction between appeals of right and appeals by leave of court. So even if the Michigan courts wanted to have a system of of mandatory appeals, they're now precluded by the Michigan constitution from doing that. And so and so clearly, if this Court adheres to the sharp distinction and which I think is equally sharp and clear, that this Court has made between between appeals of right and discretionary appeals  \n But it's not that it's not that sharp because it was in Ross, it was the second appeal. So here we have one factor that is like Douglas, Griffin, and one factor that's like Ross. You can't say that it falls in one camp more than the other. This is the first-tier appeal.\n I I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but but that's not the distinction that I understand this Court's decisions draw. Several times since Douglas and Ross, this Court has said that the right to paid counsel addressed in Douglas extends only to the first appeal of right and no further. And that's that's Coleman and and Finley, among others.\n Of course, the question is whether the words, of right, were essential to that statement.\n I I'm assuming that the Court was being careful in its in its choice of words, and I believe it was because that that  \n Because then it wouldn't have needed to include the word first.\n I'm sorry?\n But then the word first was redundant, not the words, of right.\n No, I don't  \n You can have two appeals of right  \n That's right.\n I suppose if you wanted to.\n That's right. Now, so so the real question here, with regard to the right to paid counsel, is does it make sense to extend what the Court did in Douglas to this new situation. We think it does not. This Court's decisions, Ross and Justice Kennedy's concurrence in in Murray, as I recall, draw draw a distinction between the removal of barriers that the State imposes to the exercise of litigation rights on the one hand and, on the other hand, subsidizing, affirmatively subsidizing litigation rights And and I think this Court's care in distinguishing between appeals of right and discretionary appeals reflects a desire to cabin Douglas and and to avoid any further excursions into the area of subsidies. And we think that's a we think that's we think that's good as a matter of policy for the Court to do that, for one thing  \n May may I ask you one thing lest we forget it? Is is your argument premised on the assumption that a refusal to hear an appeal is is not regarded as a determination on the merits and thus preclusive?\n No, I don't think so. I I think that helps the argument. But in fact, there are lots of discretionary appeals or discretionary appellate proceedings that that do result in decisions on the merits. This Court, for example, sometimes summarily affirms or reverses on cert, and the fact that the Court does that doesn't create  \n Well, we accept cert before we do that. I thought the question was that the denial of an application for appeal does not have any merits consequence. Wasn't that the question?\n Yes, yes.\n Does the denial of an application for appeal have any merits consequence?\n Well, as if if that's the question, I I would defer to to Michigan counsel  \n No. But I'm asking whether that's a premise of your argument because the consequences of your argument are going to be very different depending on whether that is the premise or whether it isn't, whether that premise is true or whether it isn't.\n I I think the distinction is is not necessarily whether the decisions are on the merits or not. I think the distinction is between appeals of right and and appeals that are discretionary.\n If it's always on the merits, it's an it's an appeal of right, it seems to me. How can you have a a discretionary appeal which always decides the merits of the case?\n Well, I in in fact, I don't think that's what happens in Michigan, and and I think the  \n So your the assumption of your argument is that it is not on the merits. I.e., it is not a merits determination if there's a denial and hence there is no preclusion.\n I I think that's true. Whether it's an assumption of the argument, I'm not I'm not so sure.\n You're talking about a piece of paper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals court, appeals court, please hear my appeal.\n Right.\n And then it lists a whole lot of reasons like a cert petition.\n Right.\n And those are likely to do with the merits of the case. I mean, they'll tell all the horrible things that went on. And the question is, is he going to have a lawyer to help him with that piece of paper or not?\n That's right.\n All right. Now now, it sounds to me just the kind of thing you'd write if you had an appeal on the merits too. No. It's even harder. Even harder. You've got to convince them to take it.\n It it is more difficult, but but the disparity between  \n So why draw that distinction? The piece of paper is the same, even harder to write, needs the lawyer as much, first chance he gets after the trial court. Why draw that distinction?\n Well, again, because because if you if you broaden the right to State-paid counsel, as as in Douglas, you're going to require States to to reallocate resources to that priority and away from other priorities. Also, if you if you subsidize litigation in the name of providing adequate access to courts or meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a lot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that standard. And also, if and this is particularly important here I think. If you require States to subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not required to provide in the first place, like the right to seek review of a of a plea-based conviction, then you give the States a strong incentive to cut back on or eliminate that right altogether. And and, you know, who knows? But perhaps that's what's going on in the in the trend in the States away from providing this right. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Schaerr. Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.\n Thank you. I have to begin by correcting several misstatements of fact and of Michigan law. First of all, Mr. Schaerr just said that only a dozen States, I believe, allow for appeals from guilty pleas. That's not correct. Every State in the United States currently allows for appeals from guilty plea pleas. The Bulger case did say that. They cited a  \n Appeals as of right?\n Not necessarily. As I cited in my brief, a number of States allow for applications or petitions from guilty pleas, but every State has a first- tier direct appeal from guilty pleas. The Bulger the Michigan Supreme Court in Bulger cited a an article from an Arizona Attorney magazine that was simply incorrect on that. Secondly, on the issue of what is the effect of a order denying leave to appeal for lack of merit on the grounds presented, the State continues to rely on McKenzie v. Smith, an earlier Sixth Circuit opinion, People v. Berry, and Bobenal v. Saginaw Investment. None of those cases uses the phrase, lack of merit on the grounds presented. That phrase does not appear in any of those three cases. The Berry and the Bobenal cases, those are Michigan Court of Appeals cases before 1981. Beginning in 1981, in a series of three cases, People v. Douglas, People v. Hayden, and People v. Wiley, the Michigan Court of Appeals held unambiguously that our orders denying applications or remand orders, in that case, for lack of merit on the grounds presented, was law of the case.\n What's the effect of the constitutional provision then?\n I'm sorry? I I don't  \n If that's so, what is the effect of the constitutional provision that Mr. Schaerr read?\n The Michigan constitutional provision? It changes the way in which guilty plea appeals proceed. Before 1994, there were other types of appeals that had to proceed by application for leave to appeal, primarily late appeals. If the appeal was filed too late, it had to proceed by application for leave to appeal. In 1994, as a result of the constitutional amendment, guilt plea appeals now have to proceed by application for leave to appeal. That's constitutional. We have no problem with that, and that is the method by which the caseload management problems have been solved. They have been solved.\n I I you you have the wrong one. I meant the one that said that applications to the court of appeals are are require leave to appeal. What's the effect of that?\n The I assume you're still referring to article I, section 20 of the Michigan constitution.\n Yes. It says that for the court of appeals, you need leave to appeal. I thought they were doing something there. What were they doing?\n They were saying that first-tier felony appeals in Michigan following pleas require leave of the court, require an application for leave to appeal, like late appeals from trial cases do. But all of those appeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive effect for law of the case purposes. And the Sixth Circuit specifically dealt with that in in the Abela case. McKenzie v. Smith never never mentions anything about the lack of merit in the grounds presented. The resource allocations point is simply that not all of these guilty plea appeals are lead to full argument and full briefing, and that's fine. Michigan can do that. But what Michigan cannot do, as a result of Ellis and Douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of the appeal, which is where the court has to decide is there merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for himself. And so in in Smith v. Robbins, this Court, specifically referring back to the Ellis case, said that the problem that the Court identified in Ellis and that became part of the constitutional minimum in Douglas, was that the old California procedure did not require I see my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n Thank you, Mr. Moran. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In this case, the Ninth Circuit violated AEDPA by reversing the California Supreme Court's decision affirming Payton's 1982 death sentence. The California Supreme Court applied the exact right case, namely Boyde v. California, in the very manner contemplated that by that decision when assessing Payton's claim that his jury misunderstood the court's instructions and, in particular, factor (k) so as to unconstitutionally preclude consideration of his mitigating evidence. The California Supreme Court's application of Boyde is precisely the type of good faith application of Federal constitutional law to which AEDPA demands deference. It is manifestly not objectively unreasonable, and this can be demonstrated in three aspects of the decision. The first is that the California Supreme Court recognized Boyde's specific holding that factor (k) facially comported with the Eighth Amendment. The second is  \n Well, I thought the holding was that factor (k), standing alone, does does not raise a does does not, standing alone, raise a question of reasonable probability of of misunderstanding or misapplication of the law. And that's not what they're claiming here. They're claiming here that there was something much more than (k) standing alone. As I understand it, they're claiming that the difference between this and Boyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is that the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that was in fact wrong and and continued to do so even after the court interrupted the argument and that the court never gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous statements of law that the prosecutor had made. So that's that's why they're they're saying this is not a Boyde situation.\n Your Honor, Boyde has two specific components to its decision, which is, first, what factor (k) means standing alone, and you need to resolve that issue, which California did, in deciding the impact of the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k). So that, first, you start from the premise, as the California Supreme Court did, in following Boyde, that factor (k) facially directed for consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence.\n Well, no, no. The the mitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered without a (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence about the the character of the individual prior to or at least up to the moment of the crime. So this is this is different kind of evidence, and I I mean, this is post-crime evidence. And and I don't see that that Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover this at all. It might be a it would be a a closer question if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument and the judge's failure to correct it. But even even without those elements, there would be a serious question whether Boyde covered this at all.\n Your Honor, the respectfully I disagree. I believe that the California Supreme Court correctly and and reasonably determined that Boyde's holding encompassed Payton's character mitigating Payton's mitigating character evidence because the holding in Boyde or the issue directly presented by Boyde was whether factor (k) limited consideration to circumstances related to the crime or allowed for non-crime related mitigating evidence in deciding the appropriate penalty.\n What do we make of the Chief Justice's clear statement, not once but twice, in Boyde? The prosecutor never suggested that background and character evidence could not be considered. So mustn't we take Boyde with that qualification when we have a case where the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this information could not be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor?\n No, Justice Ginsburg. First, you must assess factor (k) facially and that's what Boyde did. Then the next question is did the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k) mislead the jury to believe that they could no longer consider Payton's mitigating character evidence. And that would be the second component of Boyde which is a general test for assessing the reasonable likelihood a jury misunderstood the instructions in the context of the proceedings. And the particularly relevant and important inquiry in this case is the California Supreme Court's application of Boyde's reasonable likelihood test in the context of the proceedings.\n Well, do we take do we take the case on the assumption that the trial court erred in not giving a curative instruction and in saying, well, this is a matter for the attorneys to argue? You you don't argue about what a statute means. That's a question of law. You don't argue that. You can argue the facts, that it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's extenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you can interpret a lot of this. But it it seems to me that the trial judge does make a mistake when he says, well, well, this is for the this is for them to argue when the the point of the objection was that there was a misinterpretation of the instruction. That's a legal point.\n And that is a fact that was expressly considered by the California Supreme Court in appropriately applying Boyde's general test for whether the jury misunderstood the court's instructions and an instruction that facially called for consideration  \n Not that that the jury misunderstood the judge's instruction, that there was no instruction. I mean, the the picture that's given here is the defense attorney says, I can use this to mitigate. The prosecutor says this is not legitimate mitigating evidence, and he said that several times. And the judge said, well, you can both argue it, and the judge never instructed the jury. He left it to the prosecutors to argue the law to the jury and for the jury to make that legal determination. It it seems to me that that that is surely an error. Now, you could still say, well, even so, it was harmless. But but I don't think can there be any doubt when the judge tells the attorneys, you argue the law to the jury and let the jury decide what the law is?\n Yes. There there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not take the prosecutor's statements so as to preclude consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence because the prosecutor's statements cannot  \n Well, even even if even if that's argument is is on point, just taking your your response on its own terms, where do you get a reasonable likelihood?\n Because the prosecutor's statements cannot be construed in a vacuum. You have to look, as Boyde required and as California did, at the context of the entire proceedings. What we're here what the jury was doing in Payton was deciding whether Payton should live or die, the sentencing determination.\n Well, but let's get specific. You you said there isn't a reasonable possibility. Why? Get get down to facts. Why isn't there a reasonable possibility?\n Why there is not a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood?\n Yes. The prosecutor stands there and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and after the judge interrupts him says, you cannot legally consider this evidence. It does not fall within (k), and the judge never corrects it. Why is there not a a reasonable likelihood of of jury mistake?\n One, Your Honor, the judge admonished the jury that the prosecutor's statements were that of an advocate, and that  \n No. Precisely, if I recall and you correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the judge said was that the prosecutor's statements were were not evidence. Of course, they're not evidence. The issue isn't whether they were evidence. They were statements of the law. The judge didn't say anything about whether they were correct or incorrect statements of the law. It seems to me that the judge's response to the objection was totally beside the point.\n The nevertheless, the judge's response relegated the prosecutor's statements as to his personal opinion as to that of a some as as of of to argument, which is a statement of an advocate. And the jury, from the time it was empanelled, guilt phase, and through the penalty phase, and at the concluding instructions was repeatedly instructed that they would be getting the instruction on the law from the court. And here  \n And the court didn't give them an instruction on this contested point.\n I respectfully disagree.\n He didn't come out and say, yes, you can consider this under (k). He never said that.\n No, but (k) says you can consider it under (k).\n (k) says you can consider evidence that that goes to the gravity of the crime. I will be candid to say I think you're stretching things about as far as you can stretch, as Boyde held, that that character evidence pre and up to the time of the crime can be considered reasonably under that factor. But certainly evidence of what an individual did after the crime is committed does not naturally follow within (k) at all, and I don't know why any juror would consider it unless a judge came out and said flatly you can.\n Your Honor, the California Supreme Court reasonably applied Boyde's holding, that factor (k) did call for consideration of character evidence, and that's precisely what Payton presented  \n Well, what if we conclude that there was an error here? Is there a harmless error argument that you fall back on?\n Yes, Your Honor, there is a harmless error, but before we even get to harmless error, the fact that you disagree with the ultimate conclusion of the California Supreme Court under AEDPA is not sufficient.\n May I ask  \n The California Supreme Court's decision  \n May I ask a question that goes sort of to the beginning? What is your position on whether or not the prosecutor correctly stated the law?\n The State concedes, and as the California Supreme Court recognized, the prosecutor misstated the law, but the jury would not  \n Do you also concede he did so deliberately? Do you concede there was prosecutorial misconduct is what I'm really asking.\n Absolutely not, Your Honor. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct. The prosecutor made a mistake, and the misconduct analysis, which is similar to what Boyde contemplated when they set forth the general standard for assessing whether a jury would misunderstood misunderstand an instruction is is almost the same when when you're analyzing whether the question is prosecutorial misconduct. Boyde sets forth the test for how to assess a misstatement by the prosecutor, and Boyde said that at the first instance, a statement of the prosecutor is not to be considered as having the same force as instructions from the court. And that principle was recognized by the California Supreme Court and reinforced  \n That that statement went to whether the jury was apt to accept it, not to the question of whether the prosecutor acted improperly.\n I'm sorry, Your Honor. The in this case, the prosecutor made a mistake. I don't think that there's any evidence to support the conclusion that the prosecutor committed misconduct in this case, particularly  \n Well, I I can see that a a prosecutor could say, you know, this isn't factor (k) evidence, as a way of saying that this evidence is of little weight. He did say at at one at one time, you have not heard any legal evidence of mitigation, and and that that's the troublesome part.\n Your Honor, the the State concedes that the the prosecutor did make misstatements, but I think that the bulk as you pointed out, the bulk of the prosecutor's argument went to the weight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence, and actually most of the argument by the prosecutor indicating that Payton's evidence didn't mitigate the seriousness of his rape and murder is there were similar arguments that were made by the prosecutor in Boyde and which Boyde found were not objectionable. But again, the important scrutiny is that the California Supreme Court evaluated the prosecutor's statements within the correct analytical framework matrix established by Boyde. They considered all the correct principles, the the effect of argument of counsel. They considered the instructions, and like Boyde, they found that factor (k) facially directed the consideration  \n Suppose suppose I were to take the view that it is a violation of clearly established law for a court to allow a prosecutor repeatedly to misstate the law, misinform the jury about what the law is on a life or death question without correcting that misstatement, without saying to the jury, jury, it's not for the prosecutor to argue what the law is. I tell you what the law. If the judge doesn't do that, then that meets any standard of violating clearly established law about which there should be no doubt that when the prosecutor makes a misstatement on a life or death question, it is the judge's obligation to say, jury, he is wrong. You take your instruction from me and here's my instruction. Suppose that's my view of this case. I don't Boyde and all these other cases it just strikes me that that's clearly wrong. What do I do with that?\n Well, you can find that the court was wrong and not like what you did what the court did, but the inquiry is whether the jury misunderstood the instructions as a result of the court's conduct. And that requires an analysis of the context of the proceedings, and that is precisely what the California Supreme Court did. They  \n Well, now you're getting to the question I think that Justice O'Connor raised a few minutes ago about are you urging, yes, this is error, but it was harmless?\n No, I am not agreeing that this was error at all. I agree that the prosecutor made a misstatement and that the California Supreme Court thoroughly and properly evaluated that statement  \n Well, but just on that point, if the prosecutor makes a misstatement, doesn't the trial judge have an obligation to correct it if it's significant?\n The in this case  \n Or am I wrong? Or am I wrong about that? The judge just kind of watches the ship sail over the waterfall?\n The I mean, the the trial court did correct it. It may not be the sufficient correction in this Court's eye, but the court did give an admonition that relegated the prosecutor's statements to that of the advocate and not to the instructions of the court.\n Well, what if the prosecutor had said several times to the jury during the course of his arguments that the burden of proof by the State is by a preponderance, not beyond a reasonable doubt? And the judge just says the prosecutor's arguments are just that, they're not the law. I'll instruct you. But he never says anything. Is that okay?\n It's not what we'd optimally want the court to do, but that's not the inquiry that's presented and answered by Boyde. The question is as a result of what happened. Trials are not error-free. We wish that they were, but they're not. The question is how do you respond to when a when a prosecutor makes a misstatement of law. And Boyde addresses that question. Boyde  \n Well, normally we would think the trial judge would correct a misstatement of the law by counsel. We would normally think that, wouldn't we?\n Yes.\n And it wasn't clearly done here. I mean, the the jury was reminded that arguments of counsel are just that. But there was no attempt to correct what appeared to be a misstatement.\n The court's admonition was sufficient. But we're we we have to respond to the case that's before you.\n What what admonition was sufficient? The court said something about evidence and everybody I mean, there's no question what the prosecutor said isn't evidence. But he didn't tell them he has misstated the law. We're not talking about evidence is not at issue at all. Neither side suggests that it is. It's a question is what is the law that governs this controversy, what is the law that the jury must apply to make a life or death decision.\n Right, and what was  \n And and you  \n Sorry.\n you said the judge corrected it, and I read this joint appendix. I could not find any correction.\n The court's admonition that the prosecutor's argument was not evidence but argument of counsel relegated the statements of the prosecutor to that of an advocate and did not take the prosecutor's arguments and elevate it in place of the instructions given  \n Then then it then it has another problem with it because then the judge is saying that's an argument. Jury, you've heard arguments on both sides. You decide. But it isn't for the jury to decide what the law is.\n But the analysis is whether there was a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood the court's instructions so as to preclude consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence, and that  \n Did the judge instruct the jury that you are to consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial?\n Yes, Your Honor, and actually that's one of the inquiries that Boyde required, is that you look at the instruction itself, the other instructions, and that's an inquiry the California Supreme Court did, in fact, conduct. And that is, the jury was presented with with a instruction that said, you shall consider all the evidence unless otherwise instructed, and nothing out of any of the factors (a) through (k) limited the jury's consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence or precluded pardon me  \n Oh, are you taking the position that as a matter of California procedure, the jury was entitled to consider matters that matter that was not within (a) through (k)?\n I think that the instructions encompass the jury considering something not specifically in (a) through (k) for purposes of mitigating evidence because the instructions say, you shall consider the evidence presented, and that was Payton's evidence  \n Have the California courts said that?\n That?\n Have the California courts said that (a) through (k) are is not intended to be exhaustive at the pre-Payton pardon me. Yes. Have they said that pre-Payton?\n I don't think that that issue has been presented and decided by the California Supreme Court specifically  \n I I thought the case was being argued to us correct me if I'm wrong on on the theory that this was factor (k) evidence.\n It is our position that it it does fall within factor (k) evidence, but in deciding whether the whether Payton's jury was unconstitutionally precluded from considering the evidence, you look to the all the instructions. And when you consider the direction to consider all that you shall consider all the evidence and then the concluding instruction  \n But Ms. Cortina, the the red brief maybe it's not accurate. They say the instruction was all the evidence received during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may hereafter be instructed, and then that followed what the factor (k) discussion came after that. So would it not have been possible that the jury would have thought except for the following things? Or is there something more that I missed?\n No. The written instruction followed the arguments of counsels. And what and so no, there was no instruction after that.\n So if they misunderstood the factor (k) instruction, they would have thought they could not consider all the evidence.\n There was no reasonable likelihood that they felt that they could not consider Payton's evidence under factor (k), and the California Supreme Court  \n Well, if they believed the prosecutor, they would have thought they couldn't.\n But there but as analyzed by the California Supreme Court, it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements. And as I was saying, to do so, the jury would have had to  \n But all all I'm directing my inquiry to is to the significance of the instruction to consider all the evidence. I think it's they could consider all the evidence, except that which may not be admissible, as I now or may not be relevant as I shall hereafter instruct you.\n However, nothing in the following instruction says you shall not consider Payton's mitigating evidence.\n No, but the prosecutor said that if you interpret the last instruction properly, you shall not do so.\n He said that it didn't fall within factor (k). However, the the jury would there is no reasonable likelihood and the California Supreme Court was not objectively unreasonable, including in concluding that the that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements and chosen to disregard Payton's mitigating evidence because the jury just sat through eight witnesses testifying to Payton's post-crime remorse and rehabilitation. They sat through that without any misstatements by the prosecutor. So they recognized that they had heard this evidence and that it was relevant and that it was subject to consideration. Then they heard the arguments of counsel concerning the weight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence. And although the prosecutor did make the misstatements, his statements were relegated to that of an advocate. And to conclude that the jury would disregard the repeated instructions to follow the to take the law from the court and their inevitable, long-held societal beliefs that remorse and rehabilitation are relevant to making an appropriate moral reasoned response in deciding the life or death sentence is not a reasonable conclusion. And we know that the fact in fact, that the jury did consider Payton's mitigating evidence by virtue of the questions that the juries the jury asked the court during deliberations. The jury asked whether Payton would be eligible for parole and whether any change in the law could retroactively make him eligible for parole. You only get to a consideration of whether what the effect is of saving Payton's life, under the California sentencing scheme that was existed at that time, if you believe that there's mitigation evidence to consider because California, at the time of Payton's sentencing, instructed the jury that if the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose death. Their  \n They they might not have thought that the aggravating circumstances were entitled to to great weight. I mean, we don't know how they evaluated the aggravating circumstances.\n That might be one reasonable conclusion, but the other reasonable conclusion  \n But I mean, that that is a possible conclusion, and therefore, it doesn't follow from the fact that they raised the question about life without parole that they necessarily had found that they were necessarily considering the mitigating evidence.\n It's a reasonable inference to be made from the questions asked, and that's what you're looking at.\n It's it's one possibility. Isn't that all?\n It's one reasonable inference, and that's what's the important inquiry, is that the trial the California Supreme Court reasonably considered the relevant, pertinent facts and all the applicable law in reaching a decision that Payton's jury was not unconstitutionally precluded from considering his mitigating character evidence. And I think that that the California Supreme Court's decision demonstrates that it applied Boyde to the letter faithfully and methodically, and that it it considered all the relevant facts and that its decision under these circumstances is manifestly not objectively unreasonable. And that is the requirement, and that is the inquiry that we're here today to resolve. The the Ninth Circuit failed to give the appropriate deference to the California Supreme Court's decision in deciding that the penalty should be Payton's penalty should be reversed. And the Ninth Circuit instead conflated objectively unreasonable with a determination that it personally felt that there was constitutional error and doesn't respect the distinction recognized in AEDPA between a incorrect decision or a correct decision, incorrect decision, unreasonable decision, and the higher threshold of objectively unreasonable. And unless this Court has any further questions, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n How long did the penalty phase take?\n The penalty phase took about a day with eight witnesses.\n Thank you. Mr. Gits.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start off, if I may, by addressing some of the points that were brought up just earlier, and I'd like to indicate to this Court that the California Supreme Court has held that factors (a) through (k) are the exclusive considerations that the jury must encompass in deciding whether or not to impose death or life.\n Has factor (k) been supplemented with a CALJIC instruction since Payton?\n It has. In 1983, 2 years after Payton's trial, it was supplemented to include all of the mitigating evidence that this Court has indicated the jury is entitled to consider. But what is important  \n Excuse me. Do they still call it factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental instruction that follows factor (k)?\n It's been a couple of years since I've done a death penalty trial, but I think it's still called factor (k). It's just supplemented and changed that way. The second thing is that this Court has indicated some concern over the jury question that was raised first in in the State's reply argument. And I need to put the Court, I think, in in proper context as to what occurred in in that jury question. The case was given to the jury at 11:55 on the date of of the determination, and the jury was told to select a foreman. 5 minutes they went into the deliberations room. 5 minutes later they came out and went to lunch. They didn't commence their deliberations thereafter until 1 o'clock. At 1:10, they came out with a the question that is now before the Court. And I want to suggest to this Court that it is not reasonable to believe that during that 10-minute span of time the jury considered the whether or not factor (k) applied.\n And what was the question?\n The question there were really two questions. One and I'm paraphrasing is there any possibility Mr. Payton could be released on parole if we give him life, and the second one is if the law is amended, could that be construed to be retroactively applicable to Mr. Payton. Those were the two questions.\n Those don't sound as if they thought his conversion to Christianity made a difference.\n I think, Your Honor, what the jury articulated is what this Court has seen on many occasions, the jury's concern about does life without possibility mean life without.\n Yes.\n They never went beyond that at this point in time. So what I'm suggesting to this Court is that the short span that they had to write that question, which I agree, given enough time, might permit an inference that they did consider factor (k), isn't applicable in this case.\n Well, an equal inference is they just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all given the horrific nature of this of this crime.\n Yes, I agree. And my position isn't that that the short span of you know, assists our position. Our position is that this won't assist this Court in arriving at a decision about whether the jury considered it.\n And you have to show there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an opposite conclusion.\n Yes. And Boyde teaches that the way to do that is to look at the context of the entire case in conjunction with the the instruction that was given in this case. And I want to start out that I I agree with the State that the first thing this Court should do is look at the instruction standing alone. And I want to indicate that without reference to the context of the case, the instruction standing alone does not support the inference that Payton's post-crime evidence could be considered. Now, I agree that in the context of the case, the context of the case could change that consideration. For instance, if the court, as this some member of this Court already indicated, told the jury that factor (k) is to encompass Payton's evidence, or even if the prosecutor may have said to the jury during his argument, ladies and gentlemen, although it might not seem like Payton's evidence could be considered by you under factor (k), in fact it can, then we would be left with a situation very similar to Boyde where there really is no argument among counsel as to whether or not the evidence could be subsumed under (k). And that, in the context of that case, would permit it.\n Well, on on that point and I I recognize it's it's not nearly as clean as the hypothetical you present he did say this is the prosecutor. The law in its simplicity is that if the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the sentence should be death, and so let's just line these up, and then he talks about the the conversion. So there were other parts of his argument that indicated by one interpretation this is not mitigating under special (k) under factor (k). But here he does say that you line that up and you weigh one against the other.\n I I would respond to that by saying two things. He does say that, but after he says, ladies and gentlemen, I want to address some of of Payton's evidence. I'm not suggesting and I'm and I don't believe that it applies under factor (k). But then he went on to discuss that evidence. And I agree he did. I certainly can't say he didn't. But but the real issue here is what effect likely did that have on the jury, and I I'm indicating that that given the preliminary his preliminary part about it still doesn't apply but I will address it, that is unlikely to give the jury any confidence that that evidence could be considered. So it's not at all a concession that occurred in this case whatsoever.\n Well, why wouldn't the jury conclude why isn't it the most logical conclusion that, gee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and listen to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it, so of course we must consider it because otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to all of it?\n That was a relevant consideration in Boyde and I think a powerful consideration in Boyde and in California v. Brown. Because of the context of this case, it's not relevant here. Once the judge permits both counsel one counsel to argue one way and the other counsel to argue the other way, the jury is now being relegated as the the finder of the law. In order to evaluate whether or not they could consider that evidence, they had to look at the evidence that was presented.\n Well, they they always have to say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or is it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying, well, this really isn't mitigating. And we know as lawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is that is relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it the weight that it chooses. But jurors say, well, you know, this this just is not important is what they're saying.\n Well, when the prosecutor says this doesn't fall under (k) and the defense attorney says it does fall under (k), all I'm indicating is that the argument that this would be viewed as a charade no longer has any effect. It is now a preliminary thing that the court that the jury must look to.\n Well, it's a shorthand for saying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so little weight. Now, that's I think how the jury might have interpreted it.\n Yes, Your Honor, they might. But the issue here is whether or not there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not consider that, and and that's  \n Actually that isn't really the issue. I think I find that easy. The harder issue is is whether the a person who thought about it differently than me, a judge, would have be objectively unreasonable. At least for me, that's the hard question. The question you're arguing is not hard.\n Yes. I don't think I understand Your Honor.\n I mean, I would perhaps have come to a different conclusion than California Supreme Court on that question, but we can overturn them only if they're objectively unreasonable. And that's that's the hard thing because for me.\n Yes. I there is very relatively little guidance that we have so far on the AEDPA. I think the the cases that do have some relevance are both Wiggins v. Smith and Taylor v. Williams. Wiggins v. Smith dealt with the failure of the State court to actually evaluate evidence that occurred in this case. The California Supreme Court opinion on the issue of whether or not the the court properly conducted itself has one sentence, and the sentence says and I'm paraphrasing something to the effect of the fact that the court refused to adorn factor (k) is not in itself a an error. Well, we all, I think, would would concur that that's true, but that doesn't address what happened here. It's a complete failure to address an all-encompassing event that happened, something close and I have to be careful here something close to structural error where the judge gives over the obligation to decide what the law is to the jury. The California Supreme Court not once ever considered that, and there is no reference to them doing anything other than making that one  \n Well, no, but I mean, that's that's really wrong what the judge did. But but the that that's tangential to the question. The question is, is it reasonably likely, if that hadn't occurred, that the jury would have considered the evidence that he was converted? But since it did occur, you know, they they didn't consider it. Is it reasonably likely they never considered it? That's that's the question. And then I can imagine, for what reason that Justice Ginsburg said, myself sitting in the California Supreme Court and saying, well, they heard the evidence for 2 days or a day, six witnesses, eight witnesses. They're not technicians, the jury. And and of course, they considered it. I can imagine that and that's why I'm having even though I don't agree with it.\n Yes. Considered I agree. They certainly considered the evidence, but they also, if they were following their obligation under the law, they considered whether or not they were entitled to give that any weight under factor (k). That was the primary function that was given to them. So certainly they discussed the evidence, but then did they arrive did they go in that room and arrive at a decision that maybe we can't by law consider this evidence? And I think that's the focal point here and that's the thing this Court doesn't know what happened in that jury room.\n Except if they heard so much of the evidence, isn't it unlikely that the jury thought they couldn't consider what they heard?\n The more evidence they hear, the more likely it is I think that human beings are going to consider the evidence. The evidence the the penalty evidence took place over a 2-day period of time, but I want to indicate that it took place over two half-day periods of time, and that if you put the time together, I think it comes to around 70 pages, which should be substantially less than a half-day altogether. Now, it encompassed eight witnesses, and there was a lot of evidence brought out about post-crime conduct. But it it wasn't a massive amount such as there was in Boyde, 400 pages and weeks of testimony. So I think that that's a a an important consideration too. The the Court's concern about whether or not the jury would likely consider that, it seems to me, starts with the an examination of of factor (k) itself. And and I want to indicate that Mr. Payton really didn't start out at the same mark as as the State did in its case. The language of factor (k) just doesn't on its face appear to permit consideration of that evidence. And and so, therefore, something had to have happened in the trial, we assert, to change that, to make the ambiguous, at least as applied to Payton, evidence of factor (k) applicable so that the jury would reasonably likely consider it. The events that could have happened during the context of that trial didn't happen. In fact, everything happened against the defendant. He starts off with an instruction that's against him that supports, under any natural reading, the prosecutor's language, and then he's buttressed with a prosecutor that given the plain and natural meaning of the language, is going to have a far more compelling position with the jury about whether or not it could be considered. And the and the defense attorney's position is really nothing more than an assertion, when he looks at the language itself an assertion that it was awkwardly worded. Now now, the defense attorney made reference to if this was the kind of evidence if I was a juror and I was considering this, I would think this would be important evidence. And the answer to that is of course, it is important evidence, but that's not the question. The question is whether or not it could be considered under (k). He gives he, the defense attorney, gives his position that that (k) was meant to be a catchall factor and it was meant to consume and take into effect Payton's evidence, but he had nothing to support that. He had no legal position to support it. He was faced with the plain language of the statute that didn't permit him to do that.\n Doesn't it? I mean, it it says that what's what's the exact language of that statute? I just had it here. It's it's gravity. It's the  \n It is any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime.\n Of the crime. You could say it. Yes, his his later conversion extenuated the gravity of the crime, not the not the when I try to think of this person, who is not me, thinking of that, I say, well, plausible. Plausible, not perhaps the best, but plausible, isn't it?\n Well, as we pointed out in our brief, this Court in in Skipper some Justices in in that decision indicated that well, in fact, the majority indicated that the post-crime evidence of rehabilitation in prison is, in fact, not anything that relates to culpability. Factor (k), however way you look at it and I agree that it's sufficiently ambiguous to where, given the right context, the right events happening at trial, a jury would reasonably likely look at it as covering that. But not under this case, though, because there wasn't anything that happened in Payton's trial which permitted a reasonable inference that in fact that evidence should be considered. And as to harmless error, I as we pointed out in our brief, it under the California statute, which in effect requires that if the aggravating evidence outweighs the mitigating evidence, the jury shall return a verdict of death, if there's no reasonable likelihood that the jury considered factor (k), then in effect Bill Payton was left without any mitigating evidence to be considered by the jury at all. And that means that the jury had to come back with a verdict of death. Now, that brings this Court, once the Court if the Court becomes satisfied as to constitutional error, that brings the Court, I think, very closely to to this case this Court's case in Penry v. Johnson because there the jury will not have had a vehicle in order to give effect to Payton's mitigating evidence. In Penry v. Johnson, in fact, in discussing at least the Eighth Amendment issue, this Court never really even discussed harmless error. It was reversed without any discussion. Now, I don't want to suggest the Court didn't engage in a harmless error  \n I I see where you're going, and I I see that there's some parallel. The problem in Penry was that the jury the jurors had to actually violate their instructions, and you have to escalate your argument a bit before you get to that point.\n Yes, I I agree. It's not exactly identical, but we're very close to to that point in Penry. Beyond that, the prosecutor did argue vociferously that the jury should in its determination, should be concerned about whether or not Bill Payton is going to stab the prison guards in the back, in effect, argued dangerousness, which was appropriate. But if the jury he also argued that the jury couldn't consider evidence which plainly pointed to his lack of dangerousness, his good adjustment in prison, his conversion to Christianity. So, in effect, the prosecutor was able to argue its side and and the jury wasn't able, when you get to the harmless error analysis, to argue its side. And that's what makes this, it seems to me, a very strong showing that that harmless error that the error in this case is not harmless. It had a clearly important effect.\n Is it relevant at all? This happened 24 years ago. We're sitting here trying to think of what a jury would have been thinking in a state of the law that's a quarter of a century old and facts I don't know what to think. I guess that's just irrelevant?\n Well, it's certainly relevant to Bill Payton, and and I don't demean the position of the Court. It's not relevant in terms of its impact as to future cases. There are some cases left that are still dealing out there, dealing with factor (k). The best our knowledge, we've we've done a search and we believe there is about 70 cases dealing with the old, unadorned factor (k), but of those 70 cases, none of them from and we haven't reviewed all of them, but of the ones we've reviewed, none of them deal both with Payton's pure post-crime evidence, coupled with the prosecutor's unrelenting position to the Government that they cannot consider that evidence.\n So all this was at a time before Penry was decided.\n It is the time before Penry v. Johnson was decided.\n Yes.\n It is not the time before Penry v. Lynaugh was decided. And when I say  \n Which is the Texas the Texas you know, the ones  \n Both are the Texas case. Both deal with Mr. Penry.\n Yes, one and two.\n Yes.\n Is that  \n Yes. And when I say it was not before that, I'm talking about on the date of the California Supreme Court's decision. At the time of the jury determination, this Court only had or that court only had Lockett to make a determination as to whether the evidence could be could be considered. And the court made the decision that he thought the it could be considered, but then refused to make any adjustments once it became clear that both counsel were going to argue their respective positions on the law. The the Court earlier talked about other instructions as impacting upon the the context of the case, and those were important considerations in Boyde, especially the observation that the jury was to consider any other evidence presented at either time in the trial. But in the context of this case, Your Honor, it means nothing. As I've indicated, the jury was required to ignore any evidence it heard at either phase of the trial unless it fit within factors (a) through (k). If it didn't fit within there, even though they heard that evidence, they were instructed to ignore it. Beyond that, they were also instructed that the that they were to consider the arguments of counsel. Now, being that there was no clear instruction to the jury that they had to consider factor (k) as being relevant evidence, the jury then likely put greater weight on counsel's argument, and that's why it becomes important. So the other instructions, when you put them all together, rather than putting in proper context what did occur in this case, in effect make it even harder for Bill Payton's position that the jury should consider factor (k) to be relevant.\n The the prosecutor, at the very end of his closing to the jury, did seem, even if grudgingly with it, to recognize that that this evidence was mitigating. I'm looking at page 76 of the joint appendix at the top of the page. He makes the statement, the law is simple. It says aggravating factors outweigh mitigating, and then how do those factors line up? Well, the facts of the case showing the violence, et cetera that's on the aggravating side. And then against that, defendant really has nothing except newborn Christianity and the fact that he's 28 years old. So that in that final word to the jury, the prosecutor seems to be saying, yes, they have mitigating factors, but they're insubstantial, 28 years old and the claim that he's a newborn Christian.\n It'll be up to this Court to make a determination as to where the prosecutor was going and whether or not this constitutes a concession that that the jury could consider the evidence. I our position is that viewed as a whole, he did not go to that. Certainly he permitted the jury, and he did address the issue of if the jury does consider that. He premised it by saying, I don't think this is relevant, but if and I'm paraphrasing here. But if you think it's relevant, it's still not entitled to weight. If the issue before this Court is whether or not there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury considered that evidence, then given the context of that statement, I don't think the jury can hardly be satisfied that the prosecutor in fact gave in and agreed that Payton's evidence  \n Do do we have a transcript of that hearing here?\n Of what hearing, Your Honor?\n Well, the penalty phase. I mean  \n Yes.\n one way if I'm having trouble, I'll just read it.\n It is in the in the joint appendix, the entire  \n The whole thing.\n Yes, the entire penalty evidence and all argument and the instructions is in there. And that's unless the Court has any additional questions, I have nothing further. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Gits. Ms. Cortina, you have a little over 5 minutes left.\n Justice Stevens, the real inquiry is whether the California Supreme Court's decision was objectively unreasonable. It is not whether there was a reasonable likelihood. And Payton, like the Ninth Circuit Payton's counsel  \n Could you help me on that? I thought it was two steps. I thought the question is whether there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled, and then you have to ask whether it was unreasonable for the State supreme court to conclude that there was that reasonable likelihood. Or correct me if I'm wrong.\n That is one way of approaching the case, but I think under AEDPA, what you'd look at, which would be the more appropriate way, is how the California Supreme Court analyzed the claim and not first conduct a de novo review about whether there was a reasonable likelihood. I don't think that in the end that there's much difference  \n But you can't overturn it on habeas unless there's a reasonable likelihood.\n Right. That would be right. You would have to find that the you would have to find an error and one that was objectively and then the California Supreme Court objectively unreasonable in not finding the error. This is true. So obviously the reasonable likelihood test is a is a relevant inquiry, but it is not the inquiry. And I think that that that's what Payton's argument demonstrates and the Ninth Circuit's analysis demonstrates, is that they are effectively equating a decision that the California Supreme Court's conclusion was incorrect with their personal in their subjective opinion with a with the standard that the decision must be objectively unreasonable. And in this case, the California Supreme Court's decision was manifesting not objectively unreasonable. We know we we know that objectively unreasonable doesn't have a clear definition. We do have an example of what is objectively unreasonable, and that was cited in Payton's brief and that is a failure to consider particular facts or relevant law. And we know that that didn't occur in this case. The very argument and facts that Payton insists were not considered by the California Supreme Court in applying Boyde if not in the majority opinion are found within Justice Kennard's dissent. So we have no question that the California Supreme Court identified the correct case and the correct principles within the case and considered all the necessary facts. And that should make this decision subject to deference under AEDPA. This Court last term provided additional guidance on how to assess the range of reasonable judgment through the lens of AEDPA in Yarborough v. Alvarado. And one of the things that the Ninth Circuit and Payton's analysis keeps overlooking is the Boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k). And when you analyze the the range of reasonable judgment of the California Supreme Court concerning factor (k), the specific rule of factor (k), the the range of reasonable judgment was less. The California Supreme Court had little to no leeway to conclude otherwise. Boyde's holding is broad. Boyde held that factor (k) was a broad, catchall mitigation instruction that allowed for any other circumstance that counseled a sentence less than death and specifically found that background and character fell within the ambit of factor (k). And no decision of this Court or the California Supreme Court in analyzing character has ever drawn a distinction between post-crime and pre-crime character evidence  \n There's a footnote in Boyde that seems to draw that distinction.\n The footnote in Boyde actually supports more California's position that factor (k) encompasses any other circumstance that would counsel a sentence less than death as opposed to the Ninth Circuit and Payton's interpretation that factor (k) is limited to the crime. In both the first part of footnote 5, the the Chief Justice Rehnquist rejects the dissent's argument that the gravity of the crime focused the consideration to the circumstances of the crime. Rather, it allowed the jury to assess the seriousness of what the defendant has done in light of what's the appropriate punishment, and that involves a consideration of the defendant's background and character. And then the last part of footnote 5 expressly recognizes that factor (k) allows for consideration of good character evidence, and good character evidence is only relevant to a decision about whether the person should live or die, not to circumstances related to the crime. And good character evidence under Payton and the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of factor (k) would not and could not, whether it existed pre or post-crime, fall under the meaning of factor (k). So the footnote 5 actually bolsters the ultimate broad interpretation that the California Supreme Court adopted when it applied Boyde Boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k) to the analysis of Payton's claim. And although they did, in footnote 5, distinguish the fact that it did not involve post-crime evidence in mitigation, it didn't decide the question. It was simply noting a fact that distinguished the case from Skipper. And and AEDPA requires that we follow the holdings of the Court and not dicta. So when we start  \n Thank you, Ms. go ahead and make one more sentence.\n The California Supreme Court's decision was a reasonable application of Boyde and the Ninth Circuit's reversal of it is and this Court should  \n I think we understand you.\n Exactly. Thank you. (Laughter.)\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: For 124 years, as state power over alcohol has ebbed and flowed, one principle has remained virtually constant, that states may regulate alcohol by one set of rules, not by two. New York and Michigan consigned out of-state wine, and only out-of-state wine, to the three tier system for closing the market to thousands of small family-run wineries and their customers for the benefit of a liquor distributor oligopoly. Discrimination is the core concern of the Commerce Clause, and it sends a powerful signal that the state is engaged, not in legitimate regulation, but in economic protectionism. The states and the liquor distributors make a sweeping argument that this Court has consistently rejected, that the Twenty-First Amendment creates plenary state authority.\n Well, under your view, could the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New Jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New York wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?\n Yes, Justice Kennedy.\n So, under your view, the whole three-tier system has to go down?\n No, Justice Kennedy. So long as the state does not discriminate against out-of-state entities, it is free to, as this Court  \n Well, under my hypothetical. I don't know exactly how the way it works, you have to be a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer. Under your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to a New York retailer.\n That is or a challenge, as you ask the question, Justice Kennedy, could be mounted to that, under the same theory that we're advocating here. The state may have a different set of defenses that it doesn't have here. But  \n But so far as the rationale is the same.\n The  \n It seems to me that, under your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.\n It has to pass constitutional muster.\n And when you say there is no precedent I mean, I think a much more modest claim than you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot discriminate against out-of-state liquor i.e., the physical liquid which is really more modest and keeps the three-tier effect now, your that claim, that they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in Young's Market. I read the briefs in that case. The briefs presented that Court you could have written those briefs. And the difficulty for you is, it articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment. And this Court squarely rejected it.\n Your Honor, Young's Market the result in Young's Market was correct  \n The result, I understand, you could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.\n Exactly.\n Reading Justice Brandeis' opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his result.\n The the cases that followed Young's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a very sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment. The Court began trenching on that very broad view immediately in 1939.\n But why wasn't that broad view appropriate, given the difference between the language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words \"to the same extent and in the same manner,\" and the Webb Kenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty First Amendment, leaves out \"to the same extent and the same manner.\" It just says that \"alcoholic beverage so that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use therein, in violation of laws thereof.\" It doesn't say \"nondiscriminatory laws.\"\n Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the there was no need for the Webb-Kenyon Act to repeat the language of the Wilson Act. The Wilson Act dealt with the question of discrimination. The Webb-Kenyon Act dealt with questions that arose subsequent to the enactment of the Wilson Act. And as this Court has held in Craig versus  \n Well, maybe that's the Act, but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they adopt the language, \"to the same extent and in the same manner\"?\n I think the reason for that is because it was so obvious that the state could not, prior to prohibition, discriminate. It was not only embodied in the Wilson Act, but it was embodied in at least three cases of this Court.\n But it was not obvious to the person who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first instance, because as I as I understand it, there was an anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped. And do we know why it was dropped?\n It was dropped essentially because it was redundant.\n Well, but is that a is that on a legislative history record somewhere? Do we know that?\n No, Justice Souter, that is not expressly on the record. What is on the record, however, is that the Court was aiming or, excuse me, the Congress was aiming at specific Supreme Court decisions. There and it and the one case that was clearest on point on discrimination was Scott versus Donald, applying both the Commerce Clause and the Wilson Act to forbid discrimination. And there was there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to overturn that decision. And as this Court has held in Craig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty First Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate both the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore to the states the police power that they had before prohibition. Emphatically, discrimination was not a part of that police power. It was a very accepted context. So, too, is it today. When the when the liquor distributors in the states asked this Court to overturn the Bacchus decision and to adopt a plenary view of the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not just asking you to overturn the Bacchus decision; it is asking you to overturn cases starting with the Midcal decision in 1980, the more recent Healy decision, and others, that have held that the core purposes of the Commerce Clause and the Twenty-First Amendment must be harmonized, that the Commerce Clause was never intended to be obliterated. And when you look at the core values of the two clauses, they do not clash. The core purpose of the Commerce Clause is nondiscrimination. The core purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment is temperance. And if you have a discriminatory statute, it sends a very strong signal that, in fact  \n Well, it's not only temperance, but it's control over revenues. Can you tell me, is the is there a New York State excise tax on alcohol?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n And is it collected by the wholesaler?\n Yes, it is.\n All right. What is it, ten dollars a gallon, or what?\n It's it turns out to  \n Is it on one  \n a few cents a bottle, yes.\n It is on one  \n It's on it's and all alcohol.\n Under our cases, can the California winery be required to remit the tax to the New York State revenue authorities?\n We believe so, Your Honor.\n Is that consistent with Quill?\n It is consistent with Quill. The way that the states there are 26 states that allow direct interstate shipment of wine, and the FTC has examined their record to see if they are doing okay. And one of the things that they do are able to do is tax collection. New Hampshire, Louisiana, and Nevada do collect taxes. The way they do it is by requiring a permit in order to ship wine into the state. That takes care of a number of problems, including all sorts of accountability concerns that the state may raise.\n What  \n Under  \n what do you make of the argument that there's no practical way, except at great expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?\n Justice Souter, this is one of the most regulated industries in America, of course, and the model legislation that has been adopted by a number of states includes record-keeping provisions, it requires that wineries  \n Well, I will grant that's required, but the argument, as I understand it, is, to find out whether they're doing what they are required to do, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit. And that's one thing in the state; it's another thing across the country.\n No, it's important to recognize, Justice Souter, that under the three-tier system, which is which is where the states of New York and Michigan are saying that the other state wineries have to go the three-tier system does not do that. The states already rely on the Federal Government and the other states to police the wineries.\n So you're  \n Should they  \n saying they are not dropping in to local wineries to do audits, in fact?\n They may, in some instances. It is primarily a federal a federal activity.\n What do we have in the record on that?\n There is not there is not a great deal on the record, either way, on that, Your Honor.\n I don't know what you mean by \"it's primarily a federal activity,\" that the Federal Government polices compliance with the state tax laws?\n That's correct, Your Honor. Under the  \n How does that occur?\n under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, any violation of a state law is a federal offense and it is a violation so basically, whether it's under-age access, whether it's taxation, whatever  \n But does the federal authority make a routine audit to see that the state tax has been paid?\n Basically, every single time that there is a transaction, it is recorded by the U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau. And if it may please the Court, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time  \n Yes.\n for rebuttal.\n I have just one further question. Justice Kennedy asked you, \"What about the wholesaler? What about the retailer?\" What about alcoholic beverages other than wine?\n Justice Ginsburg, very important question. We are here today because a majority of states have chosen to regulate wine distinctively. And a handful of them, including Michigan and New York, have chosen to do so in a discriminatory manner. So long as states do not discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard to other alcohol and they don't; there's a flat prohibition across the United States, in terms of beer and other types of spirits we will not be here, because there would be no discrimination; there would be a single rule, and that rule would be, no one gets to do it.\n Thank you.\n Ms. Sullivan?\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Nothing in today's case, Justice Kennedy, requires you to take on the three-tier system, for the issue that is presented here is a very narrow one.\n Well, it's very narrow, but the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked. I just don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical where a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the you know, the physical facilities and so forth that the New York wholesaler does.\n All that we ask in this case, Justice Kennedy, is that you strike down Michigan and New York's decision to apply the three-tier system to everyone except their own in-state  \n Well, I know, but what  \n producers of wine  \n but you're all you're asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.\n Justice Kennedy, in our case, we want to suggest that it is just as in Healy and Bacchus that a law that discriminates in favor of in-state producers and against out-of-state producers loses its immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment. As Justice Scalia said in concurrence in Healy, a liquor law's discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment. It's really the state's position, aided by their wholesaler allies, that it is the sweeping one. Their position is that every state law that regulates the importation of liquor is, per se, valid if it has any conceivable rational connection to a state purpose. So, for example, if Michigan wanted to simply bar all California wines, facially exclude California wines, saying, \"There are too many of them, it interferes with\"\n Your answer to Justice Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about.\n That's exactly correct, Justice Ginsburg. As you've said in the context of gender discrimination, you can cure an equal-protection problem by leveling up or leveling down. In this case, we would suggest that the principle of free trade that was the reason, the principal reason, for the framing of the Constitution and has been reflected in over a century of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, suggests that you should the remedy should be to open the markets to out of-state producers  \n But that's a decision for the state to make. I mean, the what  \n Correct, Your Honor.\n Not for this Court.\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n You don't deny that a state that Michigan could bar all out-of-state wine not just not just California, but they could bar all out-of-state wines?\n That's correct, Justice Stevens, if it were in aid, and only if it were in aid, of the states and necessary to serve the state's internal purposes.\n The only reason being given to give a monopoly to local producers, that's their  \n That's  \n whole purpose. But could they do that?\n The state can have a monopoly if it's, itself, a market participant. What the state may  \n No, I'm saying just to look at the just limit to the market to the only market participants would be Michigan wine  \n Private  \n wineries.\n Justice Stevens, a state may not discriminate against out-of-staters for the sole purpose of economic protectionism.\n Well, I'm trying to think of what Brandeis could have been thinking.\n In Young's Market.\n Yes, that's right. And this is a reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have no doubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of the dormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name of original package doctrine  \n Correct.\n which meant that the foreign liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor. Now, he's thinking, \"Why is that? What is that package doctrine?\" And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause the dormant Commerce Clause is the implication from the existence of the commerce power in the Constitution. So if we have an amendment that says \"that aspect of the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply,\" that means the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant Commerce Clause into six different parts, or even two.\n But Justice  \n Now, maybe I think that's how he's reasoning.\n But  \n And if he is, and even if he isn't, why isn't that right?\n Justice Breyer, the Young's Market language permitting state discrimination is, indeed, broad, but it's been superceded by 40 years of this Court's jurisprudence harmonizing the Twenty-First Amendment with the rest of the Constitution. Remember, Justice Brandeis, in Young's Market, didn't even think the Equal Protection Clause applied to liquor imports, a position that's inconsistent with Craig against Boren. And nobody would suggest today that equal protection permits a state to import only from male-owned wineries or only import wine from white-owned wineries. So there the 40 years of jurisprudence  \n But Craig against Boren was  \n has been  \n had nothing to do with the Commerce Clause.\n Correct, Your Honor, but if if there were a law the states are claiming that any law governing  \n Nothing to do with importation, either.\n But the dormant Commerce Clause reflects a fundamental structural principle that is every bit as much a part of the Constitution as the Equal Protection Clause upheld in Craig v. Boren. Indeed this Court, in cases from McCulloch to the Eleventh Amendment cases and state sovereignty cases, has recognized that a principle of the Constitution is no less fundamental because it is a structural implication of the text. So the dormant Commerce Clause stands on the same footing as the affirmative power of Congress and on it's the same footing as the Equal Protection Clause at issue  \n Do you think Congress  \n in Craig v. Boren  \n could enact a statute authorizing the states to do just what they've done here?\n Absolutely, but it has not. And the Wilson Act to go back to Justice Souter's question and Justice Ginsburg's question Congress could authorize it as it has done, for example, in the McCarran Ferguson Act, allowing the states to discriminate against out-of-state industry with respect to the industry of insurance. It has not done so here. Webb-Kenyon did not authorize discrimination, and the Wilson Act forbade discrimination for just reasons Justice Ginsburg described. It said you may regulate imports of liquor in the same manner as local liquor laws. And, of course, the purpose of Section 2 was to allow to the dry states to keep dry by preventing all those original packages from piling up in the railway stations and being open to bootleggers throughout the state, undermining the dry policies of the state. Wilson forbade discrimination. Web Kenyan didn't authorize it. And in Congress' most recent articulation of its view of the harmony between the Twenty-First Amendment and the rest of the Constitution, the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, passed in 2000, enacted in 2000, Congress has a rules-of-construction section that says, \"We view any state plea to the federal courts to enforce their laws as reflecting the jurisprudence of this court.\" And, in fact, floor debate on that rules-of-construction section reflected allusions to Bacchus, Healy, and the other cases that said dormant commerce the negative implications of the Commerce Clause, no less than the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Establishment Clause, constrain the states in their regulation of importation of liquor. So with all respect to Justice Brandeis, Justice Breyer, the Young's Market statements about discrimination have been superceded. What New York and Michigan have done here is say that one set of exceptions apply only to in-state producers, just as Connecticut, in Healy, said, \"If you just sell beer within our state, you don't have to face price ceilings that you have to face if you do business over in Massachusetts or Rhode Island.\" Just as in Bacchus, the you struck down a decision an excise tax exemption that said, \"If you're an importer of liquor, you have to pay an excise tax, but if you're a local producer of locally produced wine and spirits, you get out of that restriction.\"\n Okay, we've got one difference from Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here, which I gather was not made, or made seriously, in Bacchus, is there really is a need for differential treatment for purposes of enforcement. Go back to the enforcement of the tax law.\n Justice  \n How are we supposed what standard are we supposed to use to judge that argument? And, by that standard, how good is the argument?\n Justice Souter, we believe the standard should be strict scrutiny, though there must be a necessity to serve  \n Because  \n a legitimate  \n it's facial discrimination.\n Because it's facial discrimination. It's absolutely undisputed. Michigan in fact, Michigan state concedes that they have flatly banned out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers. There's no question that this is facially discriminatory. But even if the standard were a more deferential one in which all the state needed to show was a reasonable need for discrimination, it can't come close to doing that here. Neither Michigan nor New York has shown that the facial discrimination here is necessary to protect minors or to protect the collection of taxes. Let's start with minors. The Michigan claim that it's protecting against under-18 sales is belied by the fact that Michigan is allowing 40 Michigan wineries and, at last count, 7500 Michigan retailers to deliver directly to consumers. The way to protect my so just as in Craig v. Boren, the exception for young women to drink 3.2 beer, as opposed to young men, belied the state's interest in temperance. So the pattern of exceptions here that Michigan has created belies any notion that it's protecting under-18-year-olds from drinking. And, of course  \n But what about audits for revenue  \n On revenue, the nondiscriminatory means that's available to the state that Michigan and New York have not shown any reason to reject 26 states have adopted some version of this is to require an out-of-state winery to get a permit. And that's a Justice Breyer, one thing that's still left of Brandeis. You can require a permit from an out-of-state winery, which would be unusual to acquire from widgets or milk. But you can require a permit, and, as a condition of the permit, Justice Souter. The out-of-state winery has to agree to submit to the state's jurisdiction, to submit to the state's tax jurisdiction. And, Justice Kennedy, whether or not Quill would permit taxation if you were simply sending by common carrier, our clients want to want to pay taxes, want to sign up for permits, want to play on a  \n Well  \n level playing field  \n well, they do today, I'm sure, but [Laughter.]\n But, Justice Souter, to look at the experience  \n They you say they don't want to go to California to do an audit.\n They certainly don't, Justice Souter, but New Hampshire is a state that has actually your own state is a state that has on its Web site a set of out-of-state wineries. It requires that they keep and supply sales records on a monthly basis, that they keep those records for three years  \n Maybe we're getting ripped off.\n I [Laughter.]\n think New Hampshire's done very well collecting taxes from out-of-state producers, Justice Souter. It's a leader  \n Ms. Sullivan  \n in the field.\n may I may I I just want to clarify one point. It was just the question Justice Stevens asked. It's your position that if Michigan allows Michigan wines to be sold and possessed and consumed, that it must also allow out-of-state wine to be sold, possessed, and consumed. Would  \n That's correct.\n That is your  \n That's correct, Justice Kennedy. But to go back to the physical-presence question, Justice Souter, Michigan is not now Michigan officials are not now traipsing up to the upper peninsula and all around the state to inspect wineries. The record is clear on that. What Michigan does is require that wineries in Michigan send samples and records to their offices. And the Internet actually, if anything the states say that the Internet increases the danger, but the Internet also increases, in parallel, the power of the states to police out-of-state wineries without an in-state presence. Just as, Justice Stevens, the Internet may make every speaker with a PC a town crier, as you said  \n Could  \n in Reno versus ACLU  \n could a state  \n so it makes every interstate  \n could a state require an out-of-state winery to keep its books online, subject to a password, so that, with a password, they could go in and audit the books across the country, by wire?\n Yes, Justice Souter, if it were part of a an agreement to a permit that the that the out-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no extraterritorial regulation there, that would be just fine. So, yes, the state can, through Internet, so to speak, Internet monitoring, through virtual monitoring do all the work it needs to do to make sure that the out-of-state winery is paying taxes. And, by the way, Michigan does not collect taxes, Justice Kennedy, through the distributors. Michigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're in-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers. So Michigan can give no justification for why out-of-state wineries have to go through the distributors for tax purposes. They're not using the distributors as their tax-collection agents now.\n Commerce Clause, in effect, protects consumers in states from entrenched business interests that want to have protectionism, and you're you object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do it. Under that rationale, aren't all the California reciprocity laws invalid, as well?\n Justice Kennedy, reciprocity laws yet possibly. They may be a necessary requirement now that so many states are closed to states. They may be a necessary mechanism for some states trying to get wines to market in the way that the framers envisaged. It may be a necessary, for now, to get into closed states. In a world that we hope that you create, in which discrimination is not allowed, they would be completely unnecessary and possibly unconstitutional. But to return to the key point here, Michigan and New York may not facially discriminate in favor of their own producers unless they can show that reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives are unavailable. And here, Justice Souter, on any standard of heightened scrutiny, they have not come close to making that kind of showing, because there are all these other means means that have been recognized by the 26 states that don't discriminate, means that have been proven in states from New Hampshire to Virginia, means that are not based on facial discrimination. It's the discrimination that has to be shown to  \n Let me just  \n be necessary here.\n be sure I heard your answer to Justice Kennedy correctly. You'd concede that the reciprocity laws are all unconstitutional?\n Not they are subject to heightened scrutiny because they discriminate against out of-staters in a way that you could not for example, in New Energy, you said that you can't have a preference for you can't have a discrimination in Ohio in reciprocity for Indiana. Reciprocity laws normally do violate the principle of dormant Commerce Clause invalidation.\n And you contend that they do the liquor reciprocity laws, all of them are unconstitutional.\n Not we contend that they would be subject to strict scrutiny, and they could be upheld if the state could show that they are closely tailored in a  \n They can that they can be  \n way that these laws are not.\n upheld by making a showing that you say is virtually impossible to make.\n Your Honor, that's not before, and if there were other reasons  \n No, but I think it is  \n the state could [Laughter.]\n it is an interesting question as to whether that's a that's a you know, that's a necessary consequence of this decision, in your view. you to reach the question of whether there are other state defenses in other cases. The justifications the states have given here are so terribly weak in relation to their discriminatory laws that you should strike down these laws, you should invalidate them, you should affirm the judgement of the Sixth Circuit and reverse the judgements of the Second Circuit. Thank you very much.\n Thank you, Ms. Sullivan. Mr. Casey.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: For more than 70 years, the Twenty-First Amendment has permitted states to restrict the importation and delivery of alcohol by out-of-state vendors. There are substantial differences between licensed in-state vendors of alcohol and out-of-state vendors that are not subject to the full extent of state regulatory and taxing powers. Because of those differences, Michigan requires that sales, including direct shipment of alcohol, be performed only by licensed, strictly regulated, in-state vendors. This importation regulation is a power expressly conferred by the text of the Twenty-First Amendment. It's consistent with the entire history of alcohol regulation in this country, and it's consistent with this Court's jurisprudence interpreting the Twenty-First Amendment  \n Now the Bacchus case cuts against you, to some extent.\n The Bacchus case was a very unique situation that we believe is not in any way controlling in the present case. It was not an importation case; it was an exemption from a state excise tax on wholesalers for alcohol that was already within the state's stream of commerce.\n Well, but I think what's fairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to look at the language of Bacchus, and the language of Bacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination component of the Commerce Clause to liquor control. I think that's a fair and necessary reading of the case. Now  \n I disagree that that is a necessary reading  \n And I know it  \n of the case.\n involved pineapple wine and all that. I know that, but [Laughter.]\n what we're talking about is the language of the Court in that case.\n Correct, but you're you have to understand that language in light of the actual context. There, the state did not even assert a Twenty-First Amendment defense.\n Well, then you have to understand Young in the light of its context, where there was no discrimination  \n There was discrimination in Young, Your Honor, and I'd like to get to that. But to focus on Bacchus for a moment, the state never asserted the Twenty First amendment, and it was undisputed  \n No, but the question was before the Court, because the dissent certainly raised the question.\n Correct. And we have suggested, in our brief, that the Bacchus case is distinguishable and not controlling here. We have also suggested that Bacchus was incorrectly decided. We can prevail in this case without overruling Bacchus, but we have suggested that  \n Well, why don't you focus on that? Because it's a little hard to plan on overruling that case. [Laughter.]\n Well  \n So why don't you at least address how you would distinguish Bacchus? Because there is a lot of language in there that cuts against your position.\n The only justification for the statute in Bacchus was what the Court characterized as \"mere protectionism.\" That's not the situation with the Michigan statute. Again, the Michigan statute involves the paradigm or the quintessential Twenty-First Amendment power of regulating importation; it's not an attacks on alcohol that's already an exemption from a tax for two particular products.\n Well, no I mean, that  \n Do you  \n that rather lengthy statement you made earlier, that the Bacchus case didn't involve the importation of alcohol. But it did. I mean, the only reason that the in-state exemption was held to be unconstitutional was because you were treating out-of-state sellers differently. How can you possibly say that  \n It was treating  \n the case didn't involve it?\n it was treating two particular items of in-state production differently than all other in-state items and out-of-state items; but it was a taxation issue, not an importation issue. And as the Court said in Bacchus and in Capital Cities, the correct analysis in the in evaluating this kind of case is to determine, first, whether the activity of the regulation at issue is an exercise of a power conferred by the Twenty-First Amendment  \n Well, why don't we focus on the Court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by Justice White. He said, \"Hawaii's discriminatory tax cannot stand.\" And then he said, \"Whatever you can say about the Twenty-First Amendment, one thing is certain, the central purpose was not to empower the states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.\" That was this Court's explanation for ruling the way it did, even though there was this infant industry of pineapple whatever.\n That was the first stage of the Court's analysis. The Court went on to say it was not supported by any clear concern of the Twenty-First Amendment in combating the evils of an unrestricted traffic in liquor  \n Well, your opponents have said that there isn't any clear countervailing interest here. They're saying you can't claim you're protecting kids, because you're selling to the kids at home; there's no serious audit-collection problem; and the other regulatory interests they didn't say this, but are, sort of, gauzy the way they're stated. I mean, they're saying that, by a process of elimination, what you get down to is nothing but discrimination and protectionism. What is what is your answer to that? Where is  \n We  \n the substantial interest?\n we disagree wholeheartedly with that. The Michigan  \n I know, but  \n the Michigan regulations do promote the state's interest in temperance. They do give the state a better  \n Well, you I mean, you say that, but how? The very activity that you don't want them to engage in, you're engaging in, or your local wineries are engaging in, for example.\n But the key is, with an in-state licensee, the state has the ability to enforce against that licensee, to inspect, to punish the licensee  \n Do we  \n to hold them accountable.\n do we have a record of what the state is doing with respect to its in-state licensees, indicating what it could not do effectively to out-of- staters? What do we have in the record?\n The record in this case consisted of a small number of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, some surveys that were submitted as exhibits to motions for summary judgement. Both sides submitted that type of evidence. The District Court decided this was a question of law, and specifically said that he did not consider any of the factual evidence. So the record  \n Well, should  \n was not fully developed.\n should we send it back for if we disagree with the rationale, should one or the other of these cases go back for evidence on what, in fact, the state is doing in relation to its in-state licensees and evidence that it could not effectively do the same with respect to out-of-staters?\n Yes, if  \n And what would you show? What do you, in effect make an offer of proof.\n We would show that the Michigan requirement limiting sales and direct shipping to in-state licensees is required because the state only has effective enforcement authority over in-state licensees. But  \n Well, but wait a minute. You it was suggested that the state could require a license of an out-of-state supplier, and that that license could be conditioned upon submission to Michigan's jurisdiction in all respects. Is that not feasible?\n Michigan does have a current license for out-state seller of wine. You know, these players  \n But could you not require submission to  \n We  \n Michigan's jurisdiction for all purposes of enforcement?\n Certainly, we could pass a law to that effect. The problem is  \n And if you if you did that, could you require, as I suggested of Counsel on the other side, that you that, as a condition of the licensing, that the business records of these companies be placed in some secure online fashion, that, with a password, you could get into and do an audit across the continent just as readily as you could do an audit next door? Could Michigan not do that?\n But there is no guarantee that such an audit would be just the same as an audit of an in-state  \n Well, let me ask, once we accept the proposition I think this is the necessary reading of Bacchus that the Commerce Clause applies to liquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's just like any other commodity food, milk, et cetera and, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to show that this discriminatory treatment is justified maybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny. And this trial has occurred. You have had that opportunity. I don't see why you have a right to go back.\n Despite the lack of evidence in the record and the fact that District Court did not consider that evidence, the Sixth Circuit dismissed all of those claims of the state and remanded for entry of judgement on the Plaintiffs without giving us an opportunity to develop that record. I also want to say  \n See, I don't I don't understand. Didn't you have an opportunity to develop the record? I mean, this was  \n There was  \n a discriminatory matter. It was your burden to show that whatever discrimination existed assuming that we find the law the way Bacchus seemed to say it is it was your burden to show that there was some justification for that discrimination.\n There  \n You had your chance to show it.\n there was evidence in the record. There were affidavits from Michigan enforcement officials about stings, about problem with enforcing  \n All right, well  \n against Internet  \n tell us what those what that material is, and if we find that material sustains your burden, that's fine, you win; and if it doesn't, you lose. I don't know why we have to let you go back and [Laughter.]\n and retry the case.\n Our key position is that before you get to that kind of evidentiary burden, the legal question  \n That's what I'm interested in. You win, either way. If it maybe if the Commerce Clause dormant Commerce Clause discrimination principle applies, you win, if we scrutinize strictly and say you have a good justification. Whether you do or not, I guess I'll find out from reading the record, but I'm more interested in the first half, which is doesn't apply at all. Now, your opponent said, in response to my pointing to Brandeis on this, that to support you, as to precedent, Bacchus. Young's Market isn't any good anymore. As to concept, you can divide the dormant Commerce Clause into a you have to favor out-of-state principle, which was the original package doctrine, which has long since disappeared, and the anti-discrimination principle, which hasn't disappeared. And her third part, implicit, is, historically, this whole Section 2 was aimed at the original package part; there is not a word in any brief I saw that suggests any motive in Section 2 to get rid of the anti-discrimination principle. I haven't found a word in support on your side on that. So she says, \"Put those three things together, and we win.\" That's her point. Now, what's your response?\n We disagree with that entire position. The text  \n I know you do. [Laughter.]\n the text of the Twenty-First Amendment the text of the Twenty-First Amendment gives states the right to control imports. The history of the Twenty-First Amendment in the Webb-Kenyon Act clearly demonstrate the purpose of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to eliminate alcohol shipments from  \n Do you think  \n the Commerce Clause.\n that Michigan can prohibit the importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine to be produced, sold, and consumed?\n Yes. That's precisely what situation was with  \n I know you do, but the principle of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the Wilson Act was already there very clear is to stop the original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out of-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you had to sell less. I mean, that's what it's there for. I didn't find a word, in other words, contrary to what I've just said; and if there are such words, now is the time to point them to me to point them out.\n The title of the Webb-Kenyon Act is, \"It is in an act divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases. The clear intent of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to remove alcohol from the Commerce Clause. The Constitution the Twenty-First Amendment constitutionalized that Commerce Clause framework.\" That's what this Court said in Craig v. Boren. Craig v. Boren also said, \"The Twenty-First Amendment creates an exception to the operation of the normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause.\"\n Well, then you are asking us, I guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first one that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive and well? Was it Justice Stewart? And I forgot which case it was. It was  \n That may be. The Commerce Clause remains alive and well, but the Commerce Clause  \n In the context of alcoholic beverages.\n In the context of powers expressly conferred upon the states by the Twenty-First Amendment, that's an exception to the operation the normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause. Commerce Clause has to be read in light of the Twenty-First Amendment, just as the Twenty-First Amendment has to be read in light of the Commerce Clause and other provisions of the Constitution.\n But that's a different argument than the one you made before, which seems to be saying the Twenty-First Amendment trumps, not that the two have to be harmonized.\n When you read the two in light of each other, the purposes of each, it is clear that the purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment was to remove alcohol from interstate commerce as a constitutional matter, to prevent Congress from tampering with it in the future, to give the judgement to the states as to  \n Well, you  \n the necessity for  \n you say further than that; you say the purpose was to allow that the states discriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses.\n That is one of the purposes, yes. In that in the case that was decided immediately after the Young's Market, Mahoney, and Indianapolis Brewing, the Court said, \"Discrimination is permissible in this narrow context, where the state is acting pursuant to its Twenty First Amendment powers and regulating importation of alcohol.\"\n But that gets us back to Bacchus and what to make of that.\n I as I indicated, I don't believe Bacchus overrules those cases; it didn't even cite most of those cases. But  \n Well, the dissent seemed to think so [Laughter.]\n didn't it?\n That's correct. But, as I said, we believe Bacchus is distinguishable, because that was mere protectionism, the state does have other justifications here  \n Well, we've also said that mere protectionism is permitted.\n Mere protectionism is permitted. In this case, if we have to present other justifications, we have, and there are other justifications, unlike the situation in Bacchus. So even if the Bacchus rationale is good law, we still prevail on that. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Ms. Halligan?\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In answer to your question first, Justice Breyer, the Twenty-First Amendment does not propose a nondiscriminatory ban. The Court rejected that position, not just in Young's Market and Mahoney in Indianapolis, but also in Clark Distilling, the case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act, itself. It held that the Webb-Kenyon Act operated to remove any immunity that had been conferred by the dormant Commerce Clause. Bacchus is not to the contrary. In North Dakota, which follows Bacchus, the Court relied again on Young's Market to say that the states could impose different rules on out-of-state vendors where they were necessary to protect the integrity  \n Do you do you take the position that your colleague on your same side takes, that a state can permit only the sale, consumption, and of its own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?\n The express terms of the Twenty First Amendment would allow that if particularly if it were necessary to advance the concerns of the Twenty-First Amendment. For example  \n No, no, don't  \n No  \n don't put in the qualifications.\n just for local protectionism.\n Simply for mere protectionism?\n It's just for local protectionism. We want to promote our wines, and not anybody else's.\n The terms of the amendment would allow that, but I don't think the Court needs to explore the outer parameters of the Twenty-First  \n Well, I'm trying to understand what your  \n the Twenty-First  \n what your theory is. And so you are in agreement with your colleague that this could be done, if New York chose. You can only drink New York-grown wines in sell and consume in the state of New York.\n It could be done, but that question really isn't presented here, because  \n But could Congress pass a law forbidding it?\n That's a difficult question, because  \n Yeah. All right. But I need an answer to it. [Laughter.]\n Because, you see, what's going to come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say, \"Well, didn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act?\"\n Let me answer both of those questions, if I can, Your Honor. Certainly, this Court has held, repeatedly, that the Twenty-First Amendment did not, in any substantial way, completely repeal Congress' affirmative power under the Commerce Clause. It said that in Midcal and Capital Cities. But we would argue that if Congress acted in a way which completely removed state authority to determine whether or not alcohol could be sold and the terms under which it could be sold for example, if Congress said all states must be dry then we would argue that the Twenty-First Amendment wouldn't allow that, because that would completely eviscerate any state authority.\n How can that be? I mean, if this is a constitutional elimination of the Commerce Clause, how can Congress bring it back in simply by enacting a statute?\n The legislative history makes clear that the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to eliminate the impediments posed by the dormant Commerce Clause and authorize states to regulate it.\n But you you want us to read it by its terms. It doesn't say anything about the dormant Commerce Clause. If we read it absolutely the way one of your arguments wants us to do, surely it excludes Congress.\n By terms of our  \n So you don't want us to read it absolutely.\n Your Honor, I don't think that again, I don't think that you need to decide those questions in this case. This case goes to what's at the very core of the Twenty-First Amendment, whether states can decide who can sell liquor to their citizens and whether or not states  \n But it also goes to the very core of the Commerce Clause. And there are really two classifications of dormant Commerce Clause cases. One is and I think it's an improper use of the term \"dormant clause\" is where there's discrimination. Only the Congress can allow discrimination against out-of-state products. That's one whole classification. And that's what's and that's what's involved here.\n North Dakota indicates otherwise, I believe, Your Honor. In North Dakota, this Court said that, because, when alcohol flows across the border, it poses unique risks to the regulatory regime, because the state can't bring the alcohol within the full extent of its regulatory and supervisory powers, that it may be appropriate and necessary for states to impose unique rules on out-of-state vendors. In North Dakota, the Court did not say  \n Well, but that's fine. And the other side isn't denying that here, that if, you know, they're discrimination means treating out-of-state people differently without good reason.\n But there is good reason  \n Now, if you're willing to okay, if you're willing to acknowledge that, then we're halfway there and we're just arguing about whether there is good reason here or not.\n There is good reason here, Your Honor. What's critical about New York's law, as well as Michigan's law, is that it requires that any alcohol vendor have a physical presence in the state. And that's important for a couple of reasons. The state can't meaningfully oversee traffic in alcohol with an out-of-state entity. Petitioner suggested  \n What is it doing with the in state entities? I mean, one of the claims is that nobody is posting officers outside the in-state wineries, no one's making substantial physical audits of in-state wineries. Is that wrong?\n It is wrong, Your Honor. It's certainly not the case that we have an SLA inspector outside every entity that sells liquor. That would not be possible. But it is true that the state liquor authority can, and does, physically inspect the premises. They do so to determine whether  \n What do they inspect them for? Their books, I suppose.\n Well, more than that, and this is why the physical presence is important and why the Internet hypothetical that Your Honor raised would not would not satisfy the state's concerns. What the state can do is, it can go onto a premises, and it can count whether the bottles on the shelves of that premises match the records. That's the best way to detect whether or not there is evasion. Because if you have  \n And is there a record that the state is doing that?\n There is not clear evidence in the record with respect to that to that level of detail, but that  \n Well, isn't that the end of that issue, then? I mean, it is your burden, isn't it?\n Your Honor, there is material in the McKeon affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix Mr. McKeon is the Chair of the state liquor authority but it's also the case that to suggest that because there is some option out there and there's no firm evidence that a less prescriptive rule would, in fact, satisfy the state's concerns in preventing diversion and tax evasion but the possibility that's there's some rule out there, because other states have adopted more lax rules, is to treat alcohol like any other product. And the Twenty First Amendment reflects a consensus by this nation that alcohol is unique, that it should not be open to  \n Well, the Twenty-First Amendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated as unique, and the issue here is whether you're really doing that in a way that supports your claim of interest.\n Yes  \n And, so far, the one specific thing I've heard from you is that state inspectors do go on winery premises, and they count bottles, and they see if they match what's on the written record.\n They also draw on the assistance of local law enforcement. And this is also  \n But if that's  \n set forth  \n if that's really what New York's concern is, then why does New York say, \"Ah, but out-of-staters, if only you establish an office here not a winery; an office you can operate, and you can make the direct sales from that office, and even in\" I think your brief told us that, well, these small wineries, out-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry about, because, after all, they could join together a group of them could open an office. Now, that office, owned by a group of out-of-state vintners is not going to have bottles on the shelf, is it?\n Yes, Your Honor, it would. That's the state laws requires that any licensed winery have a government-bonded storehouse or ware-room storehouse storeroom or warehouse, pardon me  \n Well, isn't the  \n The reason for that is because physical products  \n How do you envision this combination of small wineries? You said that in-state establishments might be jointly maintained by out-of-state wineries.\n Yes, Your Honor. The state liquor authority has not issued any regulations on this, but presumably what they would say is, you could share a space, provided that the physical property of each winery, the bottles, is segregated so that the states can come in and check whether or not each winery's products conform with their records. There are other reasons why a physical presence is important, as well. First of all, the state draws on local law enforcement extensively to identify illegal activities, and that would not be possible with any entity located out-of-state. Additionally  \n What illegal I'm sorry you've got to be specific. What illegal activities? Selling to minors?\n It could be selling to minors, but it could also simply be sale out of an unlicensed premises, where you are selling outside the proper hours of sale, or sale outside of the three-tier system  \n Yeah, but if licensed premises don't serve a state interest, then you can't require a licensed premises, so that argument doesn't get too far.\n But, Your Honor, the principle that having entities that sell liquor be licensed, is one that is at the heart, not just at the  \n How does how does requiring them to have an in-state office somehow prevent them from shipping to minors from out of state  \n It  \n or from shipping to consumers from out of state without paying you their tax?\n It  \n How does the opening of an  \n Right.\n an office in New York State at all prevent that?\n It can't prevent it a hundred percent, but no  \n It can't prevent it at all.\n Your Honor, it can deter it, and it can deter it significantly, because, first of all, there is a much more significant opportunity to identify the illegal activities; and, secondly, if a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer knows that, that operates as a powerful deterrent  \n What did  \n We seem to be talking may I just ask one we seem to be talking about two different things. Justice Scalia was assuming that, if you have the license and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from outside. And I is that the assumption? Or is your argument that New York can require does require the in state warehouse, and you can ship into in New York, you can ship only from that warehouse?\n To be clear, the state has not issued regulations that specifically address that point, because  \n So the we don't know yet.\n We don't know. But in talking with the state liquor authority, they have made it clear that their intent would be to require that the liquor come first to the in-state premises  \n Well, even if I'm willing to assume that. How does that guarantee that the out-of-state winery will not, in violation of New York State law, ship directly to minors or ship directly to consumers, just simply bypassing its cache of wine in New York?\n There is no guarantee, Your Honor, but there is never any guarantee  \n There's no guarantee.\n that people won't  \n It doesn't it doesn't enable you to enforce your law any more rigorously than without having a requirement for a local office.\n That, I would respectfully disagree with. It does operate as a powerful deterrent and  \n Well, your argument there is that  \n as an investigative aid.\n if they break the law, you can shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can't effectively do that if the warehouse is in California. Isn't that your point?\n That's one of the points, but also that we're much more likely to be able to identify the illegal activities in the first place. The suggestion that we would send inspectors to California or any other place to look at books and count bottles is completely infeasible. And the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to allow states to deal with the regulatory challenges that are posed when liquor comes across the border. If we had to demonstrate that there was a hundred-percent compliance, then we couldn't have any regulation at all. That's not, I would submit, a  \n Well, to what  \n reasonable measure.\n to what extent does New York take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the states from which this wine is coming? You say we must do this to police for all kinds of things. But don't other states California, Virginia don't they have laws that their local wineries must meet?\n They  \n And is New York just saying, \"We're going to treat this thing as though it's totally unregulated, anyway\"?\n We're not suggesting that, Your Honor. What we are suggesting is that relying on other states to enforce law violations in New York State is not a very feasible alternative. Additionally, there are 33 states that have agreed with New York, a number of whom are states that have either reciprocal or unrestricted shipping statutes, and said to this Court, \"Please do not prohibit the kinds of laws that are at issue in New York and Michigan.\" So it's obviously important to the regulators in those states, as well.\n What about the states that do a allow shipment from out of state? They don't care about their  \n I can't  \n How many are there that allow shipment from out-of-state wineries?\n I believe that the current number is 26 states. I certainly can't speak to the regulatory motivations of each of those states, or the reasons why those laws might have been passed.\n It certainly suggests that what that what you're arguing is not essential to the state's enforcement of its alcohol laws.\n Well, a number of those states have, in fact, joined New York and Michigan in asking the Court not to  \n States don't like federal regulation  \n restrict that.\n of any sort, of course. I know that. [Laughter.]\n Your Honor, I think that all the Twenty-First Amendment requires the states to demonstrate is that the regulatory regime that they have chosen has some relationship to their goals of protecting the integrity of the state's system. And that's certainly what the Court suggested in North Dakota.\n Well, I'm not sure. When you have facial discrimination against out-of-state products, I think you're the bar is a little higher than that.\n Well, that was the case in North Dakota, as well. In North Dakota, the state imposed regulations on out-of-state vendors that were extremely onerous, so onerous that some vendors said they wouldn't ship products at all. That was alcohol that was not even destined for consumption within the state; but on a federal enclave. And the mere risk of diversion into unregulated and unlawful channels was enough to allow the state to impose those discriminatory rules. The same is true here. Justice O'Connor, you also asked about Bacchus, as well, and I would like to take a moment to address that. Bacchus is distinguishable in several ways. First of all, Bacchus was a tax. And while we would argue that taxes could be used to further states' interest in suppressing consumption, for example, it is certainly not at the heart of the of the Twenty-First Amendment in the way that the direct regulation of alcohol across the border is.\n No, but if you can't grant a tax exemption and it seems to me, a fortiori you can't grant a prohibition about importing at all.\n I, respectfully, would disagree with that, Your Honor. If you can't address the alcohol that flows across the border, which was precisely why the Twenty-First Amendment was enacted, as well as Webb Kenyon, because the  \n No, I'm suggesting a tax on imports is less restrictive than a prohibition on imports.\n Well, we would certainly, you know, welcome the authority to do both, but importation is what is at the heart of the Twenty-First Amendment. Bacchus is also different, because, there, the state made no effort whatsoever to defend the statute with reference to any concerns related to the Twenty-First Amendment. And Bacchus  \n And according to the District Court, in this very case, the State Attorney General conceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.\n That was an off-the-cuff remark by a single attorney, Your Honor, and that can't be taken as dispositive, given the state's vigorous defense of this statute. It also was regarding a provision that is not even directly before the Court right now which confers no different shipment privileges than are conferred on any winery, whether in-state or out-of-state, that would obtain a license to sell in New York.\n Thank you, Ms. Halligan.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n Mr. Bolick, you have, let's see, about four minutes left.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. Three very brief points. There his a panoply of tools available to states to police out-of-state wineries in direct shipping, as the Federal Trade Commission has recognized. They can, if they issue a permit, revoke that permit. And New York has authority to issue such permits under Section 105-9. The Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, for which the liquor distributors and states lobbied very hard, gives injunction authority in the home federal courts. And, of course, the federal agency, the Tax and Trade Bureau, can revoke a permit if state law is violated. In the  \n Who's going to count the bottles? [Laughter.]\n Your Honor, the state the Federal Government is able to count those, but the evidence is that they don't. And that goes back to a question, I believe, Justice Souter asked. In the Michigan case, a question was posed in an interrogatory, \"What enforcement by is done of in-state wineries.\" In that regard, the answer was, \"None.\"\n How do you count bottles? I would have thought the consumers have all the bottles. [Laughter.]\n That's exactly right. And, certainly in the directly shipping context in-state, that is emphatically the case.\n I think they were referring to full bottles. I guess [Laughter.]\n With direct shipping  \n They've all been drinking [Laughter.]\n to arbitrators.\n With direct shipping, Justice Scalia, we can personalize things. In terms of the Bacchus case, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, New York, like Hawaii, conceded protectionism. It is very rife in the legislative record in 1970, when the direct shipping was extinguished. In 1995, when Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have solved this problem, he said, and I quote and this is in the record, the Joint the Second Circuit Joint Appendix, at 442 he said, and I quote, \"Since the vast majority of this country's wines are produced in California, I believe that this bill would inevitably lead to a significant increase in mail-order wines from that state into New York. This increase could, in turn, lead to a decrease in sales for New York liquor stores and their distributors, and shrink New York wineries' market share. That is protectionism.\" And, finally, the notion that small winemakers could go to all 50 states and open offices in order to do this if you could drive out to Middleburg and visit Juanita Swedenburg's winery and she invites you to do so [Laughter.]\n you will find Mrs. Swedenburg selling wine, harvesting grapes, and bottling. This is a ban on this is market foreclosure, sure and simple fewer than 600 wineries are represented on the stores of New York's shelves, out of over 3,000 wineries  \n The question  \n in the United States.\n really is whether the plain language of the Twenty-First Amendment allows that very protectionism.\n And I would refer you, in my brief time remaining, to the brief, the Carter-Phillips brief for the Napa Valley Vintners Association, the DKT Liberty brief, which go into the history of the Twenty-First Amendment, which was intended to restore the police power, which did not include the power to discriminate. Our clients cannot compete with the liquor distributors in the political marketplace in their in their in their home states. They can, however, compete in the economic marketplace. The Commerce Clause protects that right, that level playing field. The Twenty-First Amendment was never intended to take it away. We ask this Court, respectfully, to honor 124 years of precedent in the National Economic Union. If there are no further questions, thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Bolick. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Petitioners submit that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits an employment practice that has a significant disparate impact on older workers if that practice lacks any reasonable business justification. The ADEA embodies Congress' determination that age discrimination seriously impedes older Americans' ability to participate fairly in the American work force.\n Mr. Goldstein, let me just interrupt a minute. You say if it lacks the the business justification. But is it not a part of that is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is it, that it does not show? That's an affirmative defense.\n Justice Stevens, there is not a clear answer to that question in all candor. It is not before the Court. I will tell you that the lower courts uniformly in the ADEA disparate impact context apply Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Watson and the Wards Cove rule rather than the post-1991 Civil Rights Act rule. That is a debatable proposition because, as your question suggests, in subsection (f)(1) of the statute where this provision comes from and let me just take us to the language. It would probably be most useful. In the blue book, the the blue petitioners' brief at page 1 are the relevant provisions. (a)(2) we'll come back to. That's the parallel language to Griggs. The reasonable factor other than age provision is (f)(1), and it says: it shall not be unlawful for an this is at the bottom of the page. It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited and I'm going to come back and focus on that under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age. The fact that it says otherwise prohibited seems to suggest that this is setting up an employer defense, as your question indicates. And the Court in the the Western Air Lines case in 1986 said that the BFOQ provision, which is in (f)(1) as well, is an affirmative defense. So I  \n You put your finger on exactly what's the part of this case that's bothering me. Read through the language. As you read through the language, disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this particular provision, reasonable factors other than age, seems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to disparate treatment. And that all seems to work. But you read the definition of reasonable factor other than age to mean business necessity or even Justice O'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough. It's hard for an employer to make that defense. And while making it hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly well. You start making it hard to make that defense here and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment of his or her employees is going to have a disparate impact in respect to age because the correlation with age runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other cases. So I can't believe that Congress really would have wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is because I can't believe the business necessity part of it. And so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the same time, pulls in disparate impact and business necessity, and now I don't know what to do.\n I can tell you. (Laughter.)\n The answer is that you should recognize, as does the commission, which has delegated rulemaking authority under the act, that business necessity, which is the term of art that they used in the regulation and we'll come back to it. It's at page 2 of the blue brief means different things in different contexts. And so I want to take you to the specific citations where the EEOC has recognized the common sense principle. We know that more things that are legitimate employer practices correlate with age than they do with race and gender. It is  \n Mr. Goldstein, before you do that, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this statute doesn't at least on on the page 1 part you called our attention to, doesn't refer to business necessity. That's in the EEOC regulation. If I were just reading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like an affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems like something quite different than necessity. It isn't necessary for the business to do this, but it's reasonable. And if that's then the business necessity it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper construction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when it referred to business necessity. They were thinking of Griggs and and title VII, but this statute says reasonable factors.\n Yes. Our position relies only on the statute. We embrace the text of the statute. (f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be reasonable. We agree with that. The point I would then take you to is that in if the Court were interested in the regulation we don't think it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it were, the EEOC has said that it too recognizes that the phrase, business necessity, in the context of the Age Act does not mean essential to the business. Let me tell you why it used the language it did, business necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up. And that is when this Court first used the words, business necessity, in Griggs and then subsequently in Wards Cove, it didn't have all the connotations that it does now as being quite a high employer burden. If I could just read to you two things from Griggs. Griggs said, the touchstone is business necessity. If the employment practice cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited. It simply required related to job performance. That's the backdrop on which the EEOC used the word.\n Well, I'm not sure you're right about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of what it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high school diploma. Now, an employer might well think I want to upgrade my work force. I want this to be a real classy work force. So I'm going to require a high school diploma. It isn't necessary, but why is it unreasonable for me to do that? So I I don't I think Griggs spoke about rules that were built in headwinds because a large part of the population didn't have the opportunity to get high school diplomas. That doesn't exist in the age discrimination area. So I I don't think that Griggs is an example of something that was a loose business necessity rule.\n My point is only terminological, and that is, when the EEOC used those words, it did not do so against a backdrop in which they carried a connotation that was necessarily very strict, and it has said several times and they are quoted in our brief that the standard and this is just the bottom line. I think it's a very important bottom line.\n You don't care about those regs anyway. Right?\n We do care about the regulations.\n Oh, you do. I thought you were saying you could make your case just on the  \n Well, we have  \n text of the statute.\n We can and will.\n Well, maybe you should because I'm not so sure that the EEOC interpretation is entitled to Chevron deference.\n We do believe that it is entitled to Chevron deference because they have delegated rulemaking authority and there is some suggestion that the because of language in subsection  \n But was this an actual rule after notice and comment, or is it a an interpretation?\n It is a post-notice and comment rule.\n But but it interprets doesn't interpret the prohibitory section. I mean, it it might be understood as simply making an assumption that, say, the Griggs rule would be applied in in this Court.\n It's conceivable you could read it that way, although the EEOC has specified many times, in the quarter century since it enacted the regulation, that no, when we and let me take us to the text to explain why, and that again is at page 2 of the blue brief. They said and this is the block quote. When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such practice has an adverse impact on individuals. That's the reference to disparate impact. The regulatory materials cite to Griggs. But in all events, I do want to come back to the bottom line, and that is the EEOC recognizes, we recognize that it's easier to prove either a defense or to put the burden on the plaintiff's case. It's a you have a higher hurdle  \n Easier easier is a matter of degree.\n Yes.\n And reasonable factor could be interpreted to say what the employer but the employer just doesn't like paying these executives so much money when these new younger janitors make so little. And so he says, I want to pay the new younger janitors more. Okay? There we've got it. Disparate impact.\n No.\n And now you say, what's the business necessity? And frankly, there wasn't one. It's just that I found it sort of bad. All right? So there we are. I've lost my case. Now, that's what is worrying me, and I thought perhaps this reg that seems to say and lower courts have accepted that I would lose my case that this reg is outside Congress' the agency's authority for that reason because Congress couldn't have intended that result.\n Well, let me take you to the lines of cases that I think might concern you. There were a set of cases before this Court's decision in Hazen Paper that involved two rules, Justice Breyer, and I will tell you that you referred to in the Adams oral argument when this case this issue came to you before. And so I want to refer to a very specific set of cases. There were a set of cases before 1993 in which there was some correlation. High salary correlated with age. And the courts of appeals, the Third the Second Circuit in the Geller case and the Eighth Circuit in the Leftwich case treated that as effectively a disparate treatment disparate treatment case because of the high level of correlation. The more recent cases reject that result and we embrace the more recent cases. And I want to cite them to you so you could look them up if you wanted. The Evers case, which is 241 F.3d 948; the Williams case, which is 112 F.Supp.2d 267; and the last one is Newport Mesa, 893 F.Supp 927. These cases recognized that cost is a perfectly legitimate business justification, and they put a single burden on the employer. Now, let me just just to say, most impact cases aren't cost cases, but I know it's a concern. They say, look, if you want to cut your costs and get rid of your more expensive work force, we're only going to ask you to do one thing, and that is allow your more senior workers to take a pay cut. They do not say, as did the older cases, that it causes disparate impact and you lose your case. And so we don't  \n Mr. Goldstein, you this is this case arises out of a compensation program of the employer, and why is it brought under 4(a)(2) instead of 4(a)(1) which addresses discrimination in compensation?\n Justice O'Connor, the lower courts unanimously conclude, as does the commission, that (a)(2), although it does not have the word compensation in it, does apply to compensation and  \n But why in light of 4(a)(1)?\n Because they understand 4(a) and let me take you everyone to the text just so we can all be literally on the same page, and that is going to be in the red brief at page 17a. It is 623(a), and it's the first block quote at the top of page 17a of the red brief. They understand that 623(a)(1) refers to actions against individuals, whereas 623(a)(2) refers to actions against groups, group policy versus individual action, and they do that because of the introductory language to (a)(1) and (a)(2), to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual; whereas, (a)(2) refers to limit, segregate, or classify his employees.\n May I ask a question at this point going really back to the question I asked you at the outset of the argument? If I thought seniority or years of service was a reasonable factor other than age and if I thought this particular compensation program was based on years of service rather than age, can I look at the reasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your complaint states a cause of action?\n Yes. Hazen Paper established that that is not  \n And if I do look at it and if I do come to the conclusion I've suggested, would I not have to dismiss your complaint?\n I may misunderstand the hypothetical, Justice Stevens.\n The hypothetical and I think it may be the case that you have a compensation program which uses years of service as a basis for classifying employees which has a disparate impact on older workers, but it does also it relies squarely on a reasonable factor other than age if you will call years of service such a factor.\n Yes. That's perfectly legitimate. That as I understand the hypothetical  \n suppose I want  \n I understand that to be this case.\n No, it would not because the rationale given by the employer here for let let me take us to the facts and then the explanation that's given by the employer. What happened here is they gave all of the line police officers much bigger raises than they gave to the more senior officers. That and the difference in pay between protected persons under the ADEA and non-protected persons was 4 standard deviations, a 1 in 10,000 chance, statisticians will tell you. And they said  \n No, but the basis for differentiation was years of service, was it not?\n The basis for differentiation was years of service, but the question is in is it a reasonable choice by the employer in this context. And the reason is it's a  \n Well, I'm just asking in the abstract. Why wouldn't that always be a a reasonable factor other than age?\n I apologize. That and so I think I answered your hypothetical too broadly. And that is, it depends. In the great majority of cases, employers certainly can say I want to give a class of employees more money. Perfectly sensible. Congress didn't intend to block that. But the question is, is this outside the usual set of cases? And the city's explanation what for this policy, which was to give the line cops more money but not the rest of the cops who happen to all be over 40, was that they wanted to bring the salary up to a a regional average. And so we asked the question, does this accomplish that in a reasonable way, and it does not because they left out huge categories of employees.\n But the factor if I understand it, it wasn't because they were line officers, it was rather because they had lesser years of service than the more senior officers.\n No.\n No.\n That is not the facts here. That's right. They they did not say we are going to give pay raises to the people who have lesser years of service because we're concerned about their pay. To the contrary. Let me take you to one piece of the record that I think will be helpful. Although again the cases presents the legal question, the lower court on remand can resolve the case. But at page 15 of the joint appendix, there is the pay plan itself, and the first sentence is that they explains the purpose. The the city wanted to provide a compensation plan that will attract and retain qualified people, and then it says, to all employees regardless of age. They purported to be giving the same treatment to everyone regardless  \n I don't think the statement of purpose tells me what the what the criterion for the different treatment was. I still think it was years of service.\n Justice Stevens, I I just think that it misunderstands the facts as I know them in this particular case.\n What was the criterion?\n The criterion was that they took the they had different kinds of officers. They had police line police officers, master sergeants, all the way on up through the system.\n So in other words, the criterion was the kind of rank they had before.\n Yes, and then  \n Why isn't that a reasonable factor other than age?\n The question is not whether that because that's not having those criterion is perfectly reasonable. The question is, is it reasonable and this would be resolved on remand to give raises to only one of those categories when your explanation is that you were trying to give raises to bring everyone up to a regional average? And so, Justice Stevens, I think  \n In other words, you say the the question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor other than age. Your question is whether the use of those factors was overall reasonable.\n Yes. There are two things.\n That's a rewriting of the statute.\n Oh, I I don't think so, Justice Stevens. It's the same question that we ask in title VII, and that is, was it a a there's a higher bar there, but were you pursuing a a legitimate goal and did you did you pursue it in a reasonable way? That's why a title VII plaintiff and this has and I do want to come back  \n Title VII doesn't have this language in it.\n That's absolutely right, but it's not language here that would detract from that structure of the of the title VII inquiry. All the lower courts, for example, agree that it as I said, follows the pre  \n Here you're saying you're not attacking reasonable factor other than age. It has to be based on reasonable factor other than age. And I take it here you're saying it's not based on what they advance as reasonable factors.\n Yes. They give  \n Is that right?\n Yes. They give an explanation.\n But if I I say my explanation for why I pay the newer people more is really I like to have that atmosphere. You make less money in my business, but it's more democratic and people are happier even though no one will invest in my company. (Laughter.)\n But still, I'd like a commune. All right? That's how I want to do it. Now, that's not totally idiotic. It's plausible. So I just win. Right?\n No. You would lose a treatment case.\n Ah, I lose a treatment case. No, no. I'm not I'm just it's I'm not paying the younger workers more. I'm paying the newer workers more. All right? They happen to be much the same category, but I I don't want it. It's not age. Or, you know, I pay the lower paid workers more. How's that? Do I win?\n You paid the lower paid workers more?\n Yes. I paid the lower paid workers more? I want to bring them up to the executives. I I like it. It's more democratic and it makes a happier group. And and so, now, do I win or lose?\n You, in all likelihood, win in that hypothetical. You  \n I win. And I don't have to say any more than that.\n No. But let me tell you, it's still a very important statute because for the reason that I framed before, and that is, most cases that are ADEA disparate impact cases are not cost cases. There are other tests: applications procedures, strength tests, and the like. That's what the EEOC believes is still very essential. So while we don't impose a big burden on employers in the cost context for the reasons that you and Justice Stevens have been exploring, that doesn't mean our position is somehow worthless. The EEOC has said that the disparate impact plays a, quote/unquote, vital role under the ADEA and that the respondents' position would greatly weaken the statute because  \n There haven't been a whole lot of cases under the impact theory as applied to age, and you just said you're not talking about the cost category but that you mentioned physical fitness. And there was a case. Smith against Des Moines involved that, but it was found the the physical fitness test was job-related. Have there been mutual rules with a disparate impact that you can give us as examples? When you're talking about race and sex, the examples come to mind much more readily than in the age category.\n Yes, I can. I'll give you two sets of examples. The first is the examples identified by the Solicitor General in his cert petition defending the EEOC's position in the Francis W. Parker case in 1994. The EEOC pursued cases and they're cited in the cert petition involving rules that prohibit that require recent college graduates to get a job that forbid hiring someone who worked previously for a higher salary than they would be getting in the new in the new job and that laid off people who would be eligible to retire soon. So those are the examples the Solicitor General gave. I'll give you two other examples. One is a a case called  \n These are examples of violations or things that are okay?\n Violations. I apologize. The EEOC filed suit because of these violations of the act.\n Why isn't it a reasonable factor other than age that I don't want to hire somebody who's going to retire a year after I hire him?\n Because it's not  \n Gee, that seems to me terribly reasonable.\n The  \n I don't care how old he is. I don't want anybody who's going to retire the year after I hire him. I don't want to have to go through this this whole process again.\n The view of the commission it's one I share, but a particular court might not is that that is not a good a reasonable work place judgment. One could disagree with it. But the those employees will be very valuable. And it's not that they will retire, I should make clear. It's that they're eligible to retire. It it may well be a different case if you could say, I asked the person. They said they're leaving in a year. The rule challenged there was mere eligibility to retire, and they did give the other examples. I didn't finish with the court cases. They are Klein, which is 807 F.Supp. 1517, which is a hiring test I think by the FAA in that case that that happened to exclude all of the people, I think, over the age of 55. And there are other cases that are, in the line of cases that I was discussing with Justice Breyer, in which the employer doesn't say doesn't give the person who gets the higher pay the option of taking a pay cut before being fired. So the statute, both in the non-cost context and the cost context, has very important applications. I did want to return to your correct premise, however, Justice Ginsburg. You said there aren't many cases. I think it's important to recognize that the the important, legitimate cases, by and large, are conciliated by the EEOC. Remember, it goes through an administrative process first. The EEOC found a violation here, gave us a right to sue letter. The the city just declined to settle with us. There have been and I have checked. There have been 74 disparate impact cases in the history of the statute that are reported in the Federal courts, and I think that is a good answer to the idea of the respondents that this will impose a huge burden on employers, the idea that there will be a massive amount of litigation. Remember  \n Well, once we if we were to say it's covered, don't you think that number would expand?\n It's possible it would expand some, but I do think we're right to say not much because  \n Well, it's not the number of cases either. I mean, you could have it wouldn't take much to have a single case that has a rule in it, say, that makes it very difficult for an employer to do things of type X or type Y, and that would have enormous impact even though you'd say, well, it was just one case.\n Well, there are two fears I think the respondents have articulated, neither of which are borne out by actual experience because, Justice O'Connor, the EEOC has recognized these claims for a quarter century. Until 1993, every single circuit agreed with us, and right now three circuits agree with us. So I there is a large body of experience that suggests and that's where those 74 cases come from. So, Justice Breyer, they have two concerns. One is the mere notion of the possibility of liability will and the prospect of how expensive litigation would be would be deterring valuable employment practices. That's not borne out by experience. Your point is, well, what if the liability threshold is too high? And experience suggests and the rules endorsed by the commission and the lower courts are that the liability threshold is not too high. I did also want to say that it is the liability threshold that is the key for deciding how to accommodate the respondents' concerns. Justice O'Connor's Watson plurality opinion explains that the evidentiary standards that apply in these disparate impact cases should serve as adequate safeguards. The precise, same argument was made by the business community in Watson, saying, look, we're going to have to adopt quotas. This will be entirely unmanageable. Before I sit down and reserve the remainder of my time, I did want to say we have a really good case, to refer back to my last argument, and that's Griggs, which is about the exact same statutory text. And then we have a line, a wall that is uninterrupted of this Court's authority. Six straight decisions say when the statute title VII says something and the ADEA says the same thing, they have the parallel construction. And in our view the respondents' arguments aren't good enough to overcome the double hurdle of stare decisis and Chevron deference. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.\n Mr. Nager.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: If I may, I'd like to go straight to the question as to why mere statistical correlations with age don't create a prima facie case of discrimination because of age. This Court in its title VII cases has said that a mere statistical correlation with race or sex can create a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or sex because it's advanced a proposition that there's no inherent correlation between race and sex and ability to perform a job or do a job. And as a consequence, the Court has said that a statistical disparity is a departure from the expected norm. Thus, the statistical disparity creates a suspect situation which could be treated as a prima facie case of discrimination because of age, to use the Court's term in Watson, the functional equivalent of intentional discrimination. In the age context, the premise doesn't apply. In the age context, as Justice Breyer pointed out in the Florida Power argument, as he's pointed out again today, age is inherently correlated with myriad selection practices. It's painful to say, particularly to a Court that's a little bit older than I am, but our mental and physical capacities are not constant over our lifetimes. They're different for each one of us, but statistically they change over time and they deteriorate over time, and progress doesn't treat the skills and abilities that we have with the same way to people who are at different stages in life. Our education and our technological  \n Verdi wrote Falstaff when he was 70 late in his late 70's. It was his greatest creation. Something.\n There is no doubt, particularly in occupations like judging (Laughter.)\n that experience and wisdom may be something that grow over a lifetime. But as we know  \n Wunsler died at about 28, didn't he?\n No. 34.\n 34, well  \n Let me let me ask you this. If if your argument has force, why haven't we been having horrible example piled upon horrible example since 1981 when the EEOC took the position that it takes?\n The answer to that is as follows, is that Justice Chief then Justice Rehnquist, now Chief Justice Rehnquist, wrote a dissent from denial at the time of Geller v. Markham. And in my practical experience and I do defend these cases for a living that put a tremendous chill on the plaintiffs bar, and there were very few of these cases brought. But contrary to Mr. Goldstein, who doesn't represent employers and help them plan their selection practices, employers made huge changes in the '80's and the early '90's until this Court's decision in Hazen Paper because employers were scared of these cases, and so employers started managing the numbers. There were a lot of reductions in force in the late '80's, as I'm sure this Court remembers, as our Nation went through a a industrial restructuring. And every one of those reductions in force, I had to sit down with my clients and break up the age of the work force into bands and see how people were going to be affected and move numbers. And the irony, of course, is is in doing that, employers adversely impact the very people who are benefited by the disparate impact doctrine under title VII because the Age Discrimination Act principally favors more senior, older white males, and when you try to manage your numbers so that you don't adversely impact older white males, what happens is is you adversely impact the new entrants to the work force who in the last 25 years have been much greater numbers of racial minorities and females.\n What do you do about the EEOC's regulation? Why isn't that why isn't that entitled to Chevron deference?\n Let me answer that. First of all, the the answer is, is you only get to Chevron deference if this statute is not subject to construction by this Court in phase one of Chevron. The first question is can this Court, looking at the language of the statute and the other legal materials, interpret the statute to have a single, reasonably clear meaning.\n How can we possibly say that it's not ambiguous when we have, in another context, interpreted the identical language to permit  \n Just the way this Court did last term in the General Dynamics case, which I realize you dissented on this point, Justice Scalia. But just last term in the General Dynamics case, this Court held that the phrase, because of age, is idiomatically and contextually different than the phrase, because of race or sex. And my point to Justice Breyer is is that the phrase, because of age, cannot properly be construed to be satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.\n In that in that case, we were construing the word age and age definitely has a different meaning from sex or or race.\n I'm not saying that the the General Dynamics case disposes of this case, Justice Stevens. I'm simply pointing out that, as Justice Souter's opinion for the Court last term held, that similar language in similar statutes can have different meaning and not be ambiguous.\n Yes, but not whole texts, not I don't remember whether it was (1)-(1) and (2) or (a) and (b), but this is not a word, age. It's it's lines and lines, and to and to say, oh, in Griggs we held that the title VII language this language means you can have a disparate impact theory, but in age, we're going to read those very same words to prohibit. In one sense one you read to say, these words permit disparate impact, and then you read the same words to say these words prohibit  \n No.\n disparate impact.\n That is not quite right, Justice Ginsburg. What we're saying is is that the natural meaning of the phrase, because of, either in title VII or in the Age Act, is a natural, more conventional reference to intent. Nonetheless, the Court, because of the objectives of title VII and because statistical correlations could equal a functional equivalent of intentional discrimination, construed title VII to go beyond intent-based claims to encompass disparate impact claims. Our point to the Court today is is that neither of those two critical premises apply, that a mere correlation with age does not, in the context of age, equal a prima facie case of  \n If that's so, Congress shouldn't have copied the language of title VII. It isn't a matter of it just accidentally comes out to to be sounding the same, as though, you know, two monkeys did it on a typewriter or something. They copied they copied title VII.\n Well, they copied it before Griggs was decided, indeed, before any agency of Government, before any court in this country, and before any academic in this country had floated the concept  \n Well, I think it's a fair conclusion that they meant the two to mean the same thing, whether it was before Griggs or after Griggs. They copied the language. It seems to me they wanted the two to mean the same.\n I I think that that's wrong, Justice Scalia.\n Or or at least it is arguably so, in which case you come back to my question. Why isn't the the EEOC's resolution of that ambiguity conclusive?\n Well, let me answer that question directly and then come back and argue with you about your premise. If you turn to the appendix and on the red brief, page 56a is the regulation. And it is as Justice Kennedy pointed out, it is not an interpretation of the prohibition of the statute. It is an interpretation of the reasonable factor other than age provision. And as an initial point, I'd submit to you, Justice Scalia, that it's one thing to defer to an agency's interpretation of the provision that you're being asked to construe in resolving what the meaning of the provision you're being asked to construe is. It's another thing to defer to their interpretation of a distinct provision which isn't a prohibition at all. Let me move on and let's read what it says, though. What it says is is the following. It's interpreting a phrase that says is based on a reasonable factor other than age, which Mr. Goldstein has conceded in his brief and the petitioners in the Florida Power case also conceded is necessarily a reference to intentionality. But there's not a word in this regulation about employer intentions. Quite the contrary. And the reason why I I asked you to turn to page 56a of our brief rather than the quotation of the regulation in Mr. Goldstein's brief is because there's an additional sentence in the regulation that Mr. Goldstein didn't print in his brief, and that is that the EEOC said where tests are involved  \n Where where are you reading from?\n Page 56a of the red brief. I'm sorry, Justice. It's section (d).\n (e)?\n (d) as in David. What the EEOC said is that the reasonable factors other than age provision is not an intent-based provision. It's a business necessity provision. They did it, saying it means the same thing as it's as it means in title VII because their whole purpose here was to conform the Age Act to title VII, and they said you have to comply, where tests are involved, with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection that they jointly promulgated with the Department of Labor, the Justice Department, and the Civil Service branch, whose name has escaped me right now.\n Mr. Nager, I'm lost. What what part of 56a are you referring to? (d)?\n (d) on page 56a. I'm sorry?\n Does it say what you just said?\n Tests which are asserted the last sentence. Tests which are asserted as reasonable factors other than age will be scrutinized in accordance with the standards set forth at part 1607 of this title. Part 1607 of this title is the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection.\n All that's true, but they they did promulgate this guideline, as far as I looked it up. At that time, they said, look, it's going to be disparate impact, and they cited Griggs. And people have put comments, which I haven't read yet, but I imagine the comments went to disparate impact. And then when they rewrote it in this form, they have a little paragraph of explanation which makes pretty clear it's meant to be disparate impact.\n I have no doubt that they were assuming that this Court's decision in Griggs because this is what they said in their comments this Court's decision in Griggs required disparate impact analysis  \n Well, all right. But I mean, they everybody knew what they were driving at at the time they promulgated this. So it seemed to me that if if we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the reg is outside the statutory authority. And it might be outside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too tough a test.\n It's it's outside the the statutory authority for two reasons.\n But now we've heard it doesn't embody that much of a tough test, and you know, the EEOC isn't here to tell us  \n Well  \n what in fact it thinks.\n Mr. Goldstein cited a bunch of EEOC briefs in his brief, and you'll notice he didn't quote a single part of of those EEOC briefs which say that the standard under the Age Act is less than the standard under the Age Act. What he cites to is a footnote in his opening brief where he quotes one sentence from an EEOC brief where an EEOC appellate lawyer said it is is likely that an employer will be able to prevail more often. The EEOC never said and and I litigate against them. I can tell you the only thing that they would hate less but hate a lot than your ruling in our favor that there's no disparate impact claims at all is that Mr. Goldstein has represented what their version of the defense is because that's not the Government's position.\n All right. So we don't know what the Government's position is. They're not here. So suppose I think, one, the language is against you, the language of the statute. I do think it's against you. Two, the EEOC reg does foresee a disparate impact test. Three, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and that has to go with the scope of the statute. And four, it might be possible for the EEOC to write a reg that deals with the problems you're worried about while advancing a disparate impact test. Suppose I think all those things  \n Which one  \n which are at least consistent. What would I do with this case? That's my problem.\n Okay. I I would submit that you should  \n Where the Government hasn't appeared and told us what they want to do or what they think should be done, et cetera.\n I I should I would submit, Justice Breyer, that you should reexamine your premise that the language of the Age Act, both in section 4(a) by itself and construed in light of 4(f) and the legislative history and purposes of the statute encompass disparate impact claims.\n Maybe the EEOC regulation was not so much an interpretation of the statute as an interpretation of Griggs.\n Oh, I think that's  \n I mean, maybe this provision represents the judgment of the agency that Griggs applies to this other statute, and and I'm not sure that we owe Chevron deference to that determination.\n Well, I I don't think you did, although I don't even think, frankly, from what I've read is they made the judgment. They made the assumption.\n Yes, well.\n Mr. Nager, will you go to another one of Justice Breyer's premises? He says following the practicalities are with you, which you're certainly going to accept. He says I think the EEOC can deal with some of these practical problems. Do you think so? Why not?\n Great question and the answer is no, they can't. And the reason is  \n Give me some examples.\n The reason is is because if you if you lower the prima facie case so that it's meaningless, so that it means that all a plaintiff has to do is find a selection practice because it's always going to correlate with age it means you shifted the burden to an employer in every case to establish that its its practice meets whatever standard your hypothesizing the EEOC might come up with later, Justice Breyer. Meanwhile, the world has to go on, and what my clients will do is as follows. They will say, well, you know, we're not going to wait to see if if this new practice we're going to consider is going to stand the test of time in court and under the EEOC's yet-to-be-articulated regulation. We're going to stick with the tried and true. We are not going to innovate at all, and if we're going to innovate, we're going to massage the numbers while we do it. The employers  \n That would be a fairly easy burden a fairly easy burden to meet. And and to give you a fairly easy burden is consistent with the idea of trying to get employers to think about the problem. An employer who uses a different factor which is correlated with age but it's it's an unreasonable thing to do or it isn't the real basis hasn't thought about the harm that he's working.\n Well, as  \n So we could give you an easy burden and still accomplish the objective.\n I I don't want to resist the easy burden, but I do want to tell you, as Justice Scalia pointed out in the Florida Power argument, my clients do think about these things because if you know, if they adopt an unreasonable practice that has an adverse statistical effect and they think they're likely to get sued about it, they actually do have to worry about it because these cases are tried to juries and they have to have a reasonable explanation for what their practice because they get tried to juries as disparate treatment cases. Our point is not that statistics are not admissible. They are. Our point is is that they're not sufficient by themselves to create a prima facie case of because of age, as it would be in a title VII case where we wouldn't expect to see the statistical disparity. So it's fair to say that there's a reasonable adverse inference to be drawn from the existence of the disparity itself. That is the premise articulated by this Court as to why the disparate impact doctrine can can at the prima facie case aspect of it equals a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or sex. That is not true here. Now, it is also the case that when this Court adopted the disparate impact doctrine, it said it placed an enormous weight on the objectives of title VII's prohibitions, which it construed to be, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, eliminating these built-in headwinds. Well, when when the Secretary of Labor proposed the Age Discrimination Act, he gave a report to Congress and he said age discrimination is different than race and sex discrimination. It is not based on animus. It is it is not dealing with a group of individuals who have suffered cumulative disabilities over their lifetime because of historic discrimination. He said it's the problem of age discrimination is the problem of over-generalization by an employer.\n But he gave the very same example that was Griggs. He gave the example of the high school diploma because he thought that people of a certain age, when there wasn't such general education as there is today, might not have a high school diploma to a much higher extent than the people who came the generation who came after.\n But his solution was not a disparate impact doctrine. His solution was  \n Well, it's a little, and you said his solution was we're going to have training and manuals and all. But that's not altogether clear.\n Well, take a look at the statute, Justice Ginsburg. Please look at page 15a and 16a in the red brief. And if you look at section 621(b) it's at the bottom of page 15a of the red brief Congress said what the purposes of the Age Discrimination Act were, and it had three, but it's only addressed one through the prohibition. The second one was to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment. The other two were to promote employment of older persons based on ability and to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment. And if you turn the page and look at section 622(a)(1), the very first thing Congress mandates that the Secretary shall do to address its other two purposes, to undertake research and promote research with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older persons and the promotion of measures for using their skills. What the Secretary of Labor's report goes on at length about is it identifies all kinds of factors, neutral and non-neutral  \n But it doesn't say there that that is to implement the first that that only the second one, to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination.\n It does what it you're right it doesn't say the following. It doesn't say, and we don't want disparate impact, because in 1967 the the concept of disparate impact as a legal theory was unknown to Congress, to the courts, and to the administrative agencies. But what the Secretary of Labor did do in his report is, after identifying all of the problems that adversely affect older workers, he says, I recommend a two-pronged approach. One prong is prohibitory. It's coercive. You shall not we'll prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment, which the Secretary explained to Congress, and this Court last term said itself, means a is a is is the use of age as the decision-making criteria. He said, separately we should have a series of programs that seek to enlarge the abilities of older workers, that seek to educate employers about the abilities of older workers through non-coercive programs. And so what this statute does and this Court has said it in several of its cases this statute was based upon the Secretary of Labor's report. The Secretary wrote the bill, and although Congress amended it in other ways, it didn't amend any of these provisions. That this statute took a more nuanced approach to deal with a distinctly different problem, and the problem  \n Mr. Nager, at the end of his report, Secretary Wirtz said the a purpose, to eliminate discrimination in the employment of older workers, it would necessary not only to deal with overt acts of discrimination, but also to adjust those present employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring. And your point, as I understand it, yes, that was one of his purposes, but he meant that one to be accomplished with ERISA and other things like that.\n Well, the quote that you just gave says that there are express uses of age and there are non-age reasons that lead to the use of express limits of age, for example, the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave with Mr. Goldstein, saying, well, I wouldn't want to hire someone who's going who tells me they're going to retire a year from now. But if he said I'm not going to hire you because you're 64 because I know you're going to people retire at 65 mostly, that would be the same kind of non-age-based motive that nevertheless used age as a decision-making criteria. That's what that quote is referring to. If you if you the second half  \n The quote the reference to employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring. I see what you're saying.\n Right. And then and and the point here is this was thought out. It wasn't thought out as disparate treatment versus disparate impact because the concepts didn't exist at the time, but it was thought out as arbitrary age discrimination versus other factors that adversely bear on older workers. The prohibitions went to arbitrary age discrimination and didn't go to the adverse impacts. It was the the non-coercive measures that went to the adverse impacts. Let me go also  \n No how does that work? Because the the particular language, it shall be unlawful for an employer to classify his employees in any way that would adversely affect an individual's status his status, it says as an employee because of such individual's age. Now, that sounds as if it's driving right at disparate impact. It's it's unlawful to classify an employee in any way that would adversely affect him because of his age. That's what it says. And then you turn to the defense and it says, but there's the defense with a differentiation, i.e., the classification is based on reasonable factors other than age. And therefore it would sound as if it says, look at the factor and ask is the factor reasonable. If so, the employer wins if it's really based on that factor.\n Two points?\n Yes.\n One is is  \n How do we get out of that language?\n Well, we love the language. We don't have to get out of it. It says because of age. That's a reference, a traditional, conventional reference  \n No, no, but it says it says that would adversely affect him because of his age.\n Well, the first before the comma is the statement both of the action of the employer and the injury that it has to cause in order for a claim to exist, and then there's another requirement. The requirement is is that the action and the the effect of the injury that's affected by it be because of age. That is a conventional reference to intent. And the confirmation that it's a reference  \n Oh, no. It's not intent because to read it as part of classifying, which you'd have to do to get it because of intent, you'd have to say to classify his employees because of such individual's age. Now, that's a little tough because you're talking about employees, and then you go to such individual.\n It it the phrase, because of age, modifies all of the words that precede the comma that separates the two.\n Segregate or classify. You want to read it all the way up back to segregate or classify.\n Well, I I think it does modify the verb, but  \n It would be good if you had a comma after employees. I I might go along with you if there was a comma after to limit, segregate, or classify his employees, comma, in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of opportunities or otherwise affect his status as an employee, comma, because of such individual's age go way back to before the comma. I can see that, but without the comma, that's that's an awful travel back to limit, segregate, or classify.\n Well, I I think that's the grammatically correct way to read it. But even even if it was just modifying the adversely affect  \n It would be the natural way.\n it would still be because of age.\n The natural way wait. The natural way is to read it as modifying to deprive  \n Right.\n or otherwise adversely affect.\n Exactly.\n That's the natural way to read it.\n It is.\n Now  \n One still  \n suppose we read it that way. Then what do you say?\n You even if you read it that way, it still says, comma, because of age, and the because of age is a reference to intent, and the confirmation of that, Justice Breyer, is the defense that you keep pointing to because as Mr. Goldstein conceded in his brief and as you pointed out in your questioning, it says, is based on. That is also a reference to intent. This statute is preoccupied with intent. What section 4(f) was about was identifying the situations in which age would be used but it, nonetheless, wouldn't even be arbitrary  \n Indeed, and I guess what supports that reading is that intent intent to discriminate in hiring the intentional discrimination because of age in hiring is covered by (2) rather than (1) isn't it?\n No, no, no.\n You think I mean, if if you have a rule if you have a rule that you won't hire any employee I mean, we we were talking earlier about the the reason (2) reads employees in the plural, and (1) reads refuse to hire or discharge any individual. So if you have any intentional discrimination that is against a class, it comes under (2) rather than (1).\n I had never thought of construing the  \n Is that wrong? Well, I thought I thought that's what what counsel for the petitioner was telling us.\n Well, if if he did, he's only strengthened our case. What I want to say to the Court is is that both of those provisions are modified by the phrase, because of age. This Court in Hazen Paper construed the because of language in 4(a)(1) as a reference to intent and said statistical correlations with age are not sufficient to establish because of age within the meaning of section 4(a)(1). And the presumption of uniform usage we're entitled to point to it as well that the presumption of uniform usage which would be that the phrase, because of age, in section 4(a)(2) is also not satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age. And the reason why title VII is different than the Age Act I keep coming back to this because this is so critical, Justice Breyer is that the premise of the Court's statistical cases under title VII is that it's it presumes that there's no inherent difference in ability between the races and the genders, whereas you know and I know that there is a difference in an an inherent correlation between abilities and skills, between people of different ages statistically. And so that whereas in the in the race and sex context, a statistical disparity by itself points out that there's something suspect and so would justify putting the employer to the burden on those occasions which would happen. And by definition, I think you and I both think, Justice Breyer, that it's not all that often that you're going to have these statistical disparities in the race and sex context. In the age context, they happen all the time. So it's it there's no basis for suggesting that a statistical correlation by itself creates something suspect, and it would rob the notion of a prima facie case of any meaning to say that that a statistical correlation with age, which we expect to see all the time, would establish a prima facie wrong. And, of course, the Secretary of Labor wrote a report telling Congress that race and sex were different than age for this very reason.\n But in your view, is based on reasonable factors other than age strictly an affirmative defense?\n I I think that it is it was intended to address mixed motive cases. That's why it was added. I think it is a indicia of the fact that this statute is concerned with intent in its prohibitions only. I'm not saying it's conclusive of that, but I'm saying it's another indicia, that if you look at all of section 4(f), it's about the instances in which age is being used  \n But is it an affirmative defense?\n I I don't think that it is, and I I  \n Well, did you challenge the sufficiency of this complaint on the ground that it did not allege that the the program was not based on was based on factors that were unreasonable?\n I I didn't handle the case in the trial court, but I believe that the our our client denied all of the allegations in the complaint and affirmatively said this was its salary program was a reasonable factor other than age, yes. And certainly in the courts below, the reasonable  \n What I'm trying to think through is whether that issue is one that can be resolved on the pleadings, or does it always require a trial.\n Well, I think the question of whether or not the reasonable factor other than age provision, when read in conjunction with section (a)(4) 4(a) shows that this is an intent-based statute, as a pure legal question, can be judged on the pleadings. The the question of whether or not a in a particular fact situation something is a reasonable factor other than age or not I think would be subject to what the proof is. It might be undisputed.\n On your reading, I just don't see that there's any function. I mean, if disparate impact is out of it, then then what work is there for the reasonable factor other than age to do?\n It was added in as a safe harbor to address mixed motive cases. There was a concern at the time that since employers had been using age as the decision-making factor, that they would continue to think about it, and the question was raised, well, would that mean that the very fact they thought of it, even though they had a nondiscriminatory reason, mean that they still violated the act? And the Secretary said, no, we've put in this reasonable factor other than age provision to make it clear. It it was simply a safe harbor.\n Thank you, Mr. Nager. I think you've answered the question. Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes, and let's make it 4 and a half.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. I want to start with our affirmative case which is one of stare decisis and then go to what I think is the thing that might concern the Court and that's the practicalities of implementing our rule. Our stare decisis case I think is fairly decisive. The language of title VII was the model for the ADEA. It runs all the way through the same in subsection (a)(2). This Court construed the text of the statute to give rise to disparate impact liability, and there are six cases of this Court that say when the language is the same, because one was derived from the other, we give them the same meaning. Now, I take it that the respondents have three answers to that. The first is they attempt to rewrite the rationale of Griggs and say Griggs really isn't so much about the text of the statute. It's what Congress was getting after, and this Court in Griggs was principally concerned with the fact that, look, in the context of age and sex discrimination, there's no legitimate correlation between an a disparate impact and a legitimate employer policy. That is not, in fact, what the rationale of Griggs is. The rationale of Griggs is that it doesn't matter to the employee if you are purposefully discriminated against or accidentally discriminated against. Congress was concerned with the effects of discrimination. And this Court reached that conclusion based on the text of the statute. If I could read from Griggs, quote, the objective of Congress in the enactment of title VII is plain from the language of the statute. That's the same language as in our statute. The thrust of section 703(a)(2) was to address, quote, the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation. This Court subsequently reiterated twice that disparate impact comes from the text of the statute, not from the air. Those two cases are quoted at page 9 of our reply brief and they resolve all doubts about commas and because of or anything like that. The Court in both Connecticut v. Teal and Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Watson tied it directly to the statute. If I could just read the Watson example. Again, they're quoted in full. In disparate impact cases, quote, the employer's practices may be said to, quote, adversely affect an individual's status as an employee because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Now, the second argument they have and this was the Fifth Circuit's argument is the RFOA provision exists in the ADEA, not in title VII. I do not understand how the RFOA provision if it means anything, it doesn't help us. Again, let me take you back to the text. It's on page 1 of the blue brief. It's in a few other places, but it's there. It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age. The necessary premise of that provision is that something will be otherwise unlawful when it's based on something other than age. It can't be talking about disparate treatment. The only kind of liability that involves factors other than age is impact. And then on top of that, Congress required that the employer's conduct be reasonable.\n What of dual motive?\n Because the statute refers to something otherwise unlawful, it can't be talking about Price Waterhouse mixed motive. Price Waterhouse mixed motive cases establish liability; i.e., you're not liable if you had another reason for doing it. But the premise of (f)(1) is that it's already otherwise unlawful, this is a defense to that. The third thing that they say is that in Hazen Paper this Court construed the because of language in (a)(1) not to refer to impact. The critical difference is that the (a)(1) language does not include the the clause that refers to the impact on the employee that Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer talked about with Mr. Nager. They're structured very differently. As to the practicalities, let me just say this has been the rule for a quarter century of the EEOC. It was the rule in every circuit until 1993. It is still the rule in three circuits. The notion that there is a big problem with administering it and that the EEOC can't recognize the as it has in all the examples we cite, that it's easier for an employer to prevail in the ADEA context is not accurate. I also want to just agree with Justice Breyer, that an important part of impact liability is just making employers think about it. And that comes from Justice Kennedy's opinion in McKennon where he said that disparate impact, quote, acts as a spur or catalyst to cause employers to self-examine and self-evaluate their employment practices to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of discrimination.\n Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the Beef Promotion and Research Act in 1985 in the midst of a serious depression in the beef industry. The beef industry found itself unable to respond to that situation through the promotion of its products. Congress responded to that situation by establishing a government program of promotion, research, and consumer information. In the Beef Act, Congress prescribed the central message for advertising under the Act, Congress established a government body, the Beef Board, to administer and implement the program, and it placed the program under the control of a Cabinet officer, the Secretary of Agriculture.\n Mr. Kneedler, will you tell us how this case differs, if it does, from what was before the Court in United Foods? What meaningful distinctions do you find?\n Well, the important distinction is that the two grounds that on which we are defending the statute here were not addressed in United Foods. In particular, the government speech argument, that what I've just said goes to, that the Court specifically did not address because it had not  \n We've never addressed that in  \n In none of these cases, and  \n in these cases  \n Right.\n have we?\n The Court has not. And we think that that is the critical point about this about this case and these programs, these are government these are programs of government speech. As I said, Congress, itself, prescribed the central message. Congress established the government board, all of whose members are appointed by the Secretary, to administer it.\n Does it remain government speech even if you don't say, \"This is your government speaking\"?\n It  \n If you say, you know, \"America's cattlemen are speaking,\" is it government speech?\n It does for purposes of this Court's government speech doctrine, it does. And I think  \n Why is that? I mean  \n And the Court the Court's decision in Rust, I think, is the best illustration of that.\n Yes, but Rust did not Rust was not a case in which the doctor was saying, \"This is my personal opinion, not the government's.\" And here, as Justice Scalia pointed out, there is an affirmative effort to say, \"This is this is paid for by\" whatever it's called, the cattlemen's group or the beef group, which affirmatively indicates that it's not government speech.\n Well, it all those statements say and there are advertisements in the record that say that the advertising is funded by America's beef producers, which is, of course, accurate, because they  \n Well, it's accurate  \n they pay for it.\n but it also contains the implication that who he who pays is the person whose speech is being broadcasted.\n Well, but, again, in Rust, the doctor who spoke I think the patient who went to see the doctor for counseling would have would have assumed or believed that the doctor was in the immediate encounter, that the doctor was speaking, and yet the Court, in its subsequent cases, has regarded Rust as a situation of government speech. But the important point about what you've just asked is that any concerns about the tag line in the advertising does not go to the constitutionality of the statute or the beef order. Neither the Act nor the order requires that in the advertising. And if the Court was to perceive that as a problem, the right remedy would not be to invalidate the Act, but to, instead, provide that there should be some different identification  \n Yes, but some people  \n on the advertising, itself.\n may be more resistant to an to an ad that says, \"Your government wants to eat wants you to eat more meat,\" than they are to an ad which say, \"The meat producers would like you to eat more meat.\"\n Well, I and I think in Rust, some people would have been resistant to the idea that your government wants you to engage in family planning, but what the what the Court said about Rust was that the government had established a program with a central message about counseling. That was then carried out by private individuals. Here, this case is much stronger than Rust.\n Well, but if you if you say the Act can be say, because this is just an as-applied challenge, you're asking us to assume that we can put on a label that's not true, \"This message is brought to you by your friendly Department of Agriculture.\" That isn't accurate.\n Well, it would be accurate  \n And you're having us save the statute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.\n Well, they're I'm sure that a label could be devised that would that would be accurate. The first of all, they are approved specifically approved by the Department of Agriculture. The certainly, the Act and regulations provide that the Secretary must approve every contract, every project for advertising. And, beyond that, the USDA approves all advertising, all copy  \n But, Mr. Kneedler  \n that is actually to be used, so there is specific approval by the Secretary.\n But there is there's another tape put out by the government, on meat, and that what is the government speech? Usually, the government has a position, and is presenting it. Here, we have America beef producers has a label on \"Eat meat.\" But if you went to the Surgeon General, probably that message would be \"Eat meat moderately.\" So what is the government speech? I don't know another case involving a claim of government speech where the message that you are saying is the government's is not the message that the government is putting out when it's dealing with its concern for public health.\n Well, the government, in the concern in situations where it may be concerned about public health, doesn't say, \"Don't eat meat.\" It there may be nutritional standards. And USDA does have nutritional standards that it advises people to adhere to. But what the government is doing here is facilitating a situation, facilitating promotion of a commodity. There is a structural defect in a market like a market for a fungible commodity, and I think it's important to understand what Congress was responding to here. When you have a fungible commodity, when you have a lot of small producers, no one of those producers has an incentive to advertise  \n Mr. Kneedler, is meat fungible? Or I think there are some steak houses that might disagree with that.\n Well, there are there are there are, to be sure, different cuts of meat, but the but the basic  \n I mean, even quality of meat within the some is tougher than others.\n Well  \n It's not like milk or wheat.\n But Congress could reasonably determine, under this statute, that there are that there are that beef has many things in common, that it is a generic problem or generic food or generic commodity, and the industry  \n At some level, it certainly is, I suppose. But, just as in wheat or corn, there are different brands and different qualities. But I suppose it's still fungible, in a broad sense.\n It is fungible in  \n May I ask you whether, in deciding the government's speech doctrine, is it the Secretary's formal right to control, as set out in the statute, that we look to, or do we look to the Secretary's actual record of oversight and participation?\n We think the we think the formal legal control is sufficient. And it the Secretary has the responsibility to approve under the statute to approve budgets, to approve contracts, and to approve projects. And USDA does, in fact, go beyond that and determine whether particular advertisements will be will be issued. But we think it's only necessary to look what the statute requires. But the testimony in this case shows that, in any event, USDA is extensively involved in the development of the advertising under this statute, by extensive consultations with the Operating Committee and the Beef Board in the development of the project. So there this is an integrated effort within the Department of Agriculture.\n Is it at all possible to do here what has been done in the union cases, where I mean, it's pretty hard for me to believe that there aren't that meat that cattle growers don't, by and large, like beef. I mean, maybe they have a ideological objection to people eating beef, but I doubt it. They probably object to some content. So can you segregate that? I mean, in the union cases, the bar cases, they try to segregate where there really is an ideological objection from the cases where really all that the objector wants is not to pay the money. And so they work out a system. You know, you pay so much for your dues anyway, you just don't pay that pro rata amount, where you really have an ideological objection.\n Well, I think that  \n Is it possible to work that out?\n What has what has been proposed by the by the Respondents in this case, of course, is to make it voluntary, so that people  \n Yes, but, I mean, if you make it  \n can opt out.\n totally voluntary, what you're going to discover is, all of a sudden, the beef people, rather than write a check, will say, \"Oh, you know, I make I raise cattle, but I don't think people should eat beef.\"\n Well  \n That saves them the money.\n Well, and I  \n And I tend to doubt that that's their view.\n Well, and  \n Some may view object to certain content. So I'm asking if it's feasible to work out  \n I think it I think it would not be feasible. It would it would enmesh the Department in difficult judgments and time-consuming  \n It would be in the union cases, it's hard enough. It's a the good-of-the-order exception is the way it works in the union. And in the bar thing, I think it would be hard to  \n Absolutely. And the Court made a similar point in Southworth, where it specifically declined to impose, on the university, a requirement to make judgments that would enable people to opt out in particular cases. And we think that the problem here would be even greater. But they would be particularly great under Respondents' proposal that individuals who don't want to pay, without even having to express an objection, because the whole system would collapse. This is a classic collective-action, free-rider problem.\n Mr. Kneedler  \n What the numbers  \n can I come back to Rust versus Sullivan? You say that that was a government speech case? I had not recollected it as a government speech case.\n This Court  \n This is government subsidizing speech by private organizations, and it chose to subsidize one type of speech, but not another.\n Yes  \n Did we say, in the opinion, that this was  \n Not in Rust, but in the Court's subsequent cases, Rosenberger, Southworth in particular, in Velazquez this Court said that Rust has come to be understood by the Court as a government speech case, because the government prescribed the message, and it's government speech whether or not the government speaks for itself or enlists others to transmit the message.\n Well, for the precise purpose at issue here, I think it makes a lot of difference. You can fund private people for some things, and not fund them for others, and it doesn't make whatever they say government speech. I think that's a  \n But  \n I think that's a really  \n but there's really no  \n strong proposition, that whenever you're subsidizing any private enterprise, the speech of that private enterprise becomes public speech.\n There's really no need to get to that point here, because the Beef Board, which is the entity that does the speaking, is, I think, unquestionably a government body. It's established by special statute under the Lebron test. All of its members are appointed by the  \n That's fine. But what you were using Rust for was to establish the proposition that in order to be government speech, it you don't have to you don't have to say, \"This is the government speaking.\"\n Well, I think  \n And Rust doesn't stand for that.\n Right I think, as this Court has come to explain Rust, as being a species of government speech but, as I say, there is no need there is no need for the Court to get to that situation. And the fact that the government is the one in control of the speech here critically distinguished distinguishes this case from cases like Keller and Abood.\n This is a question perhaps more for the Respondent than for you, but I would like your comment on it. Suppose the statute were changed and there was a dollar-a-head assessment on beef, and it just went into the general funds of the United States Treasury, and then they used part of that money they had more money for beef advertising, and the government did the advertising. What would the Respondents say about that?\n I think I think they would say that that that there's something different about general taxes and excise taxes or focus taxes. But I don't think there's any basis in this  \n But why can't  \n in history or  \n why can't you just do that? Or is your answer to me, \"Well, then, it's just formalism, and you might as well rule for me now?\"\n I'm sorry, do maybe I misunderstood your question.\n Why can't the government  \n Were you asking why focus  \n why can't the government adopt my solution?\n Well, I and maybe I misunderstood. Was it was it paying for it out of general taxes or taking this money and putting into the focus  \n It's put into the general fund of the of the Treasury.\n I they may say that that's the same thing, but I they were drawing a distinction between paying for it out of general funds income tax or something that we all would pay for. They say that's the solution, rather than having the industry, that benefits from the advertising, pay for it. Not only does the industry benefit  \n But then you'd come within the protections of Frothingham versus Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon, if you did it that way.\n Yes, there would be standing objection objections at that point, but we think, in terms of the merits of the argument, the notion that a person would have a First Amendment objection to paying an excise tax because of the uses to which the excise taxes are being put is really extraordinary and finds no basis in cases like Abood and Keller, which have to do with private association an association with private speech  \n But then you could  \n no government speech.\n simply restructure this Act to get to the result you want.\n Yes. If that but the funds that are raised are public monies. They don't go in they're not deposited in the Treasury. But in the Joint Appendix, there is a reproduced an AMS, Agricultural Marketing Service, circular that explains how these public monies and calls them \"public monies\" are to be disposed of. And it describes the Beef Board, this governmental body that receives the money, as being the custodian for the Agricultural Marketing Service and handling these monies. And Congress and the Secretary have imposed strict limitations on how those funds can be deposited. So whether they go into the general Treasury or whether they're handled in this way is really a matter of fiscal and revenue and internal governmental policy that I don't think that  \n Mr. Kneedler, this theory is one that wasn't brought up at all in Wileman, if I remember correctly. And in United Foods, it was brought up too late, so the government so the Court didn't entertain it. The argument that you're making today, I take it, would necessarily displace United Foods as having any kind of a continuing  \n Yes, because the government did not reach the government speech or the Court did not reach the government speech argument in United Foods. And, in fact, United Foods is back, on remand. That was a reversal of summary judgment for the government. It's back, on remand, and is being stayed, pending the outcome of this case on government speech. So there would not be an inconsistent result in  \n You wouldn't want to treat beef and mushrooms inconsistently. [Laughter.]\n Well  \n But there is  \n I think  \n the public perception of these ads it says, \"Eat meat\" it's quite different from saying, \"Your government wants you to buy meat.\" And the United States isn't saying that. So  \n But what the what the United States is doing is responding to this classic collective-action problem by establishing a government program to meet the situation where the industry, itself, will is unable to conduct the advertising because of because of, what I said, the fungibility of the product  \n But then  \n and all.\n isn't it more realistic to describe this as the government facilitating the private speech of the many people in this industry who don't have a big budget to advertise on  \n I think  \n on their own?\n doctrinally, it is government speech. It has the it has the benefit of enabling the promotion that would have happened in the industry, but for the collective-action problem to occur. But it is government speech under this Court's decision. If I may  \n Do you want to save your time?\n Please.\n Mr. Garre.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The First Amendment does not prevent the government from speaking out in order to revive and expand the market for the nation's most important agricultural product.\n If we can just continue on government speech, because that's where  \n Yes.\n where we left off. It seems to me there is something offensive about making a particular portion of the public pay for something that the government says.\n Justice Kennedy  \n It ought to be out of the general fund.\n Justice Kennedy, the assessments in this case are imposed on a class of people who sell particular commodity cattle. In that respect, they're no different than the types of assessments the Federal Government has been imposing for centuries on the same of commodities, from the first tax the Federal Government imposed on whiskey to the excise taxes on gasoline producers today. And Respondents concede you could do this out of general tax revenues. They concede that you could have a government speech program funded by excises on certain commodities, like cigarettes or alcohol. There is no basis under the First Amendment to carve out a different rule in the case of beef.\n What I'm saying, it seems to me that the government speech doesn't seem to me to advance your argument very much, because it has problems of its own.\n Well, we agree with the government speech doctrine, although we also think that the Court can uphold the statute under the intermediate-scrutiny analysis. It makes perfect sense for the government to be speaking out in order to correct the market problem that Congress identified in the midst of a two-decades-long depression in the beef industry. Take the BSE incident last year. BSE imposes a potentially catastrophic and overnight impact on the beef industry. In response to that threat, because of the beef checkoff program, the government was able to respond immediately with the funds necessary to respond on a national scale, not only through promotion and this is an important part in which this case is different from United Food only about half of every checkoff dollar goes to promoting beef through commercial advertising, like the \"Beef, it's what's for dinner\" campaign. The rest of that dollar goes to things like producing information to consumers about the safety of U.S. meat, the addressing the health concerns imposed by BSE and other potential diseases, like E. coli; going to open up foreign markets so that we can export beef beef exports have risen dramatically under this program and going for things like research in order to identify an early-detection system for BSE. In United Foods, this Court emphasized, at least three times throughout its opinion, that the only aspect of the program that was the dollar was being collected for was commercial advertising. And, Justice Stevens, I think you emphasized that in your concurrence, as well. And this program is much more holistic  \n Yes, but, I mean, that the part that's good can't save the whole thing, any more than in the in the union case, the fact that some the union dues could be used for some permissible purposes, saved the dues that were being used for impermissible purposes. You  \n Well, the union  \n You don't want to just save half of this program, do you?\n Well, certainly saving half is better than scuttling the whole  \n Oh, all right.\n thing, Justice Scalia. But the union case is the speech that was that this Court held could not be funded and, after all, in those cases, the message was controlled by a non-government entity, the union or the state bar. But there, you're talking about political and ideological speech. Here, we're talking about beef production producing  \n Well, what's the objection to, whenever you have an ad, you put a little thing in the corner, and it says, \"This advertisement is paid for by the beef industry under a regulation, X-23, of the Department of Agriculture\"?\n Justice Breyer, the program would do that if this Court held it was necessary  \n And it wouldn't  \n under the First Amendment.\n tough, would it?\n But  \n All you'd have to do is have a little thing and it would just say, \"USDA requires this, under the program,\" and then the whole problem goes away.\n That's correct. But let me make a few additional  \n All right.\n points. First, as Mr. Kneedler emphasized, nothing in the statute, the regulation, requires the ad to say that they're funded by America's beef  \n Well, I we realize that. I mean, we're getting into it because there's at least a potential constitutional problem here.\n And let me make another  \n As you respond to Justice Breyer's question, would you go the step further and say, Why isn't one possible solution to this difficulty we're having about government speech a requirement that if you want to justify it as government speech, you put in the advertisement, \"This is the government's position, paid for by the beef producers\"?\n The government isn't hiding from  \n No  \n the messages in its pro-beef ads. It Justice Souter, the government could do that, but it's not hiding from this message. We think that if the Court  \n It seems to be. In fact, there was an indication in the brief that the government had taken the position that if the government came out front and said, \"Hey, we're urging you to eat more meat,\" that, in fact, it would be very unsuccessful in doing it. It seems to want to hide the ball here.\n Well, the government does do that, Justice Souter. Last year, during the height of BSE crisis, the President, from his ranch in Texas, urged Americans to eat more beef and told Americans that beef was safe. That's the same message that went out, supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture, through the Beef Board, to communicate  \n Did he  \n message.\n And who paid for that? Did these people pay for that?\n The President's message was paid through general tax dollars. The message under this program is paid through the assessment. It's the same message. The message under the Beef Board is carefully controlled and supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture. If I could make a point  \n Well, let's be honest about it. Let's be totally accurate. It's not going to say, \"The government believes this.\" The government may not believe it. What it says is, \"This message is brought to you by the Beef Association under the under a program requiring contributions to advertising of the Department of Agriculture.\"\n And  \n Nobody will even know what that means, but it has the [Laughter.]\n it has  \n Well, that's good.\n it has the virtue of being totally accurate.\n That's right. Every single ad that we're aware of, has the beef check, which is the sign that the beef or the reasonable observer would know that this is a statute passed by Congress containing a message that Americans should eat more beef, that beef is nutritious, that's disseminated under a program that's carefully supervised and controlled by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n The important thing is, you have no objection to doing that.\n We would not, but we also think and if the Court made that clear in this case, it wouldn't be a basis for invalidating the statute; it might be a basis for sending it back or an as-applied challenge. Importantly, we  \n But what it what it would what it would be a basis for, at least within the confines of this argument, would be a basis for your government speech claim in the sense that you wouldn't be basing a government speech claim on what is really a misrepresentation.\n It we don't think it's a misrepresentation. The speech is funded by America's beef producers. The Respondents in this case, the centerpiece of their First Amendment argument  \n No, including those who don't want to fund it and who don't agree with the message. I mean, the problem here is that by making that representation, you indicate that this is the message of the people who are paying for it. And some of the people who are paying for it do not wish to convey that message.\n We  \n That's the misrepresentation.\n With respect, we would disagree. There's no reason to believe that a reasonable observer would think that just because an ad says it's funded by the nation's beef producers, every single one of the 850,000 individual cattle producers in this country agrees with every single statement  \n But what they would  \n of the message.\n what they would, I think, assume is that, in the name, the beef producers do, in fact, agree with this, and this is their message. What they would not assume from it is that it is what you and Mr. Kneedler are claiming, the speech of the Government of the United States. They certainly wouldn't infer that.\n We think it's fair to assume, as the Court would under the establishment clause, that they're familiar with the act of Congress that makes it its message as well as a program. A critical point on this attribution argument is that it's not supported by any single piece of evidence that Respondents, themselves, have put into the record in this case. Their First Amendment objection is to the content of the ads. There's not a single piece of evidence in the record purporting to make this attribution argument that the public would attribute to the ads to them. It's not in the complaint in this case, it's not in their own affidavits, it's not in the  \n Well, maybe  \n in the  \n maybe it's not because they didn't know you were going to be defending on the basis of government speech. That's what's getting us into this.\n Well, I highly doubt that, Justice Souter, because the First Amendment claim was added in response to the United Foods case, and this case was developed, from the outset, on a government speech theory.\n Which wasn't a government speech case.\n But it the case was tried under the First Amendment, under a government speech argument. But so the fact that Respondents didn't put  \n This case, not United Foods. Because United Foods, the Court said it it was not legitimately before us.\n That's correct. But my point is that the First Amendment case proceeded after United Foods. The government's central argument in the trial was government speech. The one time attribution came up and this is at pages 46 and 47 of the trial record Respondents' own witness testified that the public was not likely to attribute the message of the pro-beef ad to its organization of beef producers. So if the Court finds that attribution is a constitutional concern, it's no basis to bring down the act of Congress on the record in this case. The I want to emphasize, if I could, that the program in this case has been effective. The record establishes that the beef checkoff has had a statistically significant impact on increasing consumer demand for beef and an increase in prices. That's contained in the expert testimony of Professor Ward, at pages 100 and 173. The record also shows that for every checkoff dollar spent on the program, there's more than a 5.67 rate of return back to the beef producers in the form of increased prices for cattle. The Beef Board's 2003 report suggests finds that the price of a fed steer increased by more than $200 in the past few years. This program has worked. Thank you very much.\n Thank you. Mr. Tribe.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As I was listening to some of the questions about whether it would solve the problem to be more candid and say, \"This is your government speaking,\" I thought I would begin with that question, rather than with an overview of government speech. You'll recall Wooley v. Maynard, of course, in which the State of New Hampshire, without sensing the irony of its position, said, \"We'll put you in jail if you do not say, 'Live Free or Die' on\"  \n But that was  \n \"your license plates.\"\n that was an individual attribution. You, yourself, had  \n Yes.\n had to carry this message. Now, here you want us to think of some cowboy  \n Well  \n going into the bar, and he gets jeered by all his friends because he likes beef.\n Well, Justice Kennedy, my [Laughter.]\n my point my point was going to be that a footnote on the license plate saying, \"This is New Hampshire speaking,\" would not have helped. But one of the central holdings, as I understood it, of United Foods, independent of government speech, was that although there is a difference between having to say something yourself, having to put it on your car, and having to pay for it, that difference does not go to the existence of a First Amendment speech objection not an association objection, but a speech objection.\n Let's first address the question you said you said you were going to address, whether in order to be government speech, within the meaning of our cases, it has to be identified as such. Is that really true? I mean, you know, in World War II, Bob Hope would appear in movie theaters and say, you know, \"Buy war bonds?\"\n Yes, I don't  \n \"This is Bob Hope. You people ought to go out now\"  \n Justice Scalia, I think, although it's an interesting digression about whether the government is being candid, the objection here has nothing to do with that.\n Okay, so it is  \n But being the government  \n it is not essential  \n It may be.\n that government might in order to be government speech, the government does not have to identify itself as the speaker.\n I  \n Yes or no? Yes or no?\n I think the answer is yes, it must identify itself, but it doesn't help, because  \n Well, it doesn't  \n the government  \n we understand that you have a First Amendment claim, which you're going to have even if we say, \"This is not government speech.\" I think the whole point here is to decide whether this is even  \n No, no, Justice  \n an issue that should be disposed of on any grounds other than candor.\n Justice Souter, I think that we're getting off track by assuming that it helps for it to be government speech. My point is that a central theme of this  \n Well, just indulge us. I mean, some of us think it makes  \n Let me  \n a difference  \n Well, but  \n and I would  \n but let me ask you whether  \n I would like to know whether it is essential to its character as government speech that the government's say, \"This your government speaking.\"\n It depends on the purpose for which you are acting whether it's government speech. In Rust v. Sullivan, even though I think you're certainly right, Justice Scalia, that in that opinion it wasn't called government speech, in order to rationalize it, in Rosenberger and Velazquez, it was so described. But the question there wasn't, \"Can people be made to support it?\" The question, rather, was, \"Can the government insist on staying within the terms of its grants and saying you can't talk about abortion?\" When the question is, \"Can the government force you to support it,\" the \"it,\" if it's government speech, doesn't help. The First Amendment makes it a harder case for them, not easier.\n It does it all the time in general taxes. Every  \n Well  \n time we pay general taxes, we're supporting government speech  \n Of course.\n we may not agree with.\n But the Court has said there is a fundamental difference between being singled out, as in Wooley, to have a license plate, as in Pruneyard, to have someone on your premises. In Pruneyard, the Court said that one of the reasons it's okay to require someone to allow a private speaker onto the premises is that he was not required to support a government slogan. When it is  \n Yes, but there it  \n government speech  \n there it is your car, your property. That's not this. This is a generic ad on behalf of beef.\n That was true of  \n I think there is  \n that was true of United Foods.\n there's a world of difference between this and having something put on your license plate or in your  \n Justice O'Connor, I would be much more offended by having to put it in my license plate. But if I were raising cattle, and I were told, as they were told in this case, \"cattle equals beef; that's all it's worth, and that's why we won't let you, in these ads we won't let the ads, that you have to pay for, increase the demands for cattle; only beef\"  \n Well, I don't even understand your argument. Would you still be if the  \n I haven't made it.\n Well, you're trying. [Laughter.]\n Would you still be here if there were distinctions made on behalf of free-range beef or, you know, \"Our cattle\"  \n Oh, yes.\n \"never had a\"  \n The most important distinction  \n \"medicine\" or something like that? Would you still be here if those distinctions  \n Well, if it  \n had been made?\n wasn't generic there's no way for them to have an ad for every imaginable different kind of cattle in one set of advertisements. I just think  \n Well, I'm just  \n it's a  \n asking you if, theoretically, some attention had been paid to the different kinds of producers  \n Right.\n would you still be objecting?\n We would object, fundamentally, if they did not emphasize American beef. That was our first objection. They said that they don't want to emphasize American beef, because, in cross-examination, the officer of the Beef Board said, \"Consumers might actually have a preference for American beef. That would be irrational. We don't want that.\" And so all of those cattle ranchers can say that, \"We're proud of it being American.\" They can't get that in there. And the other principal thing is that they don't think of themselves as selling sides of beef. Some of them are selling dairy cattle, some of them are selling even if it's going to, in the end, be in the slaughterhouse we all die someday their fundamental belief is that these are animals, and they're to be cared for. And the reason that that makes a difference the reason that it makes a difference that they can't even advertise try to make live cattle more attractive to buy is that the collective-action problem, if that were relevant here I think that was really resolved by United Foods but the collective-action problem is really created, not solved, by what they're doing. Because the structure of the market is that there are a few concentrated meat-packers. Something like four slaughter 80 percent of the of the cattle in the United States. They have the bargaining power. And in the record, their support for the findings of the District Court, that when the demand for beef goes up through these generic ads saying, \"Eat beef\" although they certainly don't say, \"Your government says you should eat beef, beef, beef\" but when the demand for beef goes up, the profit is pocketed by the meat processor, the meat packer, the restaurant, the supermarket. And these guys still end up taking their cattle to market, and often having to pay a dollar checkoff, even though they can't even get the price of the of the cattle back. So  \n But would it  \n the free rides are now taken by the people who don't pay  \n seems to  \n the processors don't pay anything.\n I understand that a person could have an ideological objection to the content of the ad. But the ad, itself, is an effort by government, in this area, to regulate a commercial matter, not a license plate that says, \"Free Speech, or Die,\" or \"Freedom\"  \n But it regulates speech, Justice Breyer.\n Yes, I know. Right now I'm asking  \n They don't  \n Well, my question is, does it make a difference for the point of distinguishing, or not distinguishing, \"Live Free, or Die,\" and similar ideological matters does it make a difference that the fundamental aim of the program, and 99 percent of the way it's carried out, has to do with simple advertising, commercial advertising, the regulation of a commercial matter, commerce  \n Right.\n does that make a difference?\n I think it makes an emotional difference.\n But no legal difference.\n Not in the context of forcing people to pay.\n So, in other words  \n It makes a difference  \n in other words, a program that is a regulatory program regulating commerce, we should no longer think of that, though we tend to think of it as quite different in the way we approach the First Amendment we no longer, in your view, should?\n No, no. I think, certainly if we are regulating economic transactions and only dealing with speech in a purely ancillary way that is, we're regulating sale, transactions  \n We regulate advertising. We regulate commercial advertising.\n Right, but the  \n The Federal Trade Commission  \n network  \n Yes.\n didn't you say that just the fact that you call it commercial speech only means that when you are regulating problems of a transactional kind deception, overbearing then the fact that it's commercial speech makes a big difference. But you can't just generically say that because something doesn't fit your idea of what's ideological I mean, to these ranchers, the ideology  \n I didn't say  \n is different  \n I didn't say they had a  \n But whose  \n commercial objection.\n whose line whose line between ideology and commerce will  \n I am asking. In analyzing the program, there are some things for it, and there are some things against it. And in trying to make that weighing, I do think it's different, because the basis of the program is commercial regulation. And so I want to be certain, in your view, that's either correct or incorrect.\n I think it's  \n If it's incorrect, I want to know why.\n Well, I think it's if one were just weighing and didn't have a structured set of principles on the balance in favor of it, I think, you're right, we can't they're not trying to induce ideological conformity. This is not a case where they're trying to enforce what Justice Jackson calls \"the unanimity of the graveyard.\" It is a case where the spirit of the government is in the right place. The government is trying to facilitate collective speech when  \n Well, if it makes a difference, then the lens that I look at this through is called our whatever the second-tier commercial speech lends.\n I don't think  \n Have you looked at  \n That doesn't follow. I don't think that follows. It follows that if you were if you were writing on a clean slate and were trying to create a wholly new doctrine, one of the things you would look at, I suppose, is that this is not a program designed to create ideological conformity in America. At least the spirit of the program is not that. But the road to hell is often paved with good intentions, and the means, in this case, that was chosen, was not to have the government spend some more money telling people, \"Beef isn't all as bad for you as you think.\" The remedy that they are choosing is to pick a group of ranchers and say to them, \"You are the ones who are going to pay, and you are going to pay for\"  \n Mr. Tribe, would  \n \"ads that are in your name.\"\n would you comment on the argument that what will this do to compelling cigarette manufacturers to finance the advertisements against smoking?\n Well, by \"advertisements against smoking,\" Justice Stevens, if you mean, \"Here are the things that will kill you in cigarettes,\" the kind of thing that's on the package now, it seems to me that it is constitutional, under even cases like Zauderer, to say that whoever sells a product or a service  \n They have to give warning. But why is the why is the cigarette analogy different from this case? What is your answer to that?\n Well, it seems to me that no one suggests that the cigarette companies are supporting the ads in California. California is doing exactly what the Surgeon General does.\n Well, it's odd that you can be compelled to  \n Say negative things  \n engage in speech that you don't agree with. Now you're saying that the more  \n Right.\n disagreeable it is to you  \n Well  \n the more legitimate it is. That's  \n I think if you're  \n a very strange argument.\n Well, it may be strange, but I think that there have been stranger things. The reason that it's true is that if you go around doing things that might endanger people, it's entirely justifiable for the state, as part of its non-speech effort to protect people  \n Well, do you  \n from harm, to make you give warnings  \n do you accept the fact that the government can charge taxes on the sale of cigarettes and compel and use that money to tell people that they're dangerous?\n Well, I think that's a much harder case than this, to be honest with you. I think  \n We do, however.\n Well, California does that.\n Is that part of what's going on?\n In California, it does.\n So what you're arguing here  \n Yes.\n is going to have rather a drastic effect on  \n Well, I think the  \n what's going on.\n drastic effect would be the other way, wouldn't it? If this Court were to hold, despite United Foods, that it is permissible to force people to support speech they don't agree with, as long as that speech doesn't fit our sense of what's ideological, that cuts to roll back Keller and Lehnert and Abood. It's not a small part of the constitutional landscape that would be unearthed. Whereas, think about what is the marginal effect of saying  \n Wait, I don't I had not understood you to be arguing, Professor Tribe, that this would be unlawful, even if the money were raised in the fashion that it is, just from the just from the cattlemen. And the government's own program used that money to say, \"Your government thinks it's wants you to know that beef is thoroughly safe. We've done studies. Beef is good for you. You should eat more beef.\" I thought you  \n No, I do think that would be permissible.\n That would be permissible?\n Because, I mean, technically, it would solve only the association problem. They're not associated with the message. They're still forced to support it, but not in any sense different from general taxpayers. And because that's the case, and because it would be an odd formalism to say that it makes a difference whether we segregate that money or not, seems to me it would follow that if the government is willing to pay the political cost of having the speech be perhaps less persuasive because of people's discount for what the government says and of having to get an appropriation from the taxpayers I mean, taxpayers are smart enough to know  \n No, not that. The same program, but you just have a little tag on the ad.\n Like the lockbox? I mean, every I think the taxpayers know that money is fungible. Well, in this case, you mean if you had the program, not from general revenue, but you simply said, on the ad, \"This is actually part of a government program\"? I don't think that solves any problem, other than deception.\n What's the  \n Deception is the my constitutional argument.\n what's the difference between the checkoff and the excise tax?\n Well, the checkoff in this case is money that goes to a group, which, though it is organized by the government, purports to represent  \n So the answer is  \n the way it structured  \n where  \n these people.\n where the money goes and who pays out the money for the ad, that's the difference.\n Well, the difference is the whole structure. Keep in mind  \n Well, isn't that the isn't that the essential difference between the structure in this case and the structure in the case in which the government comes out, saying, \"This is your government, saying, 'Don't smoke.'\"\n Yes, one the difference is that in one case, we've got Congress, we've got the executive, we have one  \n Right.\n person, one vote. Here, we have a million  \n I know, but take all that out of it take all that out of it, and what is your answer to Justice Stevens and Justice Souter? That is, look, like this, you have an organization, the Federal Trade Commission, say, or that the FDA says, on the one hand, (a) broccoli industry, \"Fruits and vegetables are good for you; crib death device, \"Buy anti-crib-death devices; \"Buy car seats for your children\"; or, \"Don't smoke\"; or  \n Well, I mean  \n \"Don't buy a crib without a crib-death device\"  \n I mean, I think it's  \n \"or a car without a car seat.\"\n Right.\n See? One's negative and one's positive. And everything else is the same. Then how do you  \n Whether it's  \n what's the difference?\n negative  \n Yes.\n or positive, it's the government  \n Okay, maybe it doesn't matter.\n Well, no, it matters, in this sense. When the government puts out a message and puts its credibility behind the message, likely to have to balance it's going to say, \"A little broccoli, but a little steak.\" \"Don't risk crib death\"  \n But I'm not interested I got that point.\n Right.\n I'm not dismissing it. I understand it.\n All right.\n But I'm not sure  \n So I'm not understanding what your question is.\n Well, my question is, is it implied in what you're argued that it would be equally unconstitutional, in the same way, to tell the cigarette industry to advertise, \"Don't smoke,\" or to tell the automobile industry to advertise, \"Buy car seats for your children,\" or to tell the crib industry to advertise, \"Be sure you have an anti-crib-death device\"?\n I think  \n And all that, assuming the financing is the same as here, everything else the same, is it implicit in your argument that they're all equally unlawful?\n No. My argument is that you can require the seller of any commodity to include warnings. It does not necessarily follow that you can say to an industry, \"You're bad guys. We want you to put on an advertising campaign, and the campaign has to have these characteristics.\" Forcing them to advocate that people not buy their products, I think, is not the same thing  \n Mr. Tribe  \n as forcing them to say  \n I thought  \n that it will be addictive or that it will cause cancer.\n But you're saying  \n I thought  \n I want to be sure I that I understood your answer. You can compel them to make warnings. Can you compel them to pay for warnings that are just industry-specific, in saying, \"This is dangerous\"  \n I think so, because I can't see any difference between saying that you put on the package, \"The Surgeon General has determined that smoking will cause cancer,\" and saying, \"We're going to put on television\"  \n But it seems  \n \"the Surgeon General\"  \n almost ironic, to me, to say that you have a greater power to tell the whole industry to publish something they don't want to publish than you do to let them  \n But that Justice Stevens, what  \n pay for what  \n what is  \n 90 percent of them want to say.\n what is the difference between telling them that I mean, there may be a critical difference between the point of sale and a generic ad that is, the power to regulate the transaction to make sure it's safe, includes the power to include on the package certain warnings. The moment you step back from that and say that, \"Because you're in a dangerous business, you have to publish general warnings to the public,\" maybe that's where the line has to be drawn, because I agree that it would be rather bizarre  \n Are you limiting your point to putting information on the package, or are you saying they could could California compel a cigarette companies to contribute to a large fund which is just used to by newspaper advertising describing the dangers of smoking? Could they do that?\n Well, I think that the rationale for that would be far stronger than this. The state's power to protect people, in terms of life and health, includes the power to compel  \n Yes, but supposing there are disagreements. We were you were talking about cigarettes. But supposing there's a legitimate disagreement between the industry position and the government position  \n Okay.\n could the government, nevertheless, insist on the industry financing advertising advocating the government's position?\n Well, not advocating; reporting what the government position is. I mean, the when the cigarette company says on the package, \"The Surgeon General has found this stuff is deadly,\" they're not quite saying, \"We agree with the Surgeon General.\" They've making them fund or support statements that do not reflect their own beliefs, as though it were  \n So, in this case  \n is impermissible.\n I take it, it would be okay if the beef producers had to use a dollar a head to put, \"Eating too much beef is dangerous to your health.\"\n Well, if they had well, they're not beef producers. I mean, I am troubled by they're these are cattle.\n All right, cattle, then  \n All right? And then and then they're trying, ultimately, to brand us as though we are slicing these things up and selling them.\n But what's the answer to my question?\n If the question is, can retail grocers be required to put on the beef packages they sell, \"The government has determined that the cholesterol content is dangerous if you have more than X,\" I see no reason why that would be harder  \n In other words  \n to defend than the cigarette package.\n I think the question, or at least the version I have of it  \n Yes.\n is, we have this case, exactly, and the only difference is, instead of getting these people to eat say, \"Eat beef,\" what they say do is, they get people together and say, \"Don't eat too much beef.\" I put  \n Well  \n \"too much,\" because that  \n Yes.\n makes it more realistic. All right, now, does it suddenly become constitutional?\n The program is facially unconstitutional. It is the structure that says to all these people, \"You've got to put money into this elaborate structure, which purports to represent you\" that is, the they have all this stuff saying that the Beef Board is related to the industry as board of directors, the shareholders \"These people, who purport to represent you, will, under the aegis of the government, put out statements at various times.\" That's facially unconstitutional.\n All right. Consider this theory. The Congress passes an excise tax. It happens to be a dollar head, on the cattle, just like this so-called \"checkoff.\" And the government uses the excise tax revenue to finance advertising, saying maybe saying, \"Eat more beef,\" maybe advertising, saying, \"Don't eat quite so much.\"\n Or maybe  \n First Amendment problem  \n talking about the war in Iraq. No, I think that once your taxes enter the general fund, a pretense that it's  \n Including excise?\n Well, I don't think excise taxes are segregated in any way that makes that makes it harder  \n No, I just want to know what  \n than Social Security.\n your position is. I just want to know what your position is.\n My position is that once the revenue is part of the government's general fund, the government's subject to doctrines that I don't think are First Amendment doctrines about government propaganda there may be limits on the government's ability  \n Okay, then  \n to defend it.\n He's just going back to  \n Subject to that  \n Okay, then it does not have  \n it's not a First Amendment problem.\n it's not a First Amendment problem. It does not have the objection that you're raising.\n That's correct.\n Okay.\n Is that is that an answer to the question that Justice Kennedy urged in the opening argument? That is, it's the same dollar a head, except you call it an excise tax instead of a whatever this is called. The same thing, but to say it's a tax. And you're not this is not general revenues that you collect from everybody and spend  \n If the structure is they take the money from you and put it in this elaborate machinery which comes out with statements you're forced to support, the statements that don't have behind them the accountability checks of the Federal Government, which has to answer to taxpayers and answer to the public for the stuff it puts out that is if that's what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it, it remains unconstitutional. It remains unconstitutional because these individuals are forced in a way that taxpayers are not forced to be part of a system in which, even if you have footnotes saying, \"This is pursuant to the government,\" a system in which they will be generally understood in just the way Justice Breyer said, \"Well, you know, we assume\"  \n But suppose  \n that these people  \n we don't have that? I mean, could then could the government fix this problem this way, saying, \"We're going to get the same bucks, but we are going and we're going to have the same kinds of ads, but they're going to be labeled, 'U.S. Department of Agriculture.\"\n And we're going to eliminate the cattlemen's Beef Board and all of these things  \n Yes.\n that are supposed to represent you  \n But we are but where this money is coming from to pay this is  \n I would be happy to represent the cattlemen in that circumstance, saying, \"You still have not an associational right, but a right not to be singled out to support government speech.\" But it would be a different and more difficult claim. One. Two, this Court doesn't have before it the possibility of rewriting all of this. Three, there was a severability provision in an earlier version of the law suggesting that maybe if you could lop something off, it would be okay. But that was eliminated in the current law. And, finally, any attempts to analogize this to the cases like Lehnert and Keller, in terms of remedy, that maybe we can create some scheme where only the objectionable part is returned, is fundamentally incoherent, because what is objectionable here is homogenizing all of these people into some one message, and putting it out through this elaborate structure that purports to represent them.\n May I go back to one of your reasons, which was that they are being singled out to pay for this? They're being singled out to pay for it in the excise tax situation. Do you come to different answers, depending whether it's excise tax or singled out without excise tax, based, essentially, on the ground that there is a point beyond which we simply cannot look behind the expenditure of tax revenue? Is that it?\n I think that there's a point beyond which, for institutional reasons, it would be very problematic for a courts to say that you could trace the dollars into the treasury and those institutional reasons would be, I think, an instance of under-enforcement of a constitutional norm, because the underlying constitutional principle that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick, to get some people to support speech they don't believe in, that would be there. But the difficulty of having this Court enforce that principle, I think, would be very real. But no such difficulty, I think, is presented in a case like this one, because if this case came out their way because of government speech, of course, United Foods would be obliterated, but a good deal more would be obliterated, because the theory would have to be that because it's not on your license plate, because you don't have to carry it, you're only supporting it, then that's all the difference in the world. Because, otherwise, its being government speech would make it worse. But if it's all the difference in the world whether you have to carry or utter it, or merely support it, then all of the decisions of this Court carefully protecting the rights of dissenters in every imaginable kind of organization, from the powerful overriding theory that collective-action problems mean that we've really got to get more speech over here than you are willing, yourselves, to engage in  \n Yes, but on the other hand  \n you'd be  \n you're running into the problem that the taxpayer can be compelled to pay taxes to support activities that he doesn't support at all. That's the other  \n Well, we do that all the time.\n the other extreme. I know we  \n We do that all  \n do it all the time.\n the time.\n And when are we crossing  \n That's the  \n the line?\n that's why we have elections, in part.\n Pardon me?\n Right? We have elections, in part, because the only way there's no way to protect every individual's right to have the government's collective policy suit his or her fancy. I mean, that way  \n But it is  \n would allow complete chaos.\n inconsistent with the basic principle on which you rely, that the individual should not be compelled to support speech  \n Well  \n with which he disagrees.\n to support supporting speech is somewhat different from supporting activities that you don't agree with. I mean, the First Amendment makes a fundamental difference in that respect.\n But isn't  \n If there were  \n isn't that  \n I'm sorry.\n Don't you go back to the answer you gave me? Sure, when taxes are involved, there may be an under-inclusive enforcement of certain individual rights, but they have to be under-enforced, because, otherwise, you simply cannot administer a tax structure.\n Or any structure. I mean, Bowen v. Roy I mean, there's a sympathetic case of the man who did not want Little Bird of the Snow to be given a Social Security number. But we could, when we, interactive with the government, say to him, \"You we can't make you give the number to get the food for your little daughter,\" but if one person says, \"I don't want numbers in your computers,\" and the other says, \"I don't want letters, I want only numbers,\" the fact that every individual who has a potential claim on a collective choice could pull in a different direction means we can't run a system that way. But no such problem is presented in cases like this.\n Thank you, Mr. Tribe.\n Thank you.\n I think we understand your position. Thank you. Mr. Kneedler, you have about three three or four minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. Mr. Tribe has conceded that if this program were financed by a system of excise taxes that went into the general Treasury, and Congress then paid provided the exact same amount of money to produce the exact same ads, that there would be no constitutional problem. And, in our view, the First Amendment simply does not regulate the details of government fundraising, the details of government accounting, and the details of government bookkeeping in that manner. The First Amendment is  \n But that goes back to Frothingham and Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon, and United States versus Butler, where we could trace the amount.\n Right, and  \n It's old stuff.\n Right, and the Court the Court superceded those decisions in cases like Carmichael Coal and Storaasli Company and cases like that, where the Court said excise taxes can be imposed. As long as there is a public welfare justification, they can be spent. And it would be an odd result to have the First Amendment drive the way the government arranges a system like this. After all and Professor Tribe said it would be different if the cattlemen's Beef Board were gotten rid of. It actually the principal point here is the Secretary controls the speech. Whatever the cattlemen's Beef Board does and that is a government entity the Secretary controls the speech. So that this is not some jury-rigged system; this is a system of governmental control. Congress has prescribed the message, and the Secretary carries it out. It's important to recall that many federal excise taxes go into dedicated trust funds for highways, for other functions like that. And out of that dedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on highway safety. So the fact that it's dedicated really should not matter. And this case is completely different from cases like Keller. In Keller, the state bar was not appointed by the by the government, there was no governmental supervision of what it did, and the government certainly did not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes, et cetera. This is different in all the critical ways that make this a program of government speech. And, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to strike down this program would have drastic consequences. There are many, many agricultural promotion programs like this. There are 13 at the national level. This program has been in existence since 1988. One billion dollars has been collected, and promotions have been conducted under it. These promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even and even earlier. And there are many programs on the state levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in this case shows. This Court would be striking down a lot to hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is unconstitutional. It's also important to recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer. Yes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer. And the very first finding that Congress made in the Beef Act is, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet. When the when the because of the collective-action problem in this industry, that it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message is not getting to consumers. So this the justifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in terms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the ultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which is to correctly market failure with respect to advertising in order to get information to consumers.\n Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a challenge to Michigan's $100 per truck flat annual fee that is imposed on all trucks that are registered to do point-to-point operations in the State of Michigan. We submit that this fee, this flat per truck fee, has the same impermissible effects on interstate commerce as the two flat truck fees that were struck down by this Court in American Trucking Associations v. Scheiner. In the American Trucking Associations v. Scheiner case, this Court looked at the practical effect of these fees and found that because of their unapportioned structure, that the fees had four interrelated types of impermissible effects on interstate commerce. First, the Court found that these kinds of flat fees were a financial barrier against out-of-state motor carriers even coming into the State that imposed the the fee. There's no question in this case that the Michigan flat fee has the same kind of protectionist quality.\n Well, it it does for trucks that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan. It doesn't for anybody else.\n Yes, it it discriminates and it it has an exclusory effect on trucks out-of-state carriers that want to compete in the and bring their trucks across the the border of Michigan and compete against local carriers for intrastate hauls.\n It would have that it certainly has that tendency. Do we have do we know in fact what the effect is? Is it deterring anybody? How many trucks does it affect?\n There was not a trial below. So we don't have that fact. We believe that as in the Scheiner case, these these tendencies are inherent there. Because of the structure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has what this Court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and that is to for carriers, once they have paid this fee as an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate commerce and to concentrate them into in the State of Michigan in the local activities. And that in fact, the State acknowledges that. Below, the State said that motor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to the State of Michigan in order to avoid these consequences. And even the Michigan Court of Appeals recognized that, saying a local carrier would be discouraged from operating in interstate commerce.\n Of course, it also I mean, you say it it favors the in-state intrastate carrier because if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage, you you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas the interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of-state, doesn't do that. On the other hand, you can certainly argue that that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers in in another respect, that is to say, interstate carriers who who do nothing within the State do not pay it, whereas the the Michigan carrier that does a lot of interstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate business interstate business, he still pays it. Isn't that right?\n Well, Your Honor, I think what what that's saying and I know that was the argument made in the Solicitor General's brief is that you can discriminate against one component of interstate commerce, those carriers that want to actually compete and do intrastate business in the State, as long as you give a benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those who just wish to operate in the in the State of Michigan in interstate commerce.\n Well, it's not so much that you necessarily can do it, but it it sort of interrupts the the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown back on a on on a practical effects analysis under Pike.\n No, Your Honor. I think what happens is that that there are the segment of carriers that would like to compete against intrastate carriers. The fact that other carriers may be getting a break in terms of regulatory fees and we don't know that to be the truth, getting the other interstate carriers. It's the Boston Stock Exchange, and I think it was said again in the Scheiner case that that you can't discriminate among interstate carriers. And as we pointed out in our brief, you could set up a situation in which a a State discriminated in favor of interstate carriers in situations or industries where their locals had no interest in competing, but where their their locals were interested in competing, they could set up a discriminatory system. So you can protect timber industry in in Oregon and  \n But may I ask this question? Suppose you have an interstate carrier that does 100,000 miles of business in Michigan and you have an intrastate carrier that does a 100,000 miles of business in Michigan. They both say the pay the same tax, don't they?\n If they each do 100,000 miles of intrastate business in Michigan  \n Yes.\n they would pay the same flat fee.\n They would both pay the same tax, both the intra and the interstate. Now, that doesn't sound to me like discrimination against either one.\n If if this if this tax was apportioned based on mileage, it would not be discrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and  \n No, but I'm just saying if the intrastate and interstate carriers both have the same intrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax.\n And we we would and again, if this was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be it would be fine. But the fact is as in Scheiner, the out-of-state carriers, because the interstate carrier is is operating  \n Yes, but you might have an intrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage, only 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays does 100,000 miles. They both pay the same tax too. And everybody is treated alike on their intrastate business.\n That would be true but that  \n And the tax only operates on intrastate business.\n The factual situation is going to be that the interstate carrier is just not going to have the opportunity to do as much business in Michigan as the intrastate carrier.\n Well, it seems to me you should have introduced some evidence on that point. I mean, it it really is an assumption of your unfairness argument that purely intrastate carriers do significantly more intrastate business than interstate carriers who choose to do some interstate business. Now, does that strike you as self-evident? It does not need any  \n Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\n demonstration?\n It does strike me as self-evident. In fact, to courts below we have we've made this argument. We've seen this argument now. The cases have called it intuitively obvious. And from the discussion of in the Scheiner case and from the discussion in the Nippert case, the very difference between interstate and intrastate commerce means that on average the interstate carrier is just not going to use the State's facilities as much as the in-state carrier.\n Wouldn't we be better able to decide this question after a trial rather than speculation on both sides?\n I don't think a trial is necessary because, as I say, this this Court quoted Justice Frankfurter clearly, and I think the Solicitor General in his brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is not going to get as much benefit from this fee. This is a variable cost fee. In effect, the out-of-state carrier is having to pay more than its fair share of the cost of the of the State's regulatory system. And again, that's something that was accepted in the Scheiner case, accepted in in the Nippert case. And the intrastate carrier every time that it operates in the State, it is using that privilege.\n Well, Nippert was over 100 years ago, wasn't it?\n I think the Nippert case was from the 1940's I believe. In any event, as we've been discussing  \n It seems like 100 years ago. (Laughter.)\n It's  \n Mr. Digges, this the the there was a question about the ramifications of the position that you're presenting. That is, there are many situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount, although some people who are licensed will be doing business in other States and have to get licenses there as well. The example that was featured in the in the briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed, say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any break on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also admitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his practice out-of-state, out of the District.\n Yes, Your Honor. I know that that example was given. I think there are a variety of flat fees that would be unaffected by this. There are fees that would be administrative charges and and if all the State is doing is charging, for example, the cost of a background investigation or the cost of a truck inspection, a fixed cost, then it's fair to ask the carrier to pay a fixed fee or to ask the taxpayer to pay a fixed fee. With respect to the bar fees, they are obviously different than the trucking industry and and the taxation of an instrumentality in interstate commerce. But we think that there may be impracticalities in apportioning a bar fee. You could have an attorney in his office in Virginia that is working for a California customer or California client that is being for a case that is being tried in the court system of Oregon, and then for transaction work, he could be working for a customer or a client in in Missouri for a multi-state. So it may be difficult to apportion fees. We haven't really examined that. But we know from this Court's decisions that that is easy and can be apportioned for truck fees, and truck fees this Court said in Scheiner that the technology is now available to look at the extent of the activity and the taxpayer in in of the truck in the State, and later on in a subsequent decision said that you can easily track large physical objects over States. So you can apportion these fees on trucks to their mileage in the State, to their loads, to the gross revenue associated with the  \n The Scheiner case didn't make a distinction based on in-state activity. I thought that that that flat fee was applicable to every motor carrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.\n That is accurate, Your Honor, but but nominally Scheiner for instance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scheiner case did say that did uphold the fee because they said only Pennsylvania could charge for the privilege of using Pennsylvania's highways. So like a lot of like all interstate commerce, you can always as as the Court said in Nippert, you can always find carve out a local activity to say that this is going to be the focus of the tax. I think a problem here is with the the approach taken by the State and the Solicitor General is they suggest that you go back to the days in which you're trying to draw a line between interstate and intrastate activity, this time not because the intrastate activity is going to be immune from the tax, but this time because you're going to have some separate, different kind of test applicable to something that clearly is subject to Commerce Clause protections, but is is, in their view, subject to a more lenient Commerce Clause protection. And I don't think this Court wants to retreat back to the days of having to draw a line between interstate and intrastate commerce and and then having separate tests. If there are no more questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.\n Very well, Mr. Digges. Mr. Hanson.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In contrast to the ATA case, the question before the Court today in the Mid-Con case is whether the fee on vehicles operating solely in interstate commerce is preempted by 49 U.S.C., section 14504.\n It's the same fee we're talking about.\n It is  \n But a different theory of invalidity.\n It is not the same fee. The the fee under subsection (1) that ATA is arguing about is an intrastate fee charged only to  \n Intrastate.\n carriers that engage in intrastate activities.\n Okay, and yours is the interstate fee.\n The subsection (2) fee under 478.1  \n And your fee applies to all Michigan-plated vehicles. Am I correct about that?\n That are operating solely in interstate commerce.\n Yes.\n Do do I understand that the two distinctions in what is done with the or the way the fee is collected and what's done with it is that the the fee is charged against the is it the operator as opposed to the owner, if there is a distinction? Is is that correct?\n All of the fees under subsections (1) and (2) are charged against the motor carrier  \n The carrier.\n or  \n That's the term I should use.\n motor carrier, not to the owner.\n Which may not be the owner. And number two, as I understand it, as distinct from the registration fee, this fee goes to a different State department. Is that right?\n That's correct.\n Now, let that's that's a premise for a question I want to ask you, and the question is in economic effect, is there any difference really between charging this $100 fee with those differences from the registration fee and simply jacking up the registration fee by $100? Would there would there be any economic difference to the to the public or or indeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the the registration fee by $100? Because the the registration fee is passed on to the carrier, if it's not the owner, and the carrier it doesn't make any difference to the carrier whether the whether the State diverts the $100 up front or or divides the the registration fee after it's paid. So is there any economic difference?\n Yes, there is and the reason why there is a difference is that the the fees that are paid for plating are under the under the International Reciprocity Plan, the registration plan, the IRP. And that is an apportioned fee. It is charged to all vehicles, all commercial motor vehicles, regardless of whether it's for-hire or private, regardless of it's in-state or of interstate. So everybody pays their apportioned amount based on mileage.\n No, but that shows that maybe I don't understand. That that tells us what happens to the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make any difference to the person who is paying the money, does it?\n Yes, it does.\n Except that he only has to pay in one place, and and if they  \n He pays  \n increase the registration fee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once.\n But he would only pay the fee based on his mileage in the State. It is not a flat fee if it is put onto the IRP fees. Those  \n Who who sets the fee for the plating?\n The the State does. It is administered by the Michigan Secretary of State  \n So  \n but I believe all of those are statutory fees.\n you could have unlike the the fee, the $10 fee, that  \n The SSRS.\n the Federal cap, this would for plating it could be anything each individual State chooses it to be?\n In terms of the plating fee?\n Yes.\n Each State is free to charge its its own amount as the plating fee.\n Sure, but it so so regardless of what Michigan does with the apportioned amounts, the amount it charges to the to the owner, in the case of the the plating fee, is is simply set by the State of Michigan.\n That is  \n Yes.\n that is correct.\n So what and and the the virtue of the apportionment is that the that the owner or the or the owner, I guess in this case, does not have to pay fees in 49 other States.\n That is correct.\n But he doesn't it doesn't matter to that's the value to him. It doesn't matter to him how they apportion whatever that fee is that Michigan charges.\n If they apportion it, however, it is it is not it does not if they put it into the IRP, it is not part of the registration process. The thing that the  \n But who I mean, is that's that's fine as a matter of administration, but in terms of the the end effect on the person who has to pay it and on the consumers to whom it is ultimately passed on, what difference does it make?\n Well, the the difference for the person who is paying it under IRP is that if only 20 percent of their interstate miles as a solely interstate operating carrier, if only 20 percent are in the State, they would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle.\n Can I ask a quick question? The there are three things. Were were you finished?\n No, I don't think he I didn't  \n Sorry.\n I don't understand your answer. If you were finished, I don't understand.\n Okay.\n If it's if it is put into a plating charge as opposed to a registration part of the registration of a carrier for the privilege or the opportunity to carry on interstate trucking activities in the State of Michigan, that is the flat fee that we're talking about. Under the SSRS we believe that $100 charge exceeds the $10 maximum and is therefore preempted. If they put it into the IRP, that IRP is charged against the owner of the vehicle, paid against the Secretary of paid to the Secretary of State. It is not a qualification under for the privilege of engaging in interstate trucking in the State of Michigan. The SSRS sets up the standards by which a carrier becomes qualified to operate in the State. Michigan exceeds those standards. If you put those fees into the IRP fees, then the carrier or then the owner of the vehicle pays only the proportionate amount based on his mileage in the State.\n May I ask this question? Supposing the Michigan changed its system and said we're going to charge you $90 for as a plating fee. We're only talking about vehicles that are plated in Michigan. We're going to charge you $90 for a plating fee and now we're going to take 10 what used to part of the $100 and another $10 registration fee. Would that be permissible?\n It would be permissible because the if the $10 is charged to the carrier as part of the registration process, in order to be qualified to engage in interstate trucking. The $90 would be charged to the owner of the vehicle and would be paid on an apportioned basis under IRP.\n Okay. What if he said $20 instead of $10?\n If he said $20 was going to be put towards the the State instead of instead of $100?\n Yes.\n And $80 towards IRP?\n Yes.\n In that case, that would still violate the the SSRS, if it is done as part of the registration process, which is what Michigan does. Michigan even though you're properly SSRS registered, Michigan still requires, under its SSRS form it directs the carrier to specifically identify vehicles by make, model, and serial number to obtain a decal by paying $100 for that fee. If they pay $20, that exceeds the $10 maximum that Congress set up in the SSRS in order to be qualified to operate in interstate trucking in the State of Michigan, as an interstate carrier in in Michigan.\n But that that assumes it's an SSRS charge, and the State denies that it it has anything to do with SSRS. Don't you have to establish that it's part of the SSRS program?\n I think what you have to do is you have to look at what the the standards do. The the registration standards in the SSRS are set up as the process by which a carrier has the privilege to enter into interstate trucking activities in Michigan. When you look at the statute  \n Okay, but what what if the State says, you can enter enter into interstate activities for nothing? We're simply going to increase the registration fee by $100. Couldn't the State do that?\n The State could do that and that would be perfectly permissible.\n So this is pure formalism.\n It is not pure form. Any what what Congress did was say that in order to qualify a carrier they were concerned about the burdens. When ISTEA was enacted in 1991, they were concerned about the burdens on carriers of individual State registration requirements. And they sought to to alleviate that by making it so that carriers could only would only have to register in one State so they could do business in all States on an interstate basis.\n Maybe they sought to but maybe they didn't succeed. As I read the statute, it it really applies to the the limitation of $10 only to those fees that are SSRS fees, and these are not. So maybe there's there's a hole in the Federal statute.\n And I don't believe that's the case, Justice Scalia.\n You're trying to make the Federal statute work sensibly, but  \n Right.\n I hate to tell you, but not all statutes work sensibly.\n Right. I think what you have to do, though, is go back and look at what Michigan does. Michigan has a a State statute, 478.7(1), that says in order to operate to carry property on an interstate basis in Michigan, you must register with the PSC and you must pay the required vehicle fees. The registration standards are what they do as in accordance with SSRS: insurance, service of process, and operating authority. Then you have to pay a fee, and the fee is limited to $10 per vehicle. In the case of Michigan, those vehicle fees are set forth in two different sections of the statutes. One is .7(4), which is the $10 SSRS fee. The other one is subsection it's 2(2). That fee is $100  \n Thank you, Mr. Hanson.\n in order for a Michigan-plated vehicle to engage in interstate commerce.\n Your time is expired.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Boynton, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner, American Trucking, began its reply brief with the claim that the central reality in this case is that the Michigan intrastate fee places significant burdens on interstate commerce. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected this claim squarely, saying that as a matter of that that was a matter of pure speculation. There's no evidence in the record before this Court that the trucking companies' route choices are affected by the intrastate fee. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that the intrastate fee keeps anyone out from engaging in intrastate trucking in Michigan.\n It sure does make sense to me, though. Surely it's the case that a company that does nothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by and large, log in many more miles intrastate than a company which does interstate business but part of its business is intrastate Michigan business. I I just it seems to me obvious that  \n Well, the Michigan Court of Appeals said that that very well may be the case, but they pointed to the fact that there were no facts to support that finding. And this is completely different than in Scheiner. In Scheiner you had a a trial, you had evidence before the court. This Court noted that the the cost to an interstate trucker in that situation was five times greater than the cost to a trucker that was in Pennsylvania. You just simply don't have those facts here. What you have is a discrete or a distinct local activity that is something that doesn't affect the interstate commerce.\n It it's the case that a company that does only intrastate Michigan business logs all of its miles on in Michigan. Right? No miles outside of Michigan.\n That's right.\n And it seems to me it's obvious that a a company that does interstate business does not log all of its miles in in Michigan, and likely likely very likely does does less miles in Michigan than than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker.\n Well, Justice Scalia, that very well may be true, but we don't have any way of of qualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't have those facts.\n Is it difficult to apportion the intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled intrastate?\n Well, Your Honor, I I think it is very difficult to do that. As the United States noted in its brief, they didn't think that mileage would be appropriate because this this fee doesn't support the maintenance of the highways. What this fee does is allows trucking companies or allows that truck to operate that truck in intrastate business. So mileage isn't appropriate. Our position is that mileage isn't appropriate because it's next to impossible to try and figure out. What do you compare it to? Do you do you compare it to interstate miles? Do you compare it to a ratio of interstate intrastate to interstate? And if you do that, how how can you come up with a accurate picture of, you know, what the value of that license is in Michigan? It may be  \n Does it make any difference how high the the fee is set? If it were $10,000 a truck, does that raise any concerns that are different?\n Well, Your Honor, the Michigan Court of Appeals had taken the position that this was a fee, not a tax, and under a fee if if a fee was $10,000, if the expenses matched the the revenue from it, well, then it it would be a could be sustained as a fee. Now, if were a tax  \n You you defend that position, that that it doesn't violate the Commerce Clause so long as it's a fee not a tax?\n Your Honor, we think that the if it's a fee and not a tax, the Michigan Court of Appeals applied the correct standard, and that was the standard of Pike v. Bruce Church. And you would look to the whether the statute regulated even-handedly, whether it affected a legitimate local  \n Whenever it's a fee, not a tax, you immediately go to Pike Church.\n I think that that that was what the Michigan Court of Appeals  \n I know. I know that's what they said.\n Yes, and I I think that's a  \n I found it very strange.\n I think that's an appropriate manner in dealing with it. But if you if you look at the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion  \n What makes it a fee instead of a tax other than the court saying so?\n Well, first of all, it provided a direct benefit to the intrastate truckers. They were able to operate in the State of Michigan. Second of all, they pointed out that it was in relation to the services granted, being able to do that, and then the third component would be the voluntariness, whether they could agree to they didn't have to engage in intrastate trucking  \n You could say the same about a tax. You could say, you know, you only have to pay this tax if you operate in Michigan. You don't want to operate; you don't have to pay it. And you could also say unless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in Michigan. Does that make it a tax or a fee?\n Well, I think in the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion, it it was a fee, and I think I think what we come back to, Your Honor, is the idea is there a specific class of individuals or businesses that are benefitted. And I think that that's the distinction between a fee and tax. Also, a tax is a general revenue-raising measure, whereas a fee is not. And that's another distinction of of a tax. And indeed, this Court in National Cable Industry v. the United States, which we cited in our brief, this Court said as whether an exaction is a tax or a fee depends on whether its purpose is to raise revenue or regulate an industry or services. One of the things  \n I'd like to get back just for a moment  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n to the answer you gave about apportionment because I wasn't quite sure I understood the answer. You said, well, apportionment is very difficult. What are you supposed to do? What are you what's the base? Well, and you said, should we apportion against between in-state and out-of-state, and I would think the answer is yes. That's the whole point.\n Well  \n And if we're talking about mileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently susceptible of apportionment. Now, it may be that administratively this is just too expensive. That may be that may be a very valid argument. But so far as saying that there's no basis for apportionment, I didn't understand your answer.\n Well, I I maybe I misspoke myself. What I really meant to say was it would be very difficult to do. And in our joint appendix in the joint appendix  \n It would be difficult to do administratively. But just because of the cost of collecting all the  \n Well, Your Honor, I think that you got to look at what's the total cost here. The cost is not only to the administrative aspect by the State, but this imposes another cost on the truckers.\n That that I agree that that is expensive. However, it seems to me that it would be easier to do it with trucks which have miles than with  \n But, Your Honor, the problem is  \n than with, say, attorneys or accountants or whatever.\n Your Honor, the problem with that is that this fee, this intrastate fee, does not go to maintain the highways as it was in Scheiner. They make the argument that it's very easy that the mechanism they, being American Trucking, makes the argument that it's very easy to just start logging up the miles and and you have the mechanism there. But the difference between Scheiner and this case is that in Scheiner you were measuring all intrastate miles, any miles traveled within that State. And there's a mechanism available administratively to do that. The IRP requires that. But here you're not logging all intrastate miles. You're only logging those miles in the State that involve a point-to-point delivery, from one intrastate point to another. So you don't you'd have to get a whole new record keeping or you'd have to keep track of a while different set of miles than you would with respect to the IRP. And that's the thing that I find striking about this, that the American Trucking Association is basically saying to its members that they want to have them do more record keeping on their part.\n But the American Trucking Association is is willing to be thrown into the into the briar bush apparently. It certainly involves no no difficulty for your Michigan intrastate truckers. All of their miles are intrastate. And the plaintiffs here say we're we're willing to you know, to provide figures showing how much of our carriage was was exclusively intrastate if you want to apportion.\n Well, that may be, Your Honor, but the the point is what we're dealing with is a a fee that has revenues of about $3 million. And if you have additional record keeping, how much of that $3 million is going to have to be devoted to paying for the administrative costs that are involved?\n May I ask this question? Is the fee payable before the a carrier may engage in business or is it after the carrier has paid? Is it is it like a tax that's paid after the year is out?\n It's paid before. They they have to have  \n If you had to pay it before, there would be no way to calculate it ahead of time because nobody would have had any mileage. Isn't that correct?\n I'm sorry.\n If you have to pay it before the year begins and before you're allowed to engage in the business, you would have no way of measuring the number of miles you're going to travel during the the ensuing year.\n That's correct. You would have to have  \n Well, I suppose that's the same thing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is there. That's paid at the beginning of the year, isn't it? And it has to be apportioned among the States. And you don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of the year.\n Now, you're talking about the interstate fee, Your Honor.\n Right, right. But I'm saying the same problem arises when you do any apportioning.\n Well, it let me back up. The reason I asked with you when you were referring to the $10 fee is because the intrastate fee we have a $10 component in that as well. You can obtain a temporary fee for $10 for 72 hours to conduct an intrastate operation. So the statute in structurally has some apportionment factor in it. So you don't have to necessarily buy the $100 intrastate fee decal to conduct intrastate operations.\n It's like a 3-day fishing license.\n I suppose that would be one way  \n How how does that work in in practice? Is it easily accessible? Suppose the company  \n Well  \n wants to fill up its truck and and it said, well, this is going to be the only haul this season for me, so I want the 3-day permit.\n Yes, Your Honor, you can obtain the permits in advance. You don't have to have trucks lined up at the border waiting to get a decal or get a permit. You can purchase them in advance. So that that's available to the truckers. The one thing I should mention, though, is you have to have one you already have to have one vehicle licensed intrastate. You already have to have paid the fee on one vehicle, and then you would be eligible to purchase additional temporary permits as the need arose based on seasonal needs or an emergency situation. So that that allows the the statute I I would submit to Your Honor, allows some apportioning in and of itself.\n This this applies only to operations that are both licensed and registered in Michigan. Is that so?\n No. Your Honor I think is referring to the interstate fee  \n Right, right, yes.\n which is a different fee, which is in the Mid-Con case. Our position  \n Are you going to address the Mid-Con question?\n I'm sorry?\n Are you going to address the Mid-Con question?\n I was going to do that right now, Your Honor. The position that the State of Michigan and the Michigan Public Service Commission has is the SSRS does not preempt the interstate fee. And the reason for that is  \n Well, what's the point of the limitation in SSRS to $10 if the State can impose any additional fee it wants just by calling it a different name?\n Well, Your Honor, I think what you have to realize is you have when you look at the text of the statute, I think what is very clear from reading the text is that the SSRS does not preempt all State fees and charges on motor carriers. It only preempts those fees and charges that are specifically related to the registration of that motor carrier's interstate authority. The interstate fee, or the Michigan-plated vehicle fee here, is not preempted because it's a regulatory fee that does not relate to the registration of the motor carrier's SSRS interstate authority.\n Of course, it it does. Number one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it applies only to interstate travel.\n Well  \n And and then the the other vehicles pay $100 for the for the in-state fees, and so this seems to me that that on on its face shows that it's like a registration fee.\n Well, Your Honor, I think a couple things. Number one, I think that I believe that if you look at the structure of the Michigan statute, you'll see that under section 2, which contains both the interstate fee and the intrastate fee, virtually all Michigan vehicles that are plated in Michigan the effect of it is that all vehicles that are plated in Michigan will have paid this $100 fee. And furthermore, if you look at section 7 of the Michigan statute, which is 478.7, that involves the registration procedure. That's specifically applicable to the registration of interstate authority. And within that section 7, subsection (4) deals with the payment of the $10 fee for and and it's to be made by vehicles that are not plated in the State of Michigan.\n That's that's the problem.\n Well, that's the argument.\n That's the problem because here we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the fee for them. Well, let me I have a question. I'm trying to test this. Suppose that I have a company in Maine. All right? And I have I decide all my I I have all Maine plates, by the way. And I decide I want my now, let's one word is license plates. I'm going to talk about plating. Another word is the ICC insurance. Let's call it a decal. And the third kind of a concept is whatever you refer to in your statute by a fee. All right? The $100.\n Right.\n All right. Now, suppose in Maine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan to be my home State for purposes of what do you call it? The SS?\n SSRS.\n Yes. And so I go to Michigan, and now I pay all the registration fees here. Do I get a a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to show I did it?\n No. Your Honor, I I you say that you're a Maine company  \n Yes.\n but your principal place of business is in Michigan?\n Yes, yes. So that's right.\n Okay. And your question is?\n Do I get a decal after I go through all this procedure? You have a whole form. I pay $6 for Alabama. I pay $2 for Idaho, and but but I do it all in one shopping place which happens to be Michigan.\n Okay.\n Then do I get a little certificate to put on the truck to say I did it. I I registered my ICC decal everywhere.\n If that vehicle if the vehicle you're registering is plated in Michigan  \n No, it's not.\n Okay. You will pay nothing.\n I know for Michigan. But I have to pay. But Michigan is my I can't ask the question until I get clear on this.\n I'm sorry.\n Don't when I when I go under this this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home State  \n That's correct.\n and I make all the relevant payments to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a piece of paper saying I did it?\n I believe so, Your Honor.\n Fine. Now, I'm now plated in Michigan, and I make Michigan my home State for this. And I go and I make I say, Michigan, I'm going to give you this big check to distribute, but the amount I'm putting here for Michigan, by the way, is zero. And you say pay me $100. No. I'm not going to do it. So I haven't paid them the $100. I haven't paid Michigan everything, but I paid $2 for Idaho. Do I get the decal or don't I?\n To get a decal from Michigan, you have to be Michigan-plated and you have to pay the $100.\n Excellent. Now, if I don't get the decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100 is a charge that falls within the SSI. It is a charge for a decal which shows that I registered the ICC and my insurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me the decal.\n Your Honor, we believe that under the the section 7 of the Michigan law, there is no fee charged for your SSRS.\n I'm talking about a fee. I'm trying to oh, fine. If there's no fee charged and I didn't pay the $100 and I didn't pay anything else, you'd give me the decal. But you said you wouldn't.\n Your Honor, you have to you have to if it's Michigan-plated, that's the triggering mechanism. It's not the that's that's what triggers the $100 fee.\n Mr. Boynton, may I just may I just ask this question? Is part of your position that the Federal statute does not prevent Michigan from waiving the $10 fee on for this particular purpose?\n Our position, with respect to that, Your Honor, is the fact that under section 7 of the Michigan Motor Carrier Act, 478.7, Michigan has no authority to charge a Michigan-plated vehicle any fee at all.\n Right. So that but you're saying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $10 and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are plated in Michigan because they've already charged them $100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being plated.\n Well, I don't know if I'm saying that, Your Honor. I'm saying that the there's a zero charge, and then there's there's another charge with respect to a vehicle fee. The one thing that I need to point out here is that the SSRS is not vehicle-specific. It talks about numbers of vehicles, but the Michigan decal fee for or the interstate fee is vehicle-specific. You have to identify the particular  \n Is that right? Let me let me I wanted to ask this question to see whether it's vehicle-specific. Suppose I have nine trucks. They're Michigan-plated, so I have to pay $100 for each of the nine.\n Interstate commerce.\n Now, suppose I suppose I only pay the fee for eight of them. What happens?\n And how do you want to use the truck? Do you want to use it in interstate commerce?\n No. I've paid for eight, but I haven't paid for the ninth. As I read the Michigan law, it says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or over the highways of this State while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid. Now, if if I can't operate the other eight because I haven't paid for the nine, that sounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.\n Yes, it is.\n I mean I mean the opposite. It's it's not vehicle-specific.\n Oh.\n I've paid for the eight, and I can't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth.\n Well, I think administratively that that wouldn't happen. I I think once you go  \n It seems to me how it reads. Am I reading the law wrong? It says, shall not operate any motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid.\n I suppose that if the for for nonpayment of fees, a motor carrier risks its authority to operate in the State.\n At all. So it's not really vehicle-specific.\n Well, I I think it is. I would disagree with Your Honor.\n Well, the computation is vehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles as hostage for the payment of of any shortfall. That's what you're doing, isn't it?\n So it's carrier-based.\n Well, Your Honor, I would have to disagree with Your Honor respectfully. I think that the that it is vehicle-specific because it identifies the particular vehicle that's involved here. And I I think you have to read the statute, the preemption statute, the scope of what preemption has sought to do here, and not all State fees and charges on motor carrier vehicles are preempted.\n Do you place any reliance in this scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it are people who have their principal place of business in Michigan?\n No, Your Honor. The triggering event for the interstate fee is the plating of the vehicle in Michigan.\n And and anyone can choose to do that? I mean, going back to Justice Breyer's example, anybody can say, well, I think I'd like to be plated in Michigan even though I operate in in other States. My principal place of business is in another State.\n Right. I think all parties have noted, Your Honor, that the under the SSRS it's much more stringent, more rigorous  \n No. I'm just asking about what you do in Michigan.\n Yes. Yes, you can.\n You really can do that?\n You can plate wherever you have contacts with the State. If your principal place of business is in Ohio but you have trucks going to and from Michigan, that that would allow you to plate in State of Michigan.\n You you can plate your whole fleet in Michigan under those circumstances.\n You could you can choose where to plate your feet plate your trucks, and a number of considerations go into that. It's not just the license plating fees. It has everything to do as we noted in our brief, it could have to do with no fault insurance, the weight limits on trucks. It's an economic decision and there's a number of different factors that go into that decision of where to plate a vehicle. In conclusion, I would say that the Michigan Court of Appeals correctly decided this case. And they they found that the challenged fees in these cases are regulatory fees, that they serve the critical function of protecting the people of Michigan that use the highways. And the Michigan Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Thank you, Mr. Boynton. Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States as amicus curiae supports the State in American Trucking and the petitioner in Mid-Con. With respect to American Trucking, in our view the central question in resolving the constitutional issue is not whether it would be possible to apportion the intrastate fee on a more precise basis. The question is whether the Constitution requires it. And in the prior cases that we've cited in our brief, both the older cases dealing specifically with intrastate transportation and the more recent cases dealing with authority to engage in other intrastate businesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authority of States and municipalities to charge flat fees for the privilege of engaging in the local business within the jurisdiction during the the relevant period of time. And that practice  \n That seems to me really to go back on on Scheiner. And I thought we tried to get away from deciding Commerce Clause questions on the basis of whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce, you know, the original package doctrine and things that succeeded it. And you're you're just dragging back in this this inquiry into whether it's really interstate or or rather local.\n Well, with with respect, Your Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the notion that there is a bright, absolute line between intrastate activities which are subject to plenary regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune from State regulation. The Court has recognized that the question is more complicated than that. But in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance, the Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an interstate bus trip could be taxed in in its entirety by the State in which the ticket was purchased because the sale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete event properly severable from the underlying interstate transaction. And the case for severance is all the more powerful here. That is, here we're dealing not with a an aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. It's true that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do interstate business, and it's even true that in some instances the intrastate load may be carried on the same truck at the same time that it's also carrying goods between the States. But the intrastate haul is itself a discrete commercial transaction. To the shipper it's wholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the the truck is also doing an interstate business. And to differentiate this case from Scheiner, one of the things that the Court has looked at in the dormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple taxation. And the Court doesn't just mean multiple taxation in in the abstract because it's necessarily going to be the case that an entity that does business in many States will be taxed in many States. Rather the question is whether there's an undue risk of multiple taxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or the same activity. And that was at real risk in Scheiner because if you imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to Florida and passing through several States on the way, and it's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for entering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage traveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable to say that the imposition of those cumulative trips cumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to Florida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same event. Here we don't have a problem with that. The tax is being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. If a particular truck also makes point-to-point hauls in some other State within the calendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they can't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or the same transaction. The second aspect of of Scheiner  \n Yes, it could. I mean, if if this this truck is making one one haul, it's carrying some goods from Texas to to Maine, but some other goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and just carries it to another place within Tennessee, and then it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it elsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed. It seems to me it's it's one trip. We never used to used to divide railroads on the basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the interstate portions and and the two stops within a State can be regulated by the State.\n I mean, I think you're right that it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of goods between States as a discrete, separable event. But if the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and depositing them at another point in Texas, again from the shipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete transaction. The shipper is unlikely to have any interest in whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods among the States. And it's reasonable to regard that as a discrete event that is taxable by the State in which it occurs. The other point to make about Scheiner is that even if we assume, as the petitioner argues, that the average interstate truck that makes some point-to-point hauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the average truck that does business solely within that State, there's still a whole different class of interstate truckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads that could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage traveled and they're being let off the hook because the State has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity. Petitioners' response to this is that you can't discriminate against one class and then make up for it by by discriminating in favor of a different class. And if this were, to use title VII terminology, a disparate treatment case, we would agree. That is, if a State overtly discriminates against one class of interstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of the law those people are treated less favorably, then we would entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for it by giving more favorable treatment to a different class of out-of-state entities. But here the petitioner is making what amounts to a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a disparate impact claim is not that any particular individual has suffered unfair treatment. The way you prove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect cumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in this case in the aggregate. And there's really no way to feel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't do better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to focus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the basis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of-state truckers that are not currently covered. I'd like to speak briefly at least about the the Mid-Con case. And in our view the best way of understanding to to return to the historical antecedents of the current SSRS provision, in its original form, as enacted in 1965, the statute said it's not an unreasonable burden of on interstate commerce to require an interstate carrier to register its Federal certificate so along as you do so in accordance with the standards of the ICC. If you go beyond those standards, it's an unreasonable burden on commerce.\n I'd like to know the text you rely on.\n That was  \n For for preemption, the text of the current statute that you rely on.\n The text of the current statute is set forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari petition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b). And the statute says, the first sentence, the requirement of a State that a motor carrier providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter 1 of chapter 135 and that refers to interstate transportation providing interstate transportation and providing transportation in that State must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred to in section 13501.\n 13501 deals just with SSRS.\n No. 13501 is the provision that that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation and the Surface Transportation Board. And it basically says these agencies have general regulatory jurisdiction over transportation between points in one State and points in another State and or between points in the same State passing through another State. So in in using that shorthand reference, the Congress just means interstate transportation.\n May I ask this question? Because I know your time is short. Supposing Michigan imposed a new $10 fee per and it identified it precisely as in order to comply with that statute and then reduced its present plating fee from $100 to $90, would that be permissible?\n Well, as long as the again, to in our view the distinctive and disqualifying feature of the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed specifically on vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce. And if Michigan reduced to $90 the extra  \n I'm not saying they reduced to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10 fee specifically designed to comply with the statute.\n As long as  \n Could they do that?\n As long as they were still imposing that additional again  \n The $90 is for plating. It said only only Michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90. Everybody else everybody and everybody also pays the $10.\n As long as that $90 fee was imposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally, but specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's preempted because our reading of the statute is that basically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what you can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to intrastate carriers.\n Where does it say that? Let let me come back to the to the section of the statute you're quoting. You didn't finish the sentence. It says that it's not an unreasonable burden when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary under subsection (c). Subsection (c) is entitled SSRS, Single State Registration System.\n May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?\n Briefly.\n The State doesn't argue that this registration was completed in accordance with this standard. It argues that the provision doesn't apply at all because this is not the sort of registration requirement that the statute speaks of. We think it is because it's imposed strictly on interstate carriers.\n Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Digges, you have 4 minutes remaining.\n Thank you. I'd like to just briefly cover three points. First, I believe that that is accurate to say that the Solicitor General's position is returning us to the pre-Complete Auto days of line-drawing, but more than that, the Solicitor General's position is ignoring the practical effect of these fees on taxpayers. I think the the citation to the Peddler v. Drummer line of cases illustrates that. The only difference between the Peddler cases and the Drummer cases was that in the in the Nippert case and and the Drummer case, they looked at the practical effect on an out-of-state salesman and whether that salesman would be discouraged by the $50 fee that was being imposed from coming into the State. In the Wagner case, they simply said that the fee fell on an essentially local event, didn't look at the form of the fee, didn't look at the form of the fee on the out-of-state salesman. I don't think it can be disputed that to out-of-state that out-of-state salesmen would be equally discouraged from coming into a State because a $50 fee or a $100 fee, whether or not they're carrying the goods with them in at that time or whether the goods are later mailed in. So, again, I think it is returning to the line-drawing issues, and really there is no test that is made as to, after you you draw these lines, what the appropriate test should be. The second point is it with respect to the administrative practicality of apportioning these fees. The purpose of apportionment would not be, as in a highway tax, to to show the amount of highway damage that was done by a truck. The purpose of apportionment here is simply to show the extent of the taxpayer's level of activity in the State. It would be like a general revenue tax in which we're trying to allocate the taxpayer's activity to particular States, make sure that that taxpayer is paying its fair share of the State's costs with respect of the State's generic costs, in this case, generic regulatory costs. So, again, I think that apportionment would be very easy. As Justice Scalia said, the trucking industry is willing to take the onus of this. We bill by the mile. You could do it on number of loads. You could do it in a lot a lot of ways. And by apportioning the fee, you eliminate the burden and you make the out-of-state carrier, who would be otherwise prohibited from only hauling a load or two he would then have the ability to haul that load and and not be discriminated against. The final area I'd like to talk about a little bit is the need for additional the need for evidence in this case. Again, in the Nippert and the Scheiner cases, there they they it was expressly said that there was no need for evidence in the cases because in the general average of instances, the out-of-state trucker will always pay more than the in-state trucker. And in answer to your question, Justice Stevens, I think it was recognized in those cases that there would be some exceptions to that rule. There would be a few out-of-state carriers that would operate more heavily in the State than in-state carriers. But that exception wasn't wasn't what was going to happen and the most often, and that the average of instances, it would always work to the disadvantage of the out-of-state carriers. And and the final point is that with respect to evidence, you have here also a failure of internal consistency test, and this Court has said a number of times that failure internal of internal consistency is not a test related it doesn't rely on specific facts but it relies on hypotheticals. And in this instance, I think there's a very clear failure of internal consistency. Like in Scheiner, there's a cumulative burden on an out-of-state trucker. If a trucker wants to operate in intrastate commerce around the country, it has to and just haul one load in every State, it has to pay 48 times a $100 fee or pay $4,800 in eligible in order to be eligible to haul in all of those States. So that illustrates how that's going to balkanize commerce, that that carrier is not going to be able to pay that kind of entrance fee nationwide. So that carrier will operate in less intrastate activities in in only a few States or maybe none. And again, we think that that defeats the purpose. When Congress passed economic deregulation of the trucking industry, that they wanted to open it up to out-of-state carriers to be able to augment their interstate loads.\n Thank you, Mr. Digges.\n Thank you.\n The case is submitted.\n", "argument in Spector against the Norwegian Cruise Line ": " Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Under the decision below, title IX stands alone as the only major civil rights statute that would permit retaliation against those who complain that the law is being violated. There are at least a half a dozen anti-discrimination laws that do not contain a separate retaliation provision, and every one of them has been found to prohibit retaliation as one kind of discrimination. There's a reason for that. Anti-discrimination laws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation are allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their institutions into compliance.\n Of course, the question is whether that that may be true, but there would be an administrative remedy. The question here is a private cause of action for damages.\n That is true, Justice Kennedy.\n Even even assuming the the validity of your premise, you still have another step.\n I understand that other step, and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by Congress, as this Court every member of this Court recognized in in Sandoval.\n I thought I thought that Cannon we've we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.\n In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action. The first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title IX. That's Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through your opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated. Title IX is violated by retaliatory action against Coach Jackson. He's and and this is an important part of title IX because, particularly here, people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because students are often minors. They're not in the best position to know the budgets. It is people like Coach Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is recognized about the about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.\n It's very it's very useful, I'm sure, but it it could be very disruptive also, I am sure. If I were if I were a coach, one of the first things especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not not getting enough facilities. This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether whether I'm a lousy coach or not. You you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.\n Justice Scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation. And you should take great comfort from the fact, the Court can take great comfort from the fact that retaliation has been established as a violation of all of the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to title VI  \n Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?\n That is correct.\n Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?\n Well, Congress has taken a different approach. In some cases, there would be a textual problem. Title VII, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin. Title and and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision. Title IX speaks upon about discrimination on the basis of sex. And here I think to to allay your concern about the coach, we have had title IX's retaliation provision has been the established law. It was the law at the time Congress it was understood, at the time Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of title VI had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation. Congress enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation. So that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title IX. In over 30 years, there at most we can find 140 reported cases in the Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and in in dealing with retaliation cases. Now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls. When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.\n Do you think that it it is a reasonable description of what happened he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?\n Absolutely.\n Do you think that that remotely describes what happened to this coach?\n Absolutely. First of all, the the court of appeals correctly says in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX violations. But for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position. He is denied the benefit of coaching in the program. He's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation. And this is not a case in which that has concern I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and I understand the special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the Federal funds. This is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted. At that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known. Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that. We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education and  \n But but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation. And was it Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore. You have to show that there's a congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a private cause of action for damages.\n I think the Court  \n And that's that's quite separate from  \n Yes. I I  \n from this from the question of substantive liability.\n I understand that. Here, first of all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when it passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was a background in the law from Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park that that retaliation was considered a part of discrimination. The title VI regulations were themselves well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim language. It provided for retaliation. And moreover, this Court as recently as the Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that Cannon v. the City of v. the University of Chicago creates that cause of action. Now, this case is actually a lot easier than Davis, even taking into account the concerns that that you and other Justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control. This is deliberately undertaken actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally. It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of discrimination. But it's been accepted for more than 30 years by the responsible Federal agency.\n Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them. Yes, litigation for for discrimination against against female athletes, but not not discrimination suits alleging retaliation. That's a whole, new area.\n Justice Scalia, with with all due respect, I don't think there's any way, when the district accepted these funds, that they could have reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be free to retaliate against people who tried to comply  \n Well, but there was there was let's go back to this for just a moment an administrative remedy available for retaliation expressly under the regs?\n That is correct.\n And did this petitioner seek an administrative remedy at all?\n He did not seek an administrative remedy. He went through the school system itself at every level. He went through five different levels, following the chain of command.\n What would the administrative remedy have allowed here  \n Well  \n had it been sought?\n Here, as in Franklin, as in Davis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with race, you can call this to attention to the office of civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an inquiry. Ultimately they have the authority of the draconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the  \n Do they have any other sanction? Because the notion of an administrative remedy ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's complaining. But as I understand it, this administrative process, this detailed administrative process, leads only to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.\n That is correct.\n So that's it. It would not have permitted a restoration of the job to the  \n That is correct.\n petitioner.\n That is not part of the the administrative process is only about institutional funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld the right to bring these actions for what are violations of the statute itself.\n Well, if we don't accept let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that that we're having trouble accepting the the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms. You then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.\n That is  \n So so the the argument is you you should recognize this as a necessity. That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice O'Connor's question. Why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy? And I thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason. So my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude to to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?\n That that is absolutely right.\n What's what are the facts? What's the empirical evidence for that?\n Well  \n Do you know if administrative sanctions have been imposed under title IX against schools?\n Well, I'm sure there have been some instances in which there have been administrative sanctions under title IX. And I don't I do not have figures on those, Justice O'Connor. But let me  \n Have funds  \n let me suggest  \n have funds Mr. Dellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any school because of a violation of  \n Not to my knowledge.\n title IX?\n But I think  \n That could be because  \n I actually have  \n the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach. Of course, they're going to rehire. I I find it hard to believe why a draconian sanction is ineffective.\n Well, if it's never I I  \n It seems to me it's it's overwhelmingly effective. You tell the school you either rehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.\n Justice  \n Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?\n I do have an answer, first, for Justice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greensberger. The sanction has never been imposed under title IX of cutting off funds. And it  \n And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction. Which doesn't help  \n That is certainly not what  \n the girls on the team.\n Coach Coach Jackson would have sought, and and because that process is not one that's responsive to the individual case if you're down in Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office that has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a sanction, the fact of the matter is and it's the reason  \n Well, you're saying the coach cares more about it than the Government does?\n That may well be the case, absolutely. And Coach Jackson  \n Well, if if the Government is charged with with just spending the funds and doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should there be a private cause of action  \n Because  \n when when a private cause of action is harder for us to imply than it than it is to an administrative remedy?\n Because in this case people like Coach Jackson it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to come forward. If he's not able to if he's not protected and able to come forward, if retaliation is possible, then you can't expect the the teenagers themselves to carry this burden. And in fact, it's the reason this Court recognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in Davis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to protect the whistle blower and they're not going to be able to come forward. And it's not just whistle blowers, Justice Kennedy. It's people that want to make their institutions comply and when those efforts at compliance result in penalties against them. It has not led to an excessive amount of litigation, but it has been very effective in giving people comfort to know that they can't be retaliated against. And and I I understand the going to the necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the statute because it is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex. It is part and parcel. The history of discrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing people from their jobs is what you did when they complained about discrimination, when they tried to vote, when they tried to enroll their students in schools, and it is part and parcel of that discrimination. And it is discrimination against Coach Jackson for his actions on behalf of sex. Thank you.\n Mr.  \n I'll reserve the balance of my time.\n Mr. Gornstein, do you have any light to shed on the extent to which administrative sanctions have ever been imposed against schools and and the feasibility of going that route?\n Administrative sanction has never been imposed under title IX.\n They have been under title VI?\n There has been one case in which an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI, Justice Kennedy. It the agency does have some flexibility to attempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the sanction, the final sanction, but  \n Do you take the position that what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the statute as discrimination?\n We do, Justice Justice O'Connor. I'm sorry. Retaliation against a person because that person has complained about sex discrimination under title IX is itself discrimination within the meaning of title IX. And that conclusion flows from four considerations, beginning with the Court's decision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the Court held that a person subjected to retaliation because he complained about racial discrimination against his lessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which only prohibits racial discrimination. Against the backdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have understood its prohibition against sex discrimination to afford comparable protection against retaliation. So a person who is subjected  \n Why would Congress then in some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others not? I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?\n It is, Justice O'Connor, but the explanation for that for in title VII, for example, is that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or national origin, and that such individual's language rules out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about here.\n It rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim. Usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever. That's that's the classic retaliation claim. And that classic claim is surely covered by on the basis of that person's sex. If  \n If it's based on the fact that the that the person is complaining about sex discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have here, Justice Scalia. And that theory of discrimination was recognized in the Sullivan decision. Discrimination occurs when there is retaliation against a person because he's complaining about racial discrimination.\n What was the date of the Sullivan case?\n It was 3 years before Congress enacted section I think it was '68 '69. I'm sorry. '69.\n '69.\n It was '69, Justice Scalia.\n And and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?\n You do not, Justice Scalia, when you are starting afresh, but  \n And we certainly did not with a Spending Clause case.\n That's true, Justice Kennedy. But to answer Justice Scalia's question, first, you operate in the legal context in which Congress was operating at the time, and Congress would have understood and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivan decision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding that there was a private right of action and once in deciding that the private right of action included a claim for damages.\n I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. We said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a Congress that that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or or not. And and that's what you're asking us to do here.\n Justice  \n Just because Congress in in the at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we we have to do that for all these old statutes.\n Let let me talk about the cases that I think the principle that you're talking about emerges from. One is the Central Bank case, and what you were asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and abetters, to the statute. We're not asking you to add words to this statute. We're asking you to interpret the words that are there  \n But what about Virginia  \n in light of the relevant context.\n What about Virginia Bankshares?\n I'm I'm not sure about Virginia Bankshares, but I don't think it it states a principle. The other case that I was thinking about, Justice Kennedy, is the is the Sandoval case. And again, there somebody was asking you to afford a private right of action for something that the statute did not itself prohibit. And what we are saying here is, interpret this statute in light of the legal context that Congress had it, which is  \n Well, it it's arguable except that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated against because of his gender.\n That's correct. But this statute does not require discrimination because of such individual's sex. It require  \n exactly like title VII, but  \n It's it's written exactly not like title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan, which doesn't have a such individual's limitation. And in and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of property violates that statute and affords a private right of action to the victim of retaliation. And so too here. And a person who is victimized by retaliation because that person has been subjected before because he complained about sex discrimination is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this statute.\n And that's where you hang. You you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We have to take out that person's. I I don't it doesn't strike me as a as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex. It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.\n But this is it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations. Inserting the words, such individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation claim, and it's not here. And so it's then you have to look at all the other relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this provision have both interpreted the key agencies have interpreted it to encompass protection against retaliation, and including the fact that there's absolutely no legitimate interest that a a recipient has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.\n Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.\n That's correct. In it we we have taken the position that there is, based on a textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above the use of discrimination. We have not taken that position with respect to the to some other statutes. So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it automatically always picks up retaliation protection. You have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis. And here, though, all the relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for this kind of protection to further the purposes of the statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that this was prohibited, included in I think I wanted to get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending Clause. What the Spending Clause does not require is that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer harassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice, and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision, this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and finally the regulations themselves, which specifically forbid retaliation.\n Are punitive damages available under title IX?\n I'm sorry. Punitive damages would not be available against a municipality or against a but it could be available against some other private recipients.\n Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Thomas.\n Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Justice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the question that you raised immediately. I can't think of any school board lawyer who is called by his superintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and they want to know why you aren't doing this and that who would not be in that superintendent's office that moment because when OCR comes in, they canvas everything. I mean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative teams, they're lay people. They're not lawyers. They come in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I can't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is. And so I say I wanted you to  \n How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX? There are many statutes that  \n And I would want to suggest  \n OCR administers.\n In 1996, we had a conclusion of an OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls. So we we know about OCR, and they're in Atlanta. They are about 167 miles away and when and when they come, they come, Your Honors. If I may, I'd like to get right now to what I had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an implied private right of action under title IX for retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. He's an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.\n How does he differ how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this Court said he could maintain that suit.\n Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one observation. Under 1982, there is not a corollary administrative remedy. So in the Sullivan situation, the only advocate available at that time was the owner of the home. And but I would comment that as he continued in his litigation, he continued to advocate. Under title IX, as we have discussed, for the advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and express your concerns and your issues about what's happening. And we find significance in that because the ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would be the basketball team. In a private lawsuit filed by Mr. Jackson, the damage award goes directly to him. If he's successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to him. In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the future, but nothing from that Federal court would go to benefit the girls' basketball team.\n Well, what what do you make of the the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world? It's it's there there have never there has never been an instance in which funds have been withheld.\n Well, again, Justice Souter, no, the funds have not been terminated. But I can only share with you my experiences with dealing with these people.\n May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate? How many times do they say, well, that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?\n Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that I can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep OCR out. So so therefore  \n But that wasn't my question. My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?\n Well, Your Honor, that was something that was recognized in Cannon. I I think that was cited in several of the footnotes.\n And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.\n But but again, stay mindful. Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get admission to the the med school because of my sex, and she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on the basis of sex. So  \n Yes, but the the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on the the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the that if if once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and and so simply to say, well, they're not within the the primary ambit of benefit of the statute is is not to the point of the argument.\n Justice Souter, let me offer this in two ways. One, it's not realistic. In in other words, when when you have a scenario about the private cause of action, teachers aren't I mean, these parents and and the and especially in Birmingham, we have an athletic director at the school. We have a director of athletics for the whole school system. And so that that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the day, the administration is very conscientious about all of its programs.\n Well, that's to say trust me is is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.\n But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.\n The the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.\n Well, but again, though, Justice Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that  \n Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly the the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?\n But that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process. Now, Justice Ginsburg  \n The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?\n No, it did not.\n And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.\n It's not on the face.\n But the regulation did tell the school not to retaliate in effect. Tell me, does the record disclose what happened to the petitioner, Jackson? What what has been the result of all this? Does the record tell us that?\n No, it does not, Justice O'Connor. And and again, it's on a motion to dismiss, and obviously, once it was  \n Does it tell us that he was removed as coach?\n Yes.\n Does the record tell us that?\n It it does say that he was relieved.\n Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?\n Yes.\n But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's. They pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was associating with people who were black. And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service. Maybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them. Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the the civil rights statute? I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can. Would you do you think it's the contrary answer?\n Justice Breyer, in that context  \n Yes.\n I I would say yes.\n Yes, of course.\n But again  \n So therefore  \n Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action? I I want to know what the hypothetical is.\n I'd I'd like to I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe to to discriminate. And now, I agree with you on that answer. The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being he's associated with people who are being discriminated against. I agree with your answer. And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex that's what I've complained of why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question there are two parts why isn't this the same thing? And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing the second part is once it is included in 1981 in is it 1681(a)?\n Yes.\n Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side. It doesn't support you. All right. That's my question.\n Justice Breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?\n Well, yes.\n And again and I submit to you  \n So you you go ahead. I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race. History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case. So I would like your response to that logic.\n And I would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. So everybody now has access to Congress. The whole spectrum of American society is in Congress. So if Congress is being well represented, when it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a different perspective on it. Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed to some of the citizens of the United States. So, obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in Sullivan, would make sense. But I submit to you respectfully, that's not the case now. Over there in Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face of this statute, it's not there. Retaliation is not there. If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also add as a practical consideration  \n Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there. Isn't that correct?\n But but that's an an investigatory the administrative enforcement scenario.\n But it's the  \n No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim. That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word the words in this statute.\n But don't we go Justice Stevens, don't we go back to Sandoval? Can you in a regulation do more than what the statute requires?\n You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute. That's what that holds. But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park. And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.\n But but again, that's retaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the appropriate office.\n Well I mean, Sandoval is very clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very clear. And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority I was in the dissent did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the same I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it. The the I apply the same reasoning here. The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred. Now, what's what's that's how I'm tracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what you say.\n Well, Justice Breyer, on the face of the statute, I just can't get there. I apologize for that, respectfully, but but I can't. And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up, interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt v. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the Northern District of Birmingham for the Northern District of Alabama made very clear that an implied private right of action was not cognizable under title IX, and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it. And and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham, at very least, because the case was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so anyone who would go  \n We we can't you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari  \n No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.\n Thank you.\n But but to say I was trying to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board when it accepted these Federal funds. It had no way of anticipating that retaliation  \n It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago? Maybe more than that. I don't remember.\n Justice Cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time. The scholars are going to have to debate it for years.\n There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.\n But Congress itself has adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.\n But but if I may, but then Justice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action absent such specificity on the part of the legislative branch. And that just speaks volumes to me.\n It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way  \n Yes, ma'am.\n title VII VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs. So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination, sex discrimination do have a a private right of action, and that was the holding of this Court.\n Yes, ma'am. Well, but but again, it goes goes back to but would that include retaliation? And and  \n Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher. And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it. You have nice words on paper and they'll never be enforced.\n But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher could easily, if they don't get a positive response from the administration, they can call OCR.\n And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy. Sorry.\n No. They no  \n Congress didn't give us enough money to do the job.\n Do we know that? I mean, do we have any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is? Just because they haven't cut off funds  \n I I  \n they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.\n Justice Scalia, that's exactly it. I mean, I have firsthand knowledge that when they call, we're supposed to jump. It's no doubt about it.\n And do they call more than infrequently?\n All the time. And and the other side of that coin  \n This is your personal testimony.\n Yes, ma'am. Yes, it is. (Laughter.)\n And and Justice  \n There is there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.\n Well, I've been in educational law now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school boards. So I have firsthand knowledge. I mean and I've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher ed. I mean, when they come in, they come in.\n How many title IX complaints in your in your experience? You mentioned one. Is there any other?\n Two.\n Two? In how many years?\n In 26.\n Two in 20-something years.\n Yes, ma'am. But they're all memorable. (Laughter.)\n They're all thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Mr. Newsom.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns that have been raised during the the preceding arguments. One is to clarify some things about the scope of the administrative remedy. The other side, with respect, wants you to think that without the implied right of action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out in the cold. That is not true. The administrative remedy it's not just about funding termination. 34 C.F.R. 106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary. The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself touted its flexible approach to enforcement which includes, among other things, as this Court noted in Gebser, citing back to its earlier pardon me decision in North Haven, individualized relief in appropriate circumstances. So the point, as Senator Bayh himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is the threat of of funding termination. So while the OCR is wielding the club of funding termination, they can extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate cases.\n Do we do we have any any empirical evidence as to as to what they have thus leveraged?\n None that I am aware of, Your Your Honor, but  \n The the other side says, look, dead letter. What do we know about such life as there may be in the letter?\n Well well, I will, I assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office to tell you what what the DOJ has and hasn't done. What I can tell you is that that the DOJ manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants. So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.\n You you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not  \n Of course not.\n and if they are inefficient to to raise up private attorneys general to to fill the void?\n Of course not, Justice Scalia, and and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.\n All right. If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides do you think it's unlawful?\n We do not contest the validity of the regulation.\n Okay. If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?\n Absolutely, Your Honor.\n What what is it doing?\n It section 100.7(e), the regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all all it does by its text and its structure makes clear all it does is to govern the internal processes of official OCR investigations. It does not go further than that. This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it was that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action. Another point I want to make about the administrative remedy. Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement. Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources. That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination. But as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this out in some detail there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the either either in the judicial system or at OCR.\n Why is that, do you think?\n Well, my I'm sorry.\n Is it because no remedy is available, or is it because there are just very few instances giving rise to such?\n Well, I think in all likelihood, it is the latter. Certainly I would think that the Court would presume would not presume ill of local school districts and and even State universities, but would presume that they are complying with, if not clearly articulated law, certainly good public policy. The second point is that what the the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.\n Do we decide this case on the assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a complaint of violation of title IX?\n Certainly, Your Honor  \n We should decide it on that assumption?\n You have to take as true, of course, the facts as pledged in the as pleaded in the complaint. Another point I'd like to make briefly is about the comparison to title VII. The other side wants you to look very closely at title VII when you're whether it's on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation in a separate subsection, a separate provision. And I didn't I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during the first argument. I had my head in my own book, but what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the the an instance in which Congress has a choice of two models for for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow Congress to make that choice. That's what happened here.\n Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it this this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983. So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.\n Well, if if I could answer in two parts. First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination. And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model. Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan. First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque. It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary  \n It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.\n Even if I were to grant your assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I presume, would not agree with he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court was trying to do. But even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is is passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable  \n Yes, but it did construe the word discrimination, didn't it?\n No, sir. Discrimination is not even in is not even in title rather, in 1982. So the language is very different  \n On account of race is in it. Right?\n I'll have to confess I don't it does say something like every person shall have the same right as dot, dot, dot, as white persons. But so the the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if that's true for for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would have gotten its clear notice in this case. If you can imagine  \n It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute. We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.\n I agree, and and if and if the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but instead that that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations. So to be sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not retaliate in in the business of an official OCR investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent  \n But it's we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What must you do to comply? And it has in there you don't retaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate? I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.\n And and with respect, I think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this Court has has used in Spending Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR investigation and retaliation generally, but I'm sorry.\n I I really don't get that. If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going that's going to be on our checklist. But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.\n Justice Stevens, may I respond?\n Yes.\n Even granting your assumption, Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to to a private right of action for damages and fees even in in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.\n Thank you, Mr. Newsom.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens.\n Mr. Dellinger, you have about 3 and a half minutes.\n I should make it clear that we're not asking this Court to create or infer a new cause of action. We're asking the Court to interpret the cause of action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress. It was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval. And when you look at the scope of that of that prohibition, that cause of action, why would it not extend to retaliation? The idea that you  \n Other statutes do it separately.\n I understand.\n Other statutes don't view the one as as being incorporated in the other.\n The practice of Congress has not been consistent on incorporating express provisions sometimes because of language differences, but there are half a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have consistently assumed included retaliation as part of discrimination. Section 1981, section 1982, title VI, 1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way. And why would they not? The notion that you have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and expel her for complaining about your admissions policy makes no sense. In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what any administration might do about enforcement is not necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this Court's decision in Cannon. And it's reaffirmed it frankly  \n There are no vagaries in private enforcement. Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity. There are no vagaries there.\n Well, in this case, it has been known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to bring them about by allowing people to step forward. The last point they make is that even if there's a cause of action, and even if the cause of action covers retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination. That makes no sense in law or in logic. If the captain of the boys' basketball team joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls' basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended from their teams or dropped from the honor society in retaliation, it makes no sense. Either they both have they've both been discriminated against on the basis of sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination or neither is. And in this case, it's going to be critically important that this valuable statute, which has meant so much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow them to come forward within the school itself and try to rectify these anomalies in and under title IX. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: These two contract cases concern whether the Government is liable in money damages under the Contract Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self-Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a contract price for the  \n Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate? The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth Circuit went another. And are the claims at all overlapping? How are they differentiated?\n No, Justice O'Connor. They're they're not overlapping. The claims in the Federal Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996. And the Cherokee contract at issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit is fiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement. The section remedial section of the act, section 110  \n But they're certainly at odds on the legal theory.\n Yes, they are, Your Honor. The Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation, the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is enacted by Congress. And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the contracts in this case under the circumstances presented. And to the contrary. We submit that the Secretary's construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo section 106(b) of the act  \n Are the circumstances any different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case and the one in the Federal Circuit? Are are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?\n No, Justice O'Connor. There there is no difference in that respect, and there is an overlap in in this sense. The Shoshone-Paiute contract that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee contract that covered fiscal year 1996. So in that sense, both cases involved the the same relevant issues. The the key, we think, to the resolution of the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to our opening blue brief. The act was amended in this section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding discretion over contract funding issues. In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then directly pertinent to this case is subparagraph (2), which directs which addresses contract support costs. There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of certain items. Incidentally, these items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs, procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by the Office of Personnel Management.\n Does the do the actual contracts reduce the the CSC's to a dollar amount or  \n Yes, they do.\n So so we know they they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.\n That is correct, Justice Souter. In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated contract amount.\n I don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if if you choose. But it seems to me relevant to (a). Does is is part of the submission that the Government used some of the funds that otherwise would have gone to you for its own monitoring and of of health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? Or was it just general overhead for other programs it used?\n It it is precisely, Justice Kennedy, what what you stated. In fact, we can turn directly to page 14a  \n I I stated an or. I what I I stated at the outset?\n The the Government took money for its own Federal functions instead of including contract monitoring  \n Including contract monitoring.\n Including contract monitoring. Including contract monitoring. In fact, they say so in their brief and and defend that action. The the sections on page 12a and 13a articulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of the contract support costs that must be added.\n These are strange contracts, of course, aren't they? I mean, are there any other contracts that the Government has to enter into? I mean, the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to take over, in effect, implementation of the of a Federal health program, doesn't he?\n That is correct, Justice Scalia.\n Well, I why would you expect that this strange kind of contract should should, prima facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations as other contracts  \n Because  \n where where an agency, having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will limit the number of contracts it enters into? But but here you're creating a situation where the agency has to contract and yet has no control over having enough money to to meet the contractual obligations. It seems to me a a strange way to run a railroad.\n It it is a unique contractual situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully anticipated. And and I would explain it this way. First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act which Congress said applies to these contracts. The contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims, then the Court of Claims, and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under the Contract Disputes Act. And the legislative history explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for the stated contract price.\n But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?\n The the procurement contract that is correct. Not the contracts themselves, Your Honor. The the act says that  \n Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.\n the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy. That's correct. These contracts began as procurement contracts. They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they were not enforced under the Court of the Interior Board of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision. Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which it wanted to eliminate. And for that reason, it eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along with it.\n Mr. Miller, do  \n Justice Ginsburg.\n on on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call Federal functions, that it every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal functions?\n Justice Ginsburg, I I would put my answer in this context. There are many sources from which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these contracts. It could have been, yes, as we submit, from the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial administration. It could have been from the up to $88 million increases Congress was making every year. It could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could have been from the regional and headquarters offices that the agencies had where they don't administer services.\n But your your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they  \n That's the duty Congress imposed upon the Secretary. The Secretary was free not to reprogram. That's that's a choice the Secretary had and the Secretary made it. The question is what are the ramifications of that choice and we submit  \n Well, let me ask you another question related. Suppose this is an individual action. These are individual actions. They're not class actions.\n Correct, Your Honor.\n Do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full? Does it just depend on first come to court, first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?\n Your Honor, we we do not believe that that that should be the outcome. That would advantage the contractors that came forward and not take account of the entire situation. We think the global situation has to be looked at. The total amount of the contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994  \n I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip. I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the question, what if there is not enough money to go around?\n If there were only sufficient money to pay half of the contract shortfalls  \n Right.\n without violating the clause and the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of money.\n Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?\n No, Justice Kennedy, and and to the contrary. In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health Service was telling everybody they were paying them in full. They told the General Accounting Office they paid everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in the Government's brief. But  \n So these these are reliance damages in a sense.\n The the tribes expected to be paid. The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be paid in full in the first year.\n I mean, they they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?\n That is correct. That is correct.\n Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually will have available to spend?\n The contractors don't know until the year is over because throughout the year, the Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but stated in a circular, to reprogram. And the appropriations  \n What what do you mean by that? You said a second ago the Secretary had the option to reprogram. What do you mean by reprogram?\n When the Secretary prepares a budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum amount of, say, $1.8 billion. We we take $400 million off the top or $300 million off the top because that was specified by Congress for certain purposes. But the balance is a lump sum. The Secretary crafts a budget. The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar amount is adopted by Congress. Now, Congress can step in and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.\n Yes, but the the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?\n The tribes enter into contracts, as most Government contractors do when they enter into contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if the agency will have the money to pay them. That's okay. The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the appropriations. It's been the law for 120 years that at that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is entitled to be paid.\n All right. So how was that appropriation money in fact used by the Federal Government, do you say?\n The Federal Government  \n There was the appropriation.\n Yes.\n And the tribes had already entered into contracts. Now, how was that lump sum used?\n The agency then, under this Court's teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion over how it spends its appropriation except insofar as  \n Is that what you mean by programming?\n Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for taking me back to your question. What we mean is that the Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding on the Secretary. It's not binding as a matter of law because Congress didn't adopt it. And as conditions change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts its budget, which we call reprogramming.\n So programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.\n Correct.\n Okay.\n And the Secretary retains complete discretion as this Court taught  \n And is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?\n Well, it should not be done without regard to the contract amounts  \n Is that in fact how it was done?\n That is in fact how it was done.\n And is it still done that way?\n Well, the times have changed. Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on the contracts and court costs that the agency has. So there's no question the agency cannot pay more than Congress gives it. When Congress only gives it $100 million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's it. The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more.\n But didn't didn't Congress, even before that, impose a significant limitation on how much the Secretary could pay? What do you with the provision in in (b) of of the section that you were reading from? Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this chapter. I mean, what what money that the Secretary expends is is not expended for programs, projects, or activities that serve a tribe?\n Justice Scalia, we read this this clause with keeping in mind the first sentence first of the sentence. The first sentence, which begins on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract monitoring or administration by the Secretary. And the subparagraph (3) in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions.\n Well, that's all very good, but  \n But then there's an exception.\n then the last paragraph begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter. So this  \n We  \n it seems to me, overrides everything else. Unless unless you can persuade me that that that that provision doesn't give the Secretary the authority to to allocate the available funds among other activities that serve tribes, I I think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.\n Justice Scalia, for for two reasons we think it cannot. First of all, if that exception swallowed up the rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the whole purpose of the act. And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a mandatory rule of construction that Congress has articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government never cites in the statutory interpretation case. And this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the act  \n Wait.\n Page sorry  \n 21 of  \n 21a of our opening blue brief.\n Okay, 21a, good.\n 21a, correct. Each provision of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and each provision of this contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the contractor. That statement is repeated as well in every  \n Oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means. The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.\n So what could it mean? That's our challenge.\n Now, what does it mean?\n We have to give it meaning. We believe it means the as the Secretary always said when and and said at the time these amendments were adopted in 1988, that's services on the ground, the hospitals and clinics. If I walked into the office of the headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville, Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white jackets. I'm not going to see patients and counselors. There aren't programs serving tribes in these headquarters offices, and in these area offices, large portions of what they do are administrative functions.\n All right. May may I interrupt you there? And tell me if I understand the the position in your brief correctly. I thought the position that you took there was ultimately regardless of what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that is actually made. And if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the is the is the agency itself. Its bureaucracy is going to have less money. And I understood your argument to be that given the provisions you read earlier in this section, Congress has made a positive decision that if there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed. Is that your position?\n That is our position.\n If that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?\n Well, we still need to provide some meaning to the to the provision that says the Secretary may not does not have to reduce funding for programs serving other tribes. I guess, I think we do need to grapple with the clause in order not to  \n But but I thought you were saying you could you could the the Secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes. The Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody is going to get the short end, it's going to be the bureaucracy.\n It's going to be the bureaucracy.\n Just give them the just give them the money.\n It's not going to be the programs on the ground serving the tribes. It's going to be the bureaucracy.\n Okay.\n Now, it may be felt  \n To put it this is a competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program of programs. I mean, it's it's not as though it's a bureaucracy against the people. The whole purpose of this was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these programs from Government bureaucrats to tribal bureaucrats. I mean, it  \n Well, I would I would  \n you you paint it as though the you know, who cares about the bureaucrats. The the Government just wasn't interested in the bureaucrats. That may well be, but there there are bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.\n I say that for two reasons. First of all, the the Congress, in our opinion, clearly privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's Federal functions. But more practically, let's look at the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. They took over a hospital that had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract support costs requirement was $2 million. So the contract was in round numbers $7 million. So they get the hospital, $5 million to run it. They don't get the $2 million. Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital. It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy. They didn't get the full hospital operational budget because they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance, undertaking the audits required by Federal law. There were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact, that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.\n Can I ask you a basic question  \n Yes, Justice Breyer.\n which maybe others understand, but I'm confused. Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians. It is simply an ordinary contract. Now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations. So we have to decide was there an appropriation. In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't made. Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts. You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah, I'm not sure. All right. Now, I want if I have the the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these for this Indian expenditure. Just pretend it's a regular contract. What is the equivalent of that $10 million?\n The equivalent of the $10 million would be sums not spent on anything  \n Yes.\n in this case, up to $100 million.\n Yes, okay. And anything else?\n Any of the increases, any of the sums. And then we move to this statute  \n Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there. I want you to tell me why those sums I get the time. I get the amount.\n Why the purpose.\n Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.\n Well, that's one of the things the the Government and we agree upon.\n It was one of the purposes.\n One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act. So that satisfies the purpose test.\n All right. So you think you and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the Government.\n That is correct, Your Honor.\n Okay.\n Well, you can't say that the Government agrees to that. You certainly agree to it.\n No, no. Were it an ordinary  \n The Government  \n were it an ordinary contract.\n In in the hypothetical. No. I think the Government would agree that the rule of Ferris and Blackhawk, the Dougherty rule from the Court of Claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when you sign a contract with the Government and a lump sum appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring Government operations and figuring out how much do they want to boost their functions for this or that or the other, and the  \n So our issue as far as you're concerned and I'll ask the Government the same question is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et cetera? And your claim is, I can't find any difference. And their claim is there will be some difference. Is that right?\n That is correct. They claim these aren't contracts Justice Kennedy.\n Well, you did say the these contracts were unique.\n These contracts are unique. The contracts in Winstar were unique. The contracts in the United States v. New Mexico advance costs advance funded cost reimbursable contracts. Many contracts are unique. The question is whether the distinction makes a difference in the law. The distinction here that these are not procurement contracts, that can't be decisive.\n Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.\n But that's not unique either because the the Government, the Department of Defense in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision of food to our troops in Iraq. That's a quintessential governmental services, feeding the military. But they contract it out. No one would suggest there that just because it's a governmental service, it qualifies that contract as a lesser contract than any other contract.\n Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq. They contracted it out to a private contractor. I mean, what what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these these tribes more governmental power, more self-determination. The whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.\n Absolutely. And even Congress considered  \n That's that's what makes it different from private contracts  \n We  \n even even with Halliburton.\n We  \n I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody.\n We submit that that difference was considered by Congress. In the 1988 amendments, there's even language that says, we're thinking about maybe calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've decided to call it a contract because we want it to be enforceable as a contract, just as other Government contracts for goods and services are enforced. And that was the language of the of the Senate report. They then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a remedy in money damages. In those respects, along with the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Justice Stevens.\n Thank you. Mr. Srinivasan.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for performance of those core agency functions that the agency itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum appropriation among tribes. Now, the tribes have to point to some source of funding within that lump sum appropriation.\n Well, they just did, the 2 percent. So my question to you is the same. I asked, let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing to do with it. It was a typical, ordinary Government contract for pencils. All right? Or for soda water. Now, and everything were the same. Under those circumstances, just an ordinary contract and they point to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in the Court of Claims. But but we have we have a contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the contract because that 2 percent is available, legally speaking, time, purpose, and and amount. Okay? Classic. Now, what's the Government's view there?\n No.\n Is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?\n No. With respect to the 2 percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions, that's not available.\n I'm asking all right. Are is the Government's view then let's treat this just as an ordinary contract? Still it there was no money available.\n With respect to  \n Legally speaking under the time-purpose-amount test.\n Well, Justice Breyer, I'm drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's reserved for core agency functions and  \n No.\n it's been a background principle of Government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that that the Government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out. So I think that informs the interpretation of the subject to availability clause.\n Now, I would like an answer to my question, yes or no. If this were an ordinary contract with a subject to appropriations clause, is would the Government be saying this is invalid because the appropriations were not there?\n Well, you have to look at the particular context.\n There must be a yes or no answer to that.\n It would be no if this statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer.\n No. What it is is a contract for pencils. Can you not is it impossible  \n If if all  \n to make you see what I'm driving  \n If if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.\n Correct, and which are the funds that are that would be available here? Which are they?\n There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because  \n If this were under Blackhawk.\n Under Blackhawk, it would be it would it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be be directed in any particular manner. Now, there are some provisions in the  \n That includes the 2 percent that you keep referring to.\n That that would include in the that would include the 2 percent. But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services. So you'd have to take into account  \n Okay. Then let me do this then.\n those particular provisos.\n You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit. Now, tell me specifically, if you can and this may take you the whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want. What is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?\n Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute. If you look at page 15a of the appendix to to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause. You have to look at the particular context in which this statute  \n Well, the language is the same.\n It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect. It says, notwithstanding any other provision and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and and this is  \n That phrase is the same, subject to the availability of appropriations.\n That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.\n Exactly.\n But the term available and I think this is critical. The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.\n But but the other the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes. It's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your your headquarters operating budget for IHS. So they say, if I understand them, that the that the nonreduction clause doesn't save you here because you could have paid it without reducing things for other tribes.\n I I think that argument is incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause. But second of all, the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to to the terms of the ISDA itself. And if you'll look at page 12a and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1) what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided. And then later on down in the paragraph  \n I don't see that. Where?\n I'm sorry. It's  \n Not less. Right?\n Shall not shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then further down in the paragraph in the last in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency.\n But but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a factual disagreement here?\n I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think it's more of a characterization disagreement. There it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be to be turned over.\n It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable. And they could certainly for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior. Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.\n But but  \n So otherwise contractable sounds like a a statutory question.\n But it it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable. It says, including supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. It's talking about a limitation upon the contractability of functions  \n Correct.\n not the use of funds.\n Well, it's talking about both because the the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds. It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes. And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions.\n But how do you how do you square that with the on page 14a reductions and, as Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions.\n Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section. And our view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal functions were never required to be transferred under subsection (a) to begin with. And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.\n So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and noninherent?\n Oh, absolutely there are. The Federal functions is the broader set of it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform. And the distinction between inherent Federal functions and Federal functions, although it might seem trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal functions.\n Does it ever define them as noncontractable? I mean, I I your answer, I suppose, is well, what what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to  \n It it does.\n the point of contractability?\n It does, Justice Scalia Justice Souter. Excuse me.\n Thank you, but apologize to him. (Laughter.)\n And we describe the the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31. When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance. There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal. And I think what that signifies is that there are some functions that are not contractable and can't be turned over to the tribes.\n That that all may be true, of course. They're talking about don't contract out to the Indians something that should be done in Washington. But what has that got to do with the issue? We're talking, I thought, about about Government contracts. People who enter into Government contracts need certainty. They have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract. And a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that. And under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount. Okay? That's the principle. And  \n You don't think  \n and I don't see anything contrary to that.\n Justice Breyer, one background principle and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves. One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes. And the contracts  \n Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and the tribes did somehow contract away Federal inherent Federal functions?\n No. They specifically  \n They didn't violate that section, did they? The contracts that we're talking about.\n They specifically did not transfer  \n No. So we're not dealing with that. We're dealing with contracts that didn't violate that section. And you're just saying that some of the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that the contracts violated that provision.\n No. The that's correct, Justice O'Connor. What I'm responding to is the suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be diverted to pay for the indirect costs  \n You're not saying you're addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are available.\n Correct.\n That's where your argument is going.\n Correct. It relates to the funds that are available. And the tribes' position  \n And you rely on the statement in (a) that the the only funds that are available are funds that include funds to to pay for supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.\n Right. Not funds  \n And not funds that are used to pay for administrative functions that are not contractable.\n Right. We think that funds for inherent Federal functions were taken off off the  \n Can I  \n You said that  \n Can I ask you sort of a basic question that I'm having trouble following? As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?\n Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.\n But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.\n In in part it was mandated by the statute.\n In part but not in whole.\n Perhaps not in whole  \n Well, that's the point.\n but at least in significant part. And let me but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated. The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built. And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute. And that I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.\n Is the is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?\n It was I I think in principal part it was mandated by the by  \n Principal part, but  \n Well, let  \n Does that mean that there was not enough?\n At least as far  \n They could have made it 97 percent  \n insofar as what I've said with respect  \n and had enough money  \n Sorry.\n to pay these contract obligations.\n No, Justice Stevens.\n See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.\n No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that. And that's what I'm trying to explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in in Congress' appropriation committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.\n Are you telling me that the committee reports are are binding law?\n They're not binding law, Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.\n No. But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements. And in in that conflict, I don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.\n It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract.\n And and their their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the that the nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying I think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed. Yes. And if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what they're saying.\n That is what they're saying, Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy. There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.\n No, he's not. But if if where I'm really coming from, to be honest and I'd like you might as well reply to what I'm actually is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions. (Laughter.)\n I I read here look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes. And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. So if they're saying that money from a contract point a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.\n Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.\n Well, there is is the kind the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another. What did they think?\n No. They thought the the board the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the Board of Contract Appeals, thought  \n Well, I'm thinking the Board of Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.\n Well, I don't think the Board of of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from. They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient. Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with. But even if you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core Federal function  \n No, but if that's true, then everything then every penny in the in the IHS bureaucracy qualifies. I mean, that swallows the that swallows the entire budget.\n Well, let's Justice Souter, if I if I could, let's look at the particular sources  \n No, no. But I mean, just conceptually isn't that isn't that the the implication of what you're saying?\n You you can't limit it to inherent Government functions. Both the inherent and the noninherent Government functions would fall within this provision  \n Yes.\n if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.\n Well, I I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe. With respect to the administrative support  \n On on that point on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full. And he said, I asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell the court what programs existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?\n I don't I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.\n Now, what does that mean?\n So  \n I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs. Are we talking just about existing programs that that the Government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government is at liberty to benefit tribes? And so what if the contract support costs are, as a result, diminished? We're still doing good for tribes.\n We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes. And again, one of the new facilities  \n It's strange to talk of reducing is is not required to reduce funding for a new program. I mean, for a new program, there isn't any funding. How can you reduce the funding for a new program?\n Because  \n That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.\n Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases. And one way to see that is 25 U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year. So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount.\n Mr. Srinivasan, you you alluded a moment ago in in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs. Did those declarations get specific in the way that her original question was was asking about? Did it say did the declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe and so on, or was it did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?\n Well, they they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example. I think the one example that they give and maybe there are more is is a diabetes program. But I think it's more the general principle  \n Was that a new program or an existing program?\n That's an the the particular example is an existing program. But I think it's more  \n It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.\n You're you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?\n Yes. It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the as the the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.\n Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.\n Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.\n Is there some way to avoid these problems now? Has anything changed?\n Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.\n Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?\n I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to to divert the entire amount of administrative support for for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years. Thank you.\n Mr. Miller, you have about 4 minutes left.\n Justice Stevens, thank you. First, I'd like to address the availability of appropriations clause briefly. That is a term of art with a well-established meaning. This Court in Morissette said that if unless there's a contrary direction from Congress that the term of art should not be given its well-established meaning, it controls. And that is the meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation is available for the purpose during the time and in the amounts necessary to fully  \n I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.\n Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.\n Thank you, Mr. Miller.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether, 42 years after this Court decided in Douglas v. California that indigent defendants have the right to the assistance of counsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal  \n Well, now, Douglas didn't involve a guilty plea, I guess.\n It did not, Your Honor. It was a trial case.\n And did the Court say anything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea? I guess it didn't.\n It did not. None of this Court's cases in the Douglas line have turned on whether the conviction was by trial or by plea.\n Does that make a difference or could it?\n I don't believe it does, Your Honor, because as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea. Of course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases this Court well knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines very complicated issues of sentencing law arise. And now Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps more complicated than the Federal system that's been in effect since the 1980's.\n Did did your client waive any right to appeal here in connection with the proceedings of the plea?\n He did not waive a right to file an application for leave to appeal. Because of the  \n What did he waive?\n He waived the right to have a to have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in other words, the right to automatically have full briefing and oral argument. So what he agreed to by pleading was to go through the application for leave to appeal procedure which involves a preliminary determination of merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.\n Why didn't he waive the right to have counsel for that for that purpose since that was the law in Michigan?\n Well, he did not first of all, as a matter of fact, he did not. He was never told at any point during the plea proceedings that he would be giving up his right to counsel.\n Well, he was told what what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.\n He was told that under certain circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.\n Right.\n But the judge never said, under any other circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.\n Well, isn't that a perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and B, that C and D might have been that C and D will not be given?\n It might be a natural inference for somebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbert is a special education student, functionally illiterate. And nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his right to counsel.\n Well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?\n I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy, because this is a case in which the State is making a waiver argument. And, of course, the waiver argument is not part of is not the intent of the statute. What the statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't be getting counsel.\n Well, I I take it you would challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were advised?\n Absolutely.\n And even if he said, I hereby waive?\n Absolutely, we would because that is a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor. That waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible for appointed counsel on appeal. So that waiver has no effect whatsoever on  \n Well, wouldn't I'm I'm sorry.\n It would have no effect whatsoever on money defendants I'm saying.\n Wouldn't your position be different if he had been advised that he had exactly the right that you claim he has, and the court said, however, in Michigan you may not enter the the plea unless you waive that right? If if you don't want to waive that right, which I've just explained to you, we'll we'll have a trial. Would would your answer still be that that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?\n The waiver would be unconstitutional under those conditions because it is a discriminatory waiver. To show how breathtaking the State's argument  \n How why is that prejudicial to him? He says, okay, I can't plead guilty. I really did it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.\n I'm sorry.\n Why doesn't he just have a trial? He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.\n Well, as this Court has long recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit. I mean, excuse me. A guilty plea provides very substantial benefits. And so the effect of the Michigan statute then would be only the money defendant can receive the benefits of a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors corrected.\n Now, is that what you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's that it's far-reaching.\n Yes. Well, not only that, if the State's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have free transcripts. You can't have the waiver of the filing fees. In fact, the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have counsel at sentencing.\n These are all disparate impact arguments. There's there's you're not making any argument that the State intentionally discriminates against the poor. You're just saying the effect of this is harder on the poor than it is on the rich. But I thought our our equal protection cases have have said that disparate impact doesn't doesn't hack it as far as equal protection is concerned.\n Well, Justice Scalia, I actually have two responses to that. First, this is intentionally aimed at the poor. Looking at 770.3a, the statute under in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent. It refers to the indigent. So this is a statute that on its face is is taking away the right of the indigent and only the indigent to have have an attorney. So I don't agree that is is a simply a disparate impact case. But in the context of appellate counsel for a first-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have have not applied the same line of analysis that this Court has applied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear most recently in the MLB case  \n In any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it  \n Yes.\n it is not a disparate impact case at all  \n Yes.\n because it affects only indigents.\n Yes. There is no question that this statute was enacted for and specifically applies only to the indigent. It has it has no impact whatsoever on the wealthy, and it's aimed at the at the indigent only. So I do I do not agree that this  \n Whenever a State has has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor? That that seems to be an extraordinary proposition. The State isn't picking on the poor. It's just saying that that the the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this in this one instance of guilty pleas. And and you say that that is intentional discrimination against the poor?\n It's not a a disparate impact claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor. The statute was designed to take away counsel from the poor and only from the poor.\n So any cutback on benefits that is given on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.\n I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.\n Just this one because that's your case.\n This case certainly is.\n You're saying this is case like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal.\n Yes.\n You're bracketing  \n This case in many ways the restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to appeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse than those that were struck down in Douglas because at least in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues. We don't even have that here. All we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript. Under the Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts, his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily be done by counsel. And so  \n May I just understand one point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me? In your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?\n Oh, it's my it's certainly my contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-tier direct felony appeal on the merits.\n So that ultimately your case rests not on equal protection but due process.\n It's a merger of both principles, as this Court said  \n But it's one as much as the other, isn't it?\n Yes.\n I mean, you're we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel.\n Yes, Justice Souter.\n So you're you're retracting the pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want to do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as as directed against the poor.\n It is directed  \n Or not?\n It is directed against the poor, which is why there is an equal protection component to this argument, but this Court's cases  \n But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.\n I believe that's right. It's it's difficult I have to confess, Your Honor, it's difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and equal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line, and this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a certain merger. Also, I believe in Smith v. Robbins this Court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the lines in these cases. But  \n You're you're saying that the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of merely providing counsel as a matter of grace. That's what due process does for you. Because they have to provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have a very clear equal protection case which you would not otherwise have. Isn't isn't that the way the two work together?\n I think that's right, Justice Souter. I think I agree with that.\n Can in your view, can the State require a waiver of the right to appeal for everyone?\n That's a question this Court hasn't decided, and I don't have a position on that. But that's far different from this case because that would not be discriminatory.\n Well, I'm not so sure. It certainly goes to the importance or the significance of the underlying right. My understanding is correct me if I'm wrong that in the Federal system, we require waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence is calculated, as I understand it.\n Yes.\n And do you question the lawfulness of that?\n I don't. And that that case has not come before this Court yet, and so I don't know how this Court would decide that case if it comes. I know some of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellate waivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea. One thing the Michigan statute is does is it takes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents without negotiation. It's it's the baseline.\n But, Mr. Moran, if if you're if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal. Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal. If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.\n But, Your Honor, the problem is is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor.\n That's an equal protection claim.\n That's an equal protection claim.\n But you've you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim. If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver, then apart from the from the dispute in this case as to whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur, there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal protection claim.\n I'm really not sure that you can separate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment again, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know this Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that there is there is a component of both. And it's precisely because of these sorts of questions that I think you have to view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the Griffin/Douglas line.\n In any case  \n Where where do we find the waiver here? Is it in the joint appendix?\n Well, it's my position there was no waiver, but the  \n But you referred to something that was waived.\n Yes.\n Where would we find that?\n Well, the plea proceeding. It's the plea proceeding. And it's  \n Well, don't take your time to look it up. Maybe counsel for respondent can find it for us.\n It's it's in the joint appendix  \n All right.\n beginning on page 19.\n It's their argument anyway. Let them  \n I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a a right to have a counsel on appeal. He can waive a trial. He can waive a jury trial. But before he has to before he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional right to a jury trial.\n That's right.\n And why wouldn't he also have to have the to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?\n Well, that's my position Justice\n All right. That has nothing to do with equal protection. It has to do simply with a very common sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial, et cetera. So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has a right to a lawyer. Now, if he wants to go back and waive that right, fine.\n That's right.\n That's all. That's the end of it.\n That's right.\n So what's all this complicated thing about?\n If an indigent, after being sentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to go on appeal by myself, which is actually a a right this Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to represent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent is allowed to would be allowed to represent himself or herself on appeal if they chose to do so. The problem here is that the statute purports to take away the right, and it's our position that this is a  \n No, no. You'd have to say the statute is wrong in taking away the right.\n Yes.\n But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right.\n That's right. We have no problem with a voluntary waiver. We certainly have a problem with a forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea which produces tremendous benefits in Michigan, as everywhere else, unless unless you agree to waiver  \n Oh, but but that happens all the time. I mean, the waiver waiver of appeal in in guilty in guilty pleas. That's that's not permissible either?\n I take no position on that. It may or may not permissible.\n Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made.\n But it's far different because that's something that can be obtained in negotiation. But what we would have  \n Well, Mr. Moran, here on page 22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the defendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea, you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right.\n Yes.\n And you think that was not effective?\n No. That was effective. That that's referring to the automatic appeal that he would have if he went to trial where he would have full briefing and oral argument. The Michigan  \n Well, I it doesn't say that.\n No, it doesn't. This was a this was a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of of respects, but it  \n Well, he does  \n I'm  \n he does go on to say that that he can appoint a lawyer for in certain instances. He doesn't complete the explanation by saying there are other instances and when I will not appoint one. That he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.\n Yes, he was.\n He had a counsel at the plea hearing.\n He did.\n I'm mixed up again. What is the answer to this? I I would have thought that even if those words that Justice O'Connor read referred directly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us in other words, the one that's at issue that still he'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that appeal before he could waive it.\n Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree.\n And does anybody dispute that?\n I believe  \n Is that at issue here?\n I I believe the State might dispute that. I'm not sure. What the Michigan constitution does, Justice O'Connor, if I may come back to your question, is it says that for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, they are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, and they have they then have to proceed by the application for leave to appeal. And so the Michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method. And so Michigan's appeal, after a guilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several other States, Virginia, West Virginia, and and several other States have guilty plea appeals.\n That's a strange terminology. It doesn't provide a right to appeal. It it provides a right to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an appeal. A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to get an appeal.\n It's framed in terms of a of a right. Page 2 of the brief  \n So you have an absolute right to ask for an appeal.\n Yes.\n But that's not a right to appeal. It's a right to request an appeal, which can be granted or denied.\n Yes.\n Okay.\n But it's a it's what Michigan has done is it has changed the method of the appeal. And so Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by petition. West Virginia has a first-tier by petition and  \n Well, it's done more than change the method. It's changed the entitlement. The court can simply say we're not interested in your appeal. It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.\n Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not how the the Michigan Court of Appeals works. The Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And so in Mr. Halbert's case, the Michigan Court of Appeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to to identify his issues, with an order saying that there was a lack of merit in the grounds presented. That is a preclusive decision on the merits of his case. That  \n That's just but that's just boiler plate, isn't it? That's what they say in all these cases.\n Yes.\n And I think Michigan cites a Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the merits.\n That  \n It's People v. Berry?\n Yes. That was a decision of the Michigan Supreme Court referring to its own orders denying applications for leave to appeal which are not on the merits. The Michigan Supreme Court denies the applications for saying by saying, we are not persuaded that we should hear the questions presented.\n Well, why wouldn't it be the same if the if it's a discretionary appeal at the intermediate appellate level?\n Because the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-correcting court. And so it issues orders saying denied for lack of merit. And the Michigan Court of Appeals dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said, without exception, that is a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.\n Didn't didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case was that the name of it?\n Yes.\n Didn't it say that the that the intermediate court's denial of of appeals was a discretionary judgment?\n It called it a discretionary appeal, Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And in fact, the very author of the  \n That was a dissent, though.\n That's right, but the very author of the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year later or 2 years later describes the effect of of an order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and rejected the merits.\n So, in effect, it's discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom line, whether they give it full dress or or merely discretionary denial is is an implication on the merits.\n Yes, exactly as in Virginia. In Jackson v. Virginia, the Court recognized that the the Virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a petition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and that each petition is considered on the merits, and a denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine. And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now is exactly like the one in Virginia.\n Is that something the intermediate appellate court has said? Have they said that, that we have a a discretionary appeal, but every in every case it's a merits decision? We don't have any decisions that say we are exercising our discretion not to review.\n If a if a appeal or an application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect, then the court will occasionally issue an order denying the application for that reason. But for any properly filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding practice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.\n This means, I would presume, that that we would we would have to give our Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all on the merits.\n And they do.\n Federal courts do?\n Yes.\n They assume that all factual and legal arguments have been decided against the the person applying for a discretionary appeal?\n Yes. After Abela v. Martin in the Sixth Circuit. And there is a a whole host of Federal district court decisions in the Eastern and Western District of Michigan all saying that when an order is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the AEDPA standard of review applies. And so the State obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so the State very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite what it says because they are hoping that this Court will conclude that it is a discretionary appeal. In fact, the State  \n Mr. Moran.\n has made an even more radical argument in its brief. The State maintains that the appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the to the actual function of that court because there is a provision that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case, after sentencing, that there are issues that she should have raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and then the application that follows after that to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal. I'll just point out that even the State's amicus doesn't agree with that, and and rightfully so in light of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.\n Mr. Moran, before your your time is up, I did want to know what is your position on let's say that there is you prevail and there is a right to counsel for these applications to appeal. And if counsel looks at the case and determines that there is no tenable ground for an appeal, could counsel file the equivalent of an Anders brief?\n Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in fact, I have done that personally. Before I became an academic, I worked at the State Appellate Defender Office in Detroit and was appointed to represent indigents on plea appeals. And in a significant percentage of the cases I can't quote you the numbers off the top of my head after reviewing the case, the appellate counsel then concludes that there is no merit, that there are no grounds to proceed, that the defendant in fact got whatever it was she bargained for in the plea bargaining, at which point then either a motion to withdraw may be filed or or the equivalent, the Michigan equivalent, of an Anders brief. And so that is done in a number of cases. It is our position that that procedure actually helps improve the appellate process in Michigan because without that process, all you have are indigents like Mr. Halbert, a special education student with mental disabilities, trying to identify his own issues and fall and filing, in in his case, with the help of a fellow prisoner because he could not have done it himself the help of a fellow prisoner, an application that is completely incoherent, misses several issues that are right on the face of the record, correctly asserts that his sentencing guidelines were misscored but but without explaining why, without even identifying which sentencing guidelines were misscored. And in fact, he received a minimum sentence that was approximately three times too high under the sentencing guidelines. The State concedes that one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in the State's favor erroneously. We concede one of the one of the sentencing guidelines was scored in Mr. Halbert's favor erroneously. But then there were two others, and the most important ones, the OV, Offense Variable, 13. That was scored for 25 points in both cases. And so Mr. Mr. Halbert, in fact, received a sentence that was much too high. Michigan requires Michigan is one of the few States that requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal or they're lost. And so at that point, Mr. Halbert had to figure out a way to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel hearing, which requires an evidentiary hearing at which trial counsel must be called, assuming trial counsel is still available to be called, all from prison, and there was no possible way he could do that. So it's not very surprising that even with the help of a fellow inmate, that his application for leave to appeal was completely incoherent. The fellow inmate actually did write the the trial judge and say we need to have an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel. But under the statute, the judge had no discretion to grant that motion. Under the statute, only if there was already an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, only then would the judge be required to appoint counsel, and of course, the guidelines, as misscored without objection from defense counsel there was no upward departure at that point. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\n Very well, Mr. Moran. Mr. Restuccia.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I want to start with the factual claim regarding the waiver that the Court identified, pages 22 and 23 from the joint appendix, being the point at which Mr. Halbert, in fact, waived his right to the appointment of appellate counsel. I think Justice Scalia is right in noting that he was told specifically it's under these conditions you'll be appointed a counsel; under these conditions, you might be appointed counsel. From context it's unambiguous that he would otherwise not receive counsel. And what's important is at the joint appendix on page 45, the trial court, in fact, made a factual finding on this point. So in order for this Court to conclude that Mr. Halbert did not waive his right to appellate counsel under the particular circumstances, you would have you would have to conclude that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its factual finding.\n Well, I mean, wouldn't we have to conclude that if we're going to apply the same standards here that we usually do in in the plea waiver situation? I mean, we the the classic point of it all is the knowing the the intelligent, voluntary waiver of a known right. And leaving aside the equal protection problem here, even if we didn't have that, I don't see that there would be have been an adequate waiver here because he was never told that he had the right that he now claims as a matter of due process. You indeed, dispute it.\n Yes.\n But unless he were told that, the the waiver that that depends upon parsing the difference between must and may in the two paragraphs of explanation certainly wouldn't be taken as the predicate for a waiver of a known right.\n I I think that the colloquy makes clear that he does not he's not going to have an appeal as of right, and then when told that  \n Well, the the appeal of his right the appeal as of right point, as I understand it, is a different point. What they're getting at there is it will be discretionary with the reviewing court whether your case is reviewed on the merits on some point if you ask for it. We're here dealing with the right to counsel, and it seems to me unless he were told that he had the right to counsel that he claims and he then waived it, that there wouldn't be a an an adequate waiver under Boykin.\n I think in in context when told that only under these circumstances you're going to receive counsel in bringing discretionary application, that it's clear that he is waiving in his decision to go forward with the his plea  \n Look, the imagine I'm just repeating what Justice Souter said. There must be it's so obvious that there must be an obvious answer, but I haven't heard the answer. He knows Michigan law or his lawyer does. The Michigan lawyer looks at the statute. It says a defendant who pleads guilty shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review with some exceptions, which they claim are inadequate. So he thinks the law is shall not. I have no right. So he doesn't not only not only is he not waiving a known right, there's nothing for him to waive. He has no such right. Now, obviously, when there's nothing for him to waive, how could he waive anything? And obviously, a person who's told, hey, you don't have a right to appeal no matter what and then he says, okay, I waive my right to appeal, I mean, really.\n I think that the the for the two questions that are asked, he explains the court explained to him he didn't have appeal as of right but then said  \n Okay, that's the end of it. Right?\n But then and then the the  \n But he had an appeal of right until he pleaded guilty.\n That's right.\n And that's where that's what the waiver consists of. To say he didn't have an appeal of right, no. That's he had an appeal of right up until the point where he pleads guilty, and that's what and that's what the judge is asking.\n Precisely.\n Do you want to do you want to plead guilty, even though if you plead guilty, you'll get you'll get a lawyer only under these circumstances.\n Precisely.\n The court didn't say only  \n And that's what we're deciding is  \n That's the problem.\n That's exactly the issue in front of us. Is it constitutional or not constitutional? And waiver has nothing to do with it.\n I think that I also want to make the point, of course, that there was a factual finding, so if this Court did conclude, it would have to find the trial court was clearly erroneous. The  \n Mr. Restuccia, the we are dealing here, as is not uncommon, with someone who is learning disabled, mentally impaired, and the trial court did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. It said only when if this exists, I must, and if that exists, I must, but did not say if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal. And I was curious as a matter of what is going on in Michigan trial courts now. Do judges routinely tell defendants who plead guilty tell them not only when the court must give them counsel, but if you plead, you relinquish your right to counsel in seeking leave to appeal? Because that  \n Yes.\n that was never imparted in this case.\n The advice concerning right to appeal, the one that was used in the trial court here, was a form from 2000. The the 2004 form is available from the Michigan Supreme Court web site, and it has been modified now that because the trial court it seems apparent that he was reading from the advice concerning right of to appeal. The way it reads now is it will say you are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at public expense to assist you in filing an application for leave to appeal. So this this the colloquy now would happen differently, but I think that  \n Of course, your case is a little stronger than than the court just asked just saying I must appoint counsel in this circumstance and I must appoint counsel in another circumstance. That might have left open the implication that you could appoint counsel in other circumstances, but the court went on and to say I might appoint counsel in this circumstance and I might appoint counsel in the other circumstance. So if there's any implication from it, the implication is not just that I have I have listed all the areas in which I must, but it's also I have listed all the areas in which I either must or even may, if there's an implication.\n I think I think that's right.\n Well, apparently the people who who redid the model instructions thought that this would be a clearer one, to tell him up front you don't get counsel if you don't fit under these exceptions.\n That's right. And they they did they did modify the form. So on the question of the underlying constitutionality, I want to I want to make a few points, that the the threshold question really is whether there's an appeal as of right in Michigan for a plea-based conviction. Michigan law is clear that there is no appeal by right. It's an application process and it's a discretionary review. The Michigan Court of Appeals has no obligation to correct errors in these cases, has no obligation to review the merits.\n Do you agree with your opponent that for AEDPA purposes, they treat the intermediate decision as a decision on the merits?\n No. The law in the Sixth Circuit is in fact in conflict with a case an earlier case, McKenzie v. Smith had determined that the a decision with that language, that virtually identical language, is not is not entitled to deference.\n So your opponent has misrepresented Michigan law.\n No. I didn't say I wasn't suggesting that. Abela is one case stating one position. McKenzie, an earlier case, stated another position.\n But he says there are dozens of cases at the district court level that apply AEDPA in the way he described. Is that wrong?\n Well, he didn't cite those cases. I  \n No, he didn't, but do you think he's wrong?\n I I know that our office handles all the habeas habeas corpus  \n Do you think he's wrong?\n I think he is wrong. The  \n Are you going on on record as saying that Michigan does not and will not, in the United States courts, claim any AEDPA deference as a result of one of these determinations?\n The Solicitor General made that position clear before the argument before this Court in Tesmer v. Kowalski. So we have not been advancing that claim. In fact, we've been advancing a claim  \n And you have not been and and Michigan lawyers have not been advancing that claim in the district courts?\n The all the habeas petitions are run through the office of the Attorney General, so that the when the Solicitor General from the State of Michigan instructed our staff not to advance that claim, that means all habeas cases in Michigan essentially there will be that argument will not be advanced.\n So, so far as you can tell, that's the way it's been.\n That's right. That's right. And because there is no appeal as of right under Michigan law, this the Douglas case doesn't govern the disposition. Ultimately the the controlling is Ross. And the issue then is whether Michigan provides a meaningful access to an indigent defendant who wants to bring an application for leave. That's really the I think the heart of the constitutional issue. There are three distinct characteristics of the Michigan system. The the nature of the review is discretionary, and I think comparable to the kind of review in Ross that was described by this Court for the North Carolina Supreme Court. Mr. Moran makes a claim that the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. With regard to applications for leave where there is no right to have the merits reviewed, it is not an error-correcting court. In fact, one of the reasons for the legislation in Michigan, the reason the Michigan constitution was changed was because of the heavy volume that the Michigan Court of Appeals was facing. There are 28 judges in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and they produce  \n Do they all sit together?\n No. They're panels of three. They issue about 4,000 opinions each year. So each judge is responsible for authoring  \n But it's just one court.\n One court. That's right. So each judge is responsible for authoring between 130-140 opinions, having to join in another 280. So resource allocation is one of the pressing concerns in the Michigan Court of Appeals. The situations in which the court of appeals will grant leave on application are rare. It's it's reluctant to grant leave in these cases in part because of the  \n Then why if it's just denying or not granting appeal, why does it use the boiler plate, for lack of merit in the grounds presented?\n It's used that standard order for the last 20 years or longer. The only Michigan Court of Appeals case in only published case in an application for leave setting is the Bobenal case cited by the people in our the State of Michigan in its brief, in which the Michigan Court of Appeals said there is no this is not a determination on the merits. The only published case for Michigan in which there was an application for leave from a plea-based conviction is People v. Berry in which the Michigan Court of Appeals, after initially having denied leave, then in a collateral attack granted leave on the very same issue and said that its original  \n Why sorry. Finish. I just had a I wanted to go back to something you said, but I want you to be finished.\n Could I ask about grounds presented before we get off this? Is it conceivable that the lack of merit in the grounds presented means lack of merit in the in the grounds of application? Is is the applicant required to state why this particular appeal is worthy of being entertained?\n They're supposed to raise those arguments. I think that's exactly right, that merits can have different meanings, and it can it can relate to whether it would justify the resources of the court to examine the underlying merits of the claim. I think that's right. That's one understanding of the of the order that's consistent with the way it's been treated by the court of appeals and also, most importantly, by the Michigan constitution, when the people of the State of Michigan said trial-based convictions, there's an appeal as of right. For all other convictions, for plea-based convictions, it would be by leave. The Michigan's Supreme Court, in examining this very question about the nature of review, said that it was discretionary.\n What of Mr. Mr. Moran's point that this whatever the merits are, it counts as law of the case and it's it conclusively determines the issues presented?\n That's not what happened in in People in the Bobenal case, which was a court of appeals published decision where the order read virtually identical identically to this one, and the court of appeals said it could would not be bound by its original denial of leave for the lack of merits on the grounds presented and reached the merits of the claim. The same thing happened in in the Berry case in which  \n Well, that was the same court, though, wasn't it?\n Right.\n But what what about preclusion on other courts?\n The  \n In litigation in other courts. They did did they ever say there is no claim or issue preclusion in other courts as a result of of our denials?\n The court of appeals was only examining its effect on itself, and wasn't examining on subsequent courts.\n And any any court, I mean, in in theory, can can revise its own its own opinions. But the I mean, we look to preclusion really on on the effect of the judgment in another court, and I take it they have not ruled on that.\n Well, but both both opinions, in Bobenal and Berry, the court said it was not a ruling on the merits. In other words, if a subsequent court then said it was a merits determination, it would be inconsistent with the holding from Bobenal and it would be inconsistent with Berry with saying the merits have not been reached.\n And they have said the same, you tell us, as to Federal courts.\n Right. The Federal courts have  \n I mean, that's another court, and and they are not asserting that they've decided on the merits in Federal court.\n The Federal courts have been ambiguous. In other words, the Abela case they said  \n I'm not talking about what the Federal courts have said. I'm talking about what what Michigan has said and and what the court of has the court of appeals spoken on that subject?\n Yes. The court of appeals in the Bobenal case said, in fact, examining virtually the identical language of the issue raised here, that this was not a decision on the merits and that it was not itself bound as law of the case because the merits had not been resolved. I think the Bulger case is kind of the paramount case because it is the Michigan Supreme Court conferring the proper legal understanding of the applications for leave, and it said that the nature of the leave is discretionary. I think that fits with common sense understanding because there is no right to have the merits reviewed. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to say the application were discretionary if a defendant would have a claim to have any error corrected. Otherwise, he would have a claim on the court of appeals. The court of appeals has full authority to make the determination that even if everything alleged is true, it's not going to correct the error.\n Look, this is what I'm I'm interested in. It seems like Michigan is unique here. Why not do, if you're worried about resources, what other States have done? You just say, okay, of course, you have a right to an appeal and, of course, you have a lawyer. We'll give it to you if you're poor. But, by the way, if you want to plead guilty, we're not entering into that deal unless you waive it.\n Well, I think that, in a way, Michigan provides a a greater protection by enabling itself. What the court of appeals is essentially doing with its review is for the for a case where there's a an an egregious set of facts, it can reach in and grant an application and review it on the merits. It's a it's it's a kind of a determination about resource allocation, making kind of the hard choices about policy decisions that States have to make.\n Is this a case where it would meet the standard for granting leave to appeal?\n No. This for for Mr. Halbert  \n Because of the error in scoring?\n In fact, anyone who's very familiar with the Michigan guideline system would recognize that Mr. Halbert, if anything, received a break in the scoring of the guidelines. That that ultimately the Offense Variable 13 is a very easy answer to why it was properly scored.\n You take the position that in fact there was no error in scoring.\n No. The there was no error in scoring. The Offense Variable 13 claim relates to three whether the defendant had committed three three offenses against a person within the within 5 years. Michigan allows a determination based on preponderance even if there was no conviction entered. Mr. Halbert was a serial child molester who admitted to having sexually assaulted his 14-year-old stepdaughter, a 10-year-old girl, a 6-year-old girl. All that information was in the presentence investigation report. There was no objection to the scoring of Offense Variable 13 because he admitted to the sexual assaults. There was it was never raised  \n I thought at page 36 of your brief that you agreed that he made a correct that there was an error in of application.\n Right. The Offense Variable 9 was there was an error with respect to that, but it wouldn't affect the ultimate position he would be placed in the in the brackets. In fact, the only error that did occur that would have affected the scoring was one in his favor, which would have put him put him in a higher bracket. So he in fact  \n So there were at least two errors. How they balance out I guess is your view they didn't hurt him at all.\n Well, in fact, if anything, helped him. But on a more basic level  \n Is that correct? There were two errors in the  \n Yes.\n at least.\n Yes.\n And he contends there were two more, and that hasn't been resolved.\n That's that's right, but I I think those claims are  \n So at at least we have to assume that it was not an error-free sentencing proceeding.\n Yes. Well, more importantly, the kinds of issues at play for the sentencing cases are all like this. They they relate to the minimum sentencing. Michigan systems then determine from a maximum from a minimum to a maximum which will get a a range of time. All the these sentencing guideline cases relate to the minimum sentence. For Mr. Halbert as a sex offender, this is really a question about when he will be eligible for release from the Department of Corrections. He's going to be facing 30 years because all the sentences in Michigan are set by the statute. So these oral arguments relating lesser liberty  \n May I ask another question? Am I correct in assuming from the order entered on page 43 of the joint appendix that even though there were lots of errors there, the fact that they were not raised until after December 11th would have precluded review at the trial court level?\n No. His the point of the trial court there was that the defendant, if he wanted to withdraw his plea, should have raised that before the sentencing itself because the court has discretion before sentencing to let him out of his plea. After sentencing, he has to show that the plea was invalid. So his time he was untimely trying to withdraw his plea because he was concerned about consecutive as against concurrent sentences. In in summary, the the Michigan system the with the limited date to the review and the kinds of issues from plea-based convictions that are at issue are not are lesser liberty interest questions because they have to do with amount of punishment. The Michigan system extends the relationship of trial counsel to the defendant and asks the trial counsel to raise the motions regarding post-conviction motions which will enable him to have a factual record from which to advance his claims. He's not left to shift for himself, that there is a counsel appointed to identify those meritorious claims  \n But if the counsel happens to be incompetent, that's the end of the ball game.\n And that's always the circumstance for a defendant who's bringing a discretionary application where his prior counsel was ineffective, that he can be left to identify the meritorious claims on his own and to make the argument of ineffective assistance of counsel. That's true in Ross as well where your first where your first appeal as of right, your your appellate counsel is incompetent. You're going to be left to identify those meritorious claims, raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, and to try to avoid procedural bars that you'll be facing. Every system is going to have to draw that line and to say that at some point you're not going to get appointed another attorney. Just because there's access to the system doesn't mean there always has to be another attorney appointed. Otherwise, the point is that you would have to have two attorneys make a review on your case, whereas there is no right to an appeal here that this Court has recognized that ultimately where there since there is no right to appeal, that he had an opportunity to have a trial counsel  \n But, of course, if he had had paid counsel, he would not have had these handicaps.\n That's right, that the there is some advantage, but that's not the ultimate answer.\n Competent paid counsel.\n Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Restuccia. Mr. Schaerr, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Like the Sixth Circuit's invalidation of this Michigan statute in the Tesmer case, petitioner's attempt to invalidate that statute here runs counter to this Court's longstanding tradition of deference to the people of the individual States and to their legislatures in the design and implementation of their criminal justice systems. As the Court said in Coleman v. Thompson, a case like this is a case about federalism because it involves the respect that Federal courts must pay to States and the States' procedural rules. Respect for the State's choices is especially important here because, as the Court put it in Medina v. California, preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government. And therefore, the Court said we should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States. And and as to the question of of when to provide State-paid counsel, as Justice O'Connor reminded us in Murray v. Giarratano, that's a choice that should be one of legislative choice, especially since it involves difficult policy considerations and the allocation of scarce legal resources.\n Now, I take it that the basic rule that we've followed and this is what people are arguing about could be a criminal trial or proceeding, plea, something in a trial court.\n Right.\n It emerges with a judgment, and then there is going to be the first review. Call it a leave to appeal, call it an appeal, call it whatever you want, but it is the first review. And in those two instances, State, if the defendant is poor, give him a lawyer. That's simple. That's clear. Everybody could understand it. They may not even have a lot of legal arguments. Now, what significant what does that prevent a State from doing that it's reasonably important for a State to want to do?\n Well, again, Justice Breyer, it's a question of allocating scarce legal resources. If you and this case is a perfect example of that. This case is not does not involve an appeal as of right. It involves a discretionary appeal, and and that's the vast bulk of of appeals that are addressed by the by the Michigan Court of Appeals. So if you impose here on the State of Michigan an obligation to provide counsel in all of those cases, you are, in essence, forcing the people of Michigan to reallocate their legal resources away from other cases or you're requiring the legislature to increase taxes to pay for that to pay for that  \n Is there any other State that's done it the way Michigan has?\n I don't believe there's another State that's done it exactly the same way. But I but I would point out and I think this is important, Justice Breyer that that at least according to the Michigan Supreme Court in the Bulger case, the majority of States don't allow any appeal at all from a plea-based conviction. 21 of them rule it out entirely and expressly, and another 17 effectively rule out appeals from plea-based convictions by by allowing prosecutors to impose that impose a waiver as a condition of entering into a plea. So so the relevant universe for comparison is quite small here. It's really 12 States at most, and and Michigan sort of fits within the middle of those States in terms of the amount of resources that it provides and opportunities that it provides.\n Are you saying I just want to be clear that even if this defendant had had paid counsel, he would not have had any right to appeal to the intermediate court?\n That's correct. It it's discretionary, and that's clear not just not just from analysis of the of the Michigan courts' opinions, but from the provision of the of but from the constitutional provision that that created this entire controversy, which was added in 1994. It's article I, section 20. And that constitutional provision itself draws a sharp distinction between appeals of right and appeals by leave of court. So even if the Michigan courts wanted to have a system of of mandatory appeals, they're now precluded by the Michigan constitution from doing that. And so and so clearly, if this Court adheres to the sharp distinction and which I think is equally sharp and clear, that this Court has made between between appeals of right and discretionary appeals  \n But it's not that it's not that sharp because it was in Ross, it was the second appeal. So here we have one factor that is like Douglas, Griffin, and one factor that's like Ross. You can't say that it falls in one camp more than the other. This is the first-tier appeal.\n I I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but but that's not the distinction that I understand this Court's decisions draw. Several times since Douglas and Ross, this Court has said that the right to paid counsel addressed in Douglas extends only to the first appeal of right and no further. And that's that's Coleman and and Finley, among others.\n Of course, the question is whether the words, of right, were essential to that statement.\n I I'm assuming that the Court was being careful in its in its choice of words, and I believe it was because that that  \n Because then it wouldn't have needed to include the word first.\n I'm sorry?\n But then the word first was redundant, not the words, of right.\n No, I don't  \n You can have two appeals of right  \n That's right.\n I suppose if you wanted to.\n That's right. Now, so so the real question here, with regard to the right to paid counsel, is does it make sense to extend what the Court did in Douglas to this new situation. We think it does not. This Court's decisions, Ross and Justice Kennedy's concurrence in in Murray, as I recall, draw draw a distinction between the removal of barriers that the State imposes to the exercise of litigation rights on the one hand and, on the other hand, subsidizing, affirmatively subsidizing litigation rights And and I think this Court's care in distinguishing between appeals of right and discretionary appeals reflects a desire to cabin Douglas and and to avoid any further excursions into the area of subsidies. And we think that's a we think that's we think that's good as a matter of policy for the Court to do that, for one thing  \n May may I ask you one thing lest we forget it? Is is your argument premised on the assumption that a refusal to hear an appeal is is not regarded as a determination on the merits and thus preclusive?\n No, I don't think so. I I think that helps the argument. But in fact, there are lots of discretionary appeals or discretionary appellate proceedings that that do result in decisions on the merits. This Court, for example, sometimes summarily affirms or reverses on cert, and the fact that the Court does that doesn't create  \n Well, we accept cert before we do that. I thought the question was that the denial of an application for appeal does not have any merits consequence. Wasn't that the question?\n Yes, yes.\n Does the denial of an application for appeal have any merits consequence?\n Well, as if if that's the question, I I would defer to to Michigan counsel  \n No. But I'm asking whether that's a premise of your argument because the consequences of your argument are going to be very different depending on whether that is the premise or whether it isn't, whether that premise is true or whether it isn't.\n I I think the distinction is is not necessarily whether the decisions are on the merits or not. I think the distinction is between appeals of right and and appeals that are discretionary.\n If it's always on the merits, it's an it's an appeal of right, it seems to me. How can you have a a discretionary appeal which always decides the merits of the case?\n Well, I in in fact, I don't think that's what happens in Michigan, and and I think the  \n So your the assumption of your argument is that it is not on the merits. I.e., it is not a merits determination if there's a denial and hence there is no preclusion.\n I I think that's true. Whether it's an assumption of the argument, I'm not I'm not so sure.\n You're talking about a piece of paper, that first piece of paper saying to the appeals court, appeals court, please hear my appeal.\n Right.\n And then it lists a whole lot of reasons like a cert petition.\n Right.\n And those are likely to do with the merits of the case. I mean, they'll tell all the horrible things that went on. And the question is, is he going to have a lawyer to help him with that piece of paper or not?\n That's right.\n All right. Now now, it sounds to me just the kind of thing you'd write if you had an appeal on the merits too. No. It's even harder. Even harder. You've got to convince them to take it.\n It it is more difficult, but but the disparity between  \n So why draw that distinction? The piece of paper is the same, even harder to write, needs the lawyer as much, first chance he gets after the trial court. Why draw that distinction?\n Well, again, because because if you if you broaden the right to State-paid counsel, as as in Douglas, you're going to require States to to reallocate resources to that priority and away from other priorities. Also, if you if you subsidize litigation in the name of providing adequate access to courts or meaningful access to courts, then there's going to be a lot of litigation in the lower Federal courts about exactly how much of a subsidy is necessary to reach that standard. And also, if and this is particularly important here I think. If you require States to subsidize the exercise of a right that they're not required to provide in the first place, like the right to seek review of a of a plea-based conviction, then you give the States a strong incentive to cut back on or eliminate that right altogether. And and, you know, who knows? But perhaps that's what's going on in the in the trend in the States away from providing this right. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Schaerr. Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining.\n Thank you. I have to begin by correcting several misstatements of fact and of Michigan law. First of all, Mr. Schaerr just said that only a dozen States, I believe, allow for appeals from guilty pleas. That's not correct. Every State in the United States currently allows for appeals from guilty plea pleas. The Bulger case did say that. They cited a  \n Appeals as of right?\n Not necessarily. As I cited in my brief, a number of States allow for applications or petitions from guilty pleas, but every State has a first- tier direct appeal from guilty pleas. The Bulger the Michigan Supreme Court in Bulger cited a an article from an Arizona Attorney magazine that was simply incorrect on that. Secondly, on the issue of what is the effect of a order denying leave to appeal for lack of merit on the grounds presented, the State continues to rely on McKenzie v. Smith, an earlier Sixth Circuit opinion, People v. Berry, and Bobenal v. Saginaw Investment. None of those cases uses the phrase, lack of merit on the grounds presented. That phrase does not appear in any of those three cases. The Berry and the Bobenal cases, those are Michigan Court of Appeals cases before 1981. Beginning in 1981, in a series of three cases, People v. Douglas, People v. Hayden, and People v. Wiley, the Michigan Court of Appeals held unambiguously that our orders denying applications or remand orders, in that case, for lack of merit on the grounds presented, was law of the case.\n What's the effect of the constitutional provision then?\n I'm sorry? I I don't  \n If that's so, what is the effect of the constitutional provision that Mr. Schaerr read?\n The Michigan constitutional provision? It changes the way in which guilty plea appeals proceed. Before 1994, there were other types of appeals that had to proceed by application for leave to appeal, primarily late appeals. If the appeal was filed too late, it had to proceed by application for leave to appeal. In 1994, as a result of the constitutional amendment, guilt plea appeals now have to proceed by application for leave to appeal. That's constitutional. We have no problem with that, and that is the method by which the caseload management problems have been solved. They have been solved.\n I I you you have the wrong one. I meant the one that said that applications to the court of appeals are are require leave to appeal. What's the effect of that?\n The I assume you're still referring to article I, section 20 of the Michigan constitution.\n Yes. It says that for the court of appeals, you need leave to appeal. I thought they were doing something there. What were they doing?\n They were saying that first-tier felony appeals in Michigan following pleas require leave of the court, require an application for leave to appeal, like late appeals from trial cases do. But all of those appeals are still decided on the merits with preclusive effect for law of the case purposes. And the Sixth Circuit specifically dealt with that in in the Abela case. McKenzie v. Smith never never mentions anything about the lack of merit in the grounds presented. The resource allocations point is simply that not all of these guilty plea appeals are lead to full argument and full briefing, and that's fine. Michigan can do that. But what Michigan cannot do, as a result of Ellis and Douglas, is for that first gatekeeping part of the appeal, which is where the court has to decide is there merit in this case, to make the indigent shift for himself. And so in in Smith v. Robbins, this Court, specifically referring back to the Ellis case, said that the problem that the Court identified in Ellis and that became part of the constitutional minimum in Douglas, was that the old California procedure did not require I see my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n Thank you, Mr. Moran. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In this case, the Ninth Circuit violated AEDPA by reversing the California Supreme Court's decision affirming Payton's 1982 death sentence. The California Supreme Court applied the exact right case, namely Boyde v. California, in the very manner contemplated that by that decision when assessing Payton's claim that his jury misunderstood the court's instructions and, in particular, factor (k) so as to unconstitutionally preclude consideration of his mitigating evidence. The California Supreme Court's application of Boyde is precisely the type of good faith application of Federal constitutional law to which AEDPA demands deference. It is manifestly not objectively unreasonable, and this can be demonstrated in three aspects of the decision. The first is that the California Supreme Court recognized Boyde's specific holding that factor (k) facially comported with the Eighth Amendment. The second is  \n Well, I thought the holding was that factor (k), standing alone, does does not raise a does does not, standing alone, raise a question of reasonable probability of of misunderstanding or misapplication of the law. And that's not what they're claiming here. They're claiming here that there was something much more than (k) standing alone. As I understand it, they're claiming that the difference between this and Boyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is that the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that was in fact wrong and and continued to do so even after the court interrupted the argument and that the court never gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous statements of law that the prosecutor had made. So that's that's why they're they're saying this is not a Boyde situation.\n Your Honor, Boyde has two specific components to its decision, which is, first, what factor (k) means standing alone, and you need to resolve that issue, which California did, in deciding the impact of the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k). So that, first, you start from the premise, as the California Supreme Court did, in following Boyde, that factor (k) facially directed for consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence.\n Well, no, no. The the mitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered without a (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence about the the character of the individual prior to or at least up to the moment of the crime. So this is this is different kind of evidence, and I I mean, this is post-crime evidence. And and I don't see that that Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover this at all. It might be a it would be a a closer question if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument and the judge's failure to correct it. But even even without those elements, there would be a serious question whether Boyde covered this at all.\n Your Honor, the respectfully I disagree. I believe that the California Supreme Court correctly and and reasonably determined that Boyde's holding encompassed Payton's character mitigating Payton's mitigating character evidence because the holding in Boyde or the issue directly presented by Boyde was whether factor (k) limited consideration to circumstances related to the crime or allowed for non-crime related mitigating evidence in deciding the appropriate penalty.\n What do we make of the Chief Justice's clear statement, not once but twice, in Boyde? The prosecutor never suggested that background and character evidence could not be considered. So mustn't we take Boyde with that qualification when we have a case where the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this information could not be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor?\n No, Justice Ginsburg. First, you must assess factor (k) facially and that's what Boyde did. Then the next question is did the prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k) mislead the jury to believe that they could no longer consider Payton's mitigating character evidence. And that would be the second component of Boyde which is a general test for assessing the reasonable likelihood a jury misunderstood the instructions in the context of the proceedings. And the particularly relevant and important inquiry in this case is the California Supreme Court's application of Boyde's reasonable likelihood test in the context of the proceedings.\n Well, do we take do we take the case on the assumption that the trial court erred in not giving a curative instruction and in saying, well, this is a matter for the attorneys to argue? You you don't argue about what a statute means. That's a question of law. You don't argue that. You can argue the facts, that it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's extenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you can interpret a lot of this. But it it seems to me that the trial judge does make a mistake when he says, well, well, this is for the this is for them to argue when the the point of the objection was that there was a misinterpretation of the instruction. That's a legal point.\n And that is a fact that was expressly considered by the California Supreme Court in appropriately applying Boyde's general test for whether the jury misunderstood the court's instructions and an instruction that facially called for consideration  \n Not that that the jury misunderstood the judge's instruction, that there was no instruction. I mean, the the picture that's given here is the defense attorney says, I can use this to mitigate. The prosecutor says this is not legitimate mitigating evidence, and he said that several times. And the judge said, well, you can both argue it, and the judge never instructed the jury. He left it to the prosecutors to argue the law to the jury and for the jury to make that legal determination. It it seems to me that that that is surely an error. Now, you could still say, well, even so, it was harmless. But but I don't think can there be any doubt when the judge tells the attorneys, you argue the law to the jury and let the jury decide what the law is?\n Yes. There there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not take the prosecutor's statements so as to preclude consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence because the prosecutor's statements cannot  \n Well, even even if even if that's argument is is on point, just taking your your response on its own terms, where do you get a reasonable likelihood?\n Because the prosecutor's statements cannot be construed in a vacuum. You have to look, as Boyde required and as California did, at the context of the entire proceedings. What we're here what the jury was doing in Payton was deciding whether Payton should live or die, the sentencing determination.\n Well, but let's get specific. You you said there isn't a reasonable possibility. Why? Get get down to facts. Why isn't there a reasonable possibility?\n Why there is not a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood?\n Yes. The prosecutor stands there and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and after the judge interrupts him says, you cannot legally consider this evidence. It does not fall within (k), and the judge never corrects it. Why is there not a a reasonable likelihood of of jury mistake?\n One, Your Honor, the judge admonished the jury that the prosecutor's statements were that of an advocate, and that  \n No. Precisely, if I recall and you correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the judge said was that the prosecutor's statements were were not evidence. Of course, they're not evidence. The issue isn't whether they were evidence. They were statements of the law. The judge didn't say anything about whether they were correct or incorrect statements of the law. It seems to me that the judge's response to the objection was totally beside the point.\n The nevertheless, the judge's response relegated the prosecutor's statements as to his personal opinion as to that of a some as as of of to argument, which is a statement of an advocate. And the jury, from the time it was empanelled, guilt phase, and through the penalty phase, and at the concluding instructions was repeatedly instructed that they would be getting the instruction on the law from the court. And here  \n And the court didn't give them an instruction on this contested point.\n I respectfully disagree.\n He didn't come out and say, yes, you can consider this under (k). He never said that.\n No, but (k) says you can consider it under (k).\n (k) says you can consider evidence that that goes to the gravity of the crime. I will be candid to say I think you're stretching things about as far as you can stretch, as Boyde held, that that character evidence pre and up to the time of the crime can be considered reasonably under that factor. But certainly evidence of what an individual did after the crime is committed does not naturally follow within (k) at all, and I don't know why any juror would consider it unless a judge came out and said flatly you can.\n Your Honor, the California Supreme Court reasonably applied Boyde's holding, that factor (k) did call for consideration of character evidence, and that's precisely what Payton presented  \n Well, what if we conclude that there was an error here? Is there a harmless error argument that you fall back on?\n Yes, Your Honor, there is a harmless error, but before we even get to harmless error, the fact that you disagree with the ultimate conclusion of the California Supreme Court under AEDPA is not sufficient.\n May I ask  \n The California Supreme Court's decision  \n May I ask a question that goes sort of to the beginning? What is your position on whether or not the prosecutor correctly stated the law?\n The State concedes, and as the California Supreme Court recognized, the prosecutor misstated the law, but the jury would not  \n Do you also concede he did so deliberately? Do you concede there was prosecutorial misconduct is what I'm really asking.\n Absolutely not, Your Honor. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct. The prosecutor made a mistake, and the misconduct analysis, which is similar to what Boyde contemplated when they set forth the general standard for assessing whether a jury would misunderstood misunderstand an instruction is is almost the same when when you're analyzing whether the question is prosecutorial misconduct. Boyde sets forth the test for how to assess a misstatement by the prosecutor, and Boyde said that at the first instance, a statement of the prosecutor is not to be considered as having the same force as instructions from the court. And that principle was recognized by the California Supreme Court and reinforced  \n That that statement went to whether the jury was apt to accept it, not to the question of whether the prosecutor acted improperly.\n I'm sorry, Your Honor. The in this case, the prosecutor made a mistake. I don't think that there's any evidence to support the conclusion that the prosecutor committed misconduct in this case, particularly  \n Well, I I can see that a a prosecutor could say, you know, this isn't factor (k) evidence, as a way of saying that this evidence is of little weight. He did say at at one at one time, you have not heard any legal evidence of mitigation, and and that that's the troublesome part.\n Your Honor, the the State concedes that the the prosecutor did make misstatements, but I think that the bulk as you pointed out, the bulk of the prosecutor's argument went to the weight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence, and actually most of the argument by the prosecutor indicating that Payton's evidence didn't mitigate the seriousness of his rape and murder is there were similar arguments that were made by the prosecutor in Boyde and which Boyde found were not objectionable. But again, the important scrutiny is that the California Supreme Court evaluated the prosecutor's statements within the correct analytical framework matrix established by Boyde. They considered all the correct principles, the the effect of argument of counsel. They considered the instructions, and like Boyde, they found that factor (k) facially directed the consideration  \n Suppose suppose I were to take the view that it is a violation of clearly established law for a court to allow a prosecutor repeatedly to misstate the law, misinform the jury about what the law is on a life or death question without correcting that misstatement, without saying to the jury, jury, it's not for the prosecutor to argue what the law is. I tell you what the law. If the judge doesn't do that, then that meets any standard of violating clearly established law about which there should be no doubt that when the prosecutor makes a misstatement on a life or death question, it is the judge's obligation to say, jury, he is wrong. You take your instruction from me and here's my instruction. Suppose that's my view of this case. I don't Boyde and all these other cases it just strikes me that that's clearly wrong. What do I do with that?\n Well, you can find that the court was wrong and not like what you did what the court did, but the inquiry is whether the jury misunderstood the instructions as a result of the court's conduct. And that requires an analysis of the context of the proceedings, and that is precisely what the California Supreme Court did. They  \n Well, now you're getting to the question I think that Justice O'Connor raised a few minutes ago about are you urging, yes, this is error, but it was harmless?\n No, I am not agreeing that this was error at all. I agree that the prosecutor made a misstatement and that the California Supreme Court thoroughly and properly evaluated that statement  \n Well, but just on that point, if the prosecutor makes a misstatement, doesn't the trial judge have an obligation to correct it if it's significant?\n The in this case  \n Or am I wrong? Or am I wrong about that? The judge just kind of watches the ship sail over the waterfall?\n The I mean, the the trial court did correct it. It may not be the sufficient correction in this Court's eye, but the court did give an admonition that relegated the prosecutor's statements to that of the advocate and not to the instructions of the court.\n Well, what if the prosecutor had said several times to the jury during the course of his arguments that the burden of proof by the State is by a preponderance, not beyond a reasonable doubt? And the judge just says the prosecutor's arguments are just that, they're not the law. I'll instruct you. But he never says anything. Is that okay?\n It's not what we'd optimally want the court to do, but that's not the inquiry that's presented and answered by Boyde. The question is as a result of what happened. Trials are not error-free. We wish that they were, but they're not. The question is how do you respond to when a when a prosecutor makes a misstatement of law. And Boyde addresses that question. Boyde  \n Well, normally we would think the trial judge would correct a misstatement of the law by counsel. We would normally think that, wouldn't we?\n Yes.\n And it wasn't clearly done here. I mean, the the jury was reminded that arguments of counsel are just that. But there was no attempt to correct what appeared to be a misstatement.\n The court's admonition was sufficient. But we're we we have to respond to the case that's before you.\n What what admonition was sufficient? The court said something about evidence and everybody I mean, there's no question what the prosecutor said isn't evidence. But he didn't tell them he has misstated the law. We're not talking about evidence is not at issue at all. Neither side suggests that it is. It's a question is what is the law that governs this controversy, what is the law that the jury must apply to make a life or death decision.\n Right, and what was  \n And and you  \n Sorry.\n you said the judge corrected it, and I read this joint appendix. I could not find any correction.\n The court's admonition that the prosecutor's argument was not evidence but argument of counsel relegated the statements of the prosecutor to that of an advocate and did not take the prosecutor's arguments and elevate it in place of the instructions given  \n Then then it then it has another problem with it because then the judge is saying that's an argument. Jury, you've heard arguments on both sides. You decide. But it isn't for the jury to decide what the law is.\n But the analysis is whether there was a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood the court's instructions so as to preclude consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence, and that  \n Did the judge instruct the jury that you are to consider all of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial?\n Yes, Your Honor, and actually that's one of the inquiries that Boyde required, is that you look at the instruction itself, the other instructions, and that's an inquiry the California Supreme Court did, in fact, conduct. And that is, the jury was presented with with a instruction that said, you shall consider all the evidence unless otherwise instructed, and nothing out of any of the factors (a) through (k) limited the jury's consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence or precluded pardon me  \n Oh, are you taking the position that as a matter of California procedure, the jury was entitled to consider matters that matter that was not within (a) through (k)?\n I think that the instructions encompass the jury considering something not specifically in (a) through (k) for purposes of mitigating evidence because the instructions say, you shall consider the evidence presented, and that was Payton's evidence  \n Have the California courts said that?\n That?\n Have the California courts said that (a) through (k) are is not intended to be exhaustive at the pre-Payton pardon me. Yes. Have they said that pre-Payton?\n I don't think that that issue has been presented and decided by the California Supreme Court specifically  \n I I thought the case was being argued to us correct me if I'm wrong on on the theory that this was factor (k) evidence.\n It is our position that it it does fall within factor (k) evidence, but in deciding whether the whether Payton's jury was unconstitutionally precluded from considering the evidence, you look to the all the instructions. And when you consider the direction to consider all that you shall consider all the evidence and then the concluding instruction  \n But Ms. Cortina, the the red brief maybe it's not accurate. They say the instruction was all the evidence received during any part of the trial in this case, except as you may hereafter be instructed, and then that followed what the factor (k) discussion came after that. So would it not have been possible that the jury would have thought except for the following things? Or is there something more that I missed?\n No. The written instruction followed the arguments of counsels. And what and so no, there was no instruction after that.\n So if they misunderstood the factor (k) instruction, they would have thought they could not consider all the evidence.\n There was no reasonable likelihood that they felt that they could not consider Payton's evidence under factor (k), and the California Supreme Court  \n Well, if they believed the prosecutor, they would have thought they couldn't.\n But there but as analyzed by the California Supreme Court, it is not reasonably likely that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements. And as I was saying, to do so, the jury would have had to  \n But all all I'm directing my inquiry to is to the significance of the instruction to consider all the evidence. I think it's they could consider all the evidence, except that which may not be admissible, as I now or may not be relevant as I shall hereafter instruct you.\n However, nothing in the following instruction says you shall not consider Payton's mitigating evidence.\n No, but the prosecutor said that if you interpret the last instruction properly, you shall not do so.\n He said that it didn't fall within factor (k). However, the the jury would there is no reasonable likelihood and the California Supreme Court was not objectively unreasonable, including in concluding that the that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first few misstatements and chosen to disregard Payton's mitigating evidence because the jury just sat through eight witnesses testifying to Payton's post-crime remorse and rehabilitation. They sat through that without any misstatements by the prosecutor. So they recognized that they had heard this evidence and that it was relevant and that it was subject to consideration. Then they heard the arguments of counsel concerning the weight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence. And although the prosecutor did make the misstatements, his statements were relegated to that of an advocate. And to conclude that the jury would disregard the repeated instructions to follow the to take the law from the court and their inevitable, long-held societal beliefs that remorse and rehabilitation are relevant to making an appropriate moral reasoned response in deciding the life or death sentence is not a reasonable conclusion. And we know that the fact in fact, that the jury did consider Payton's mitigating evidence by virtue of the questions that the juries the jury asked the court during deliberations. The jury asked whether Payton would be eligible for parole and whether any change in the law could retroactively make him eligible for parole. You only get to a consideration of whether what the effect is of saving Payton's life, under the California sentencing scheme that was existed at that time, if you believe that there's mitigation evidence to consider because California, at the time of Payton's sentencing, instructed the jury that if the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you shall impose death. Their  \n They they might not have thought that the aggravating circumstances were entitled to to great weight. I mean, we don't know how they evaluated the aggravating circumstances.\n That might be one reasonable conclusion, but the other reasonable conclusion  \n But I mean, that that is a possible conclusion, and therefore, it doesn't follow from the fact that they raised the question about life without parole that they necessarily had found that they were necessarily considering the mitigating evidence.\n It's a reasonable inference to be made from the questions asked, and that's what you're looking at.\n It's it's one possibility. Isn't that all?\n It's one reasonable inference, and that's what's the important inquiry, is that the trial the California Supreme Court reasonably considered the relevant, pertinent facts and all the applicable law in reaching a decision that Payton's jury was not unconstitutionally precluded from considering his mitigating character evidence. And I think that that the California Supreme Court's decision demonstrates that it applied Boyde to the letter faithfully and methodically, and that it it considered all the relevant facts and that its decision under these circumstances is manifestly not objectively unreasonable. And that is the requirement, and that is the inquiry that we're here today to resolve. The the Ninth Circuit failed to give the appropriate deference to the California Supreme Court's decision in deciding that the penalty should be Payton's penalty should be reversed. And the Ninth Circuit instead conflated objectively unreasonable with a determination that it personally felt that there was constitutional error and doesn't respect the distinction recognized in AEDPA between a incorrect decision or a correct decision, incorrect decision, unreasonable decision, and the higher threshold of objectively unreasonable. And unless this Court has any further questions, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n How long did the penalty phase take?\n The penalty phase took about a day with eight witnesses.\n Thank you. Mr. Gits.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start off, if I may, by addressing some of the points that were brought up just earlier, and I'd like to indicate to this Court that the California Supreme Court has held that factors (a) through (k) are the exclusive considerations that the jury must encompass in deciding whether or not to impose death or life.\n Has factor (k) been supplemented with a CALJIC instruction since Payton?\n It has. In 1983, 2 years after Payton's trial, it was supplemented to include all of the mitigating evidence that this Court has indicated the jury is entitled to consider. But what is important  \n Excuse me. Do they still call it factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental instruction that follows factor (k)?\n It's been a couple of years since I've done a death penalty trial, but I think it's still called factor (k). It's just supplemented and changed that way. The second thing is that this Court has indicated some concern over the jury question that was raised first in in the State's reply argument. And I need to put the Court, I think, in in proper context as to what occurred in in that jury question. The case was given to the jury at 11:55 on the date of of the determination, and the jury was told to select a foreman. 5 minutes they went into the deliberations room. 5 minutes later they came out and went to lunch. They didn't commence their deliberations thereafter until 1 o'clock. At 1:10, they came out with a the question that is now before the Court. And I want to suggest to this Court that it is not reasonable to believe that during that 10-minute span of time the jury considered the whether or not factor (k) applied.\n And what was the question?\n The question there were really two questions. One and I'm paraphrasing is there any possibility Mr. Payton could be released on parole if we give him life, and the second one is if the law is amended, could that be construed to be retroactively applicable to Mr. Payton. Those were the two questions.\n Those don't sound as if they thought his conversion to Christianity made a difference.\n I think, Your Honor, what the jury articulated is what this Court has seen on many occasions, the jury's concern about does life without possibility mean life without.\n Yes.\n They never went beyond that at this point in time. So what I'm suggesting to this Court is that the short span that they had to write that question, which I agree, given enough time, might permit an inference that they did consider factor (k), isn't applicable in this case.\n Well, an equal inference is they just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all given the horrific nature of this of this crime.\n Yes, I agree. And my position isn't that that the short span of you know, assists our position. Our position is that this won't assist this Court in arriving at a decision about whether the jury considered it.\n And you have to show there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an opposite conclusion.\n Yes. And Boyde teaches that the way to do that is to look at the context of the entire case in conjunction with the the instruction that was given in this case. And I want to start out that I I agree with the State that the first thing this Court should do is look at the instruction standing alone. And I want to indicate that without reference to the context of the case, the instruction standing alone does not support the inference that Payton's post-crime evidence could be considered. Now, I agree that in the context of the case, the context of the case could change that consideration. For instance, if the court, as this some member of this Court already indicated, told the jury that factor (k) is to encompass Payton's evidence, or even if the prosecutor may have said to the jury during his argument, ladies and gentlemen, although it might not seem like Payton's evidence could be considered by you under factor (k), in fact it can, then we would be left with a situation very similar to Boyde where there really is no argument among counsel as to whether or not the evidence could be subsumed under (k). And that, in the context of that case, would permit it.\n Well, on on that point and I I recognize it's it's not nearly as clean as the hypothetical you present he did say this is the prosecutor. The law in its simplicity is that if the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the sentence should be death, and so let's just line these up, and then he talks about the the conversion. So there were other parts of his argument that indicated by one interpretation this is not mitigating under special (k) under factor (k). But here he does say that you line that up and you weigh one against the other.\n I I would respond to that by saying two things. He does say that, but after he says, ladies and gentlemen, I want to address some of of Payton's evidence. I'm not suggesting and I'm and I don't believe that it applies under factor (k). But then he went on to discuss that evidence. And I agree he did. I certainly can't say he didn't. But but the real issue here is what effect likely did that have on the jury, and I I'm indicating that that given the preliminary his preliminary part about it still doesn't apply but I will address it, that is unlikely to give the jury any confidence that that evidence could be considered. So it's not at all a concession that occurred in this case whatsoever.\n Well, why wouldn't the jury conclude why isn't it the most logical conclusion that, gee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and listen to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it, so of course we must consider it because otherwise we wouldn't have been exposed to all of it?\n That was a relevant consideration in Boyde and I think a powerful consideration in Boyde and in California v. Brown. Because of the context of this case, it's not relevant here. Once the judge permits both counsel one counsel to argue one way and the other counsel to argue the other way, the jury is now being relegated as the the finder of the law. In order to evaluate whether or not they could consider that evidence, they had to look at the evidence that was presented.\n Well, they they always have to say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or is it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying, well, this really isn't mitigating. And we know as lawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is that is relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it the weight that it chooses. But jurors say, well, you know, this this just is not important is what they're saying.\n Well, when the prosecutor says this doesn't fall under (k) and the defense attorney says it does fall under (k), all I'm indicating is that the argument that this would be viewed as a charade no longer has any effect. It is now a preliminary thing that the court that the jury must look to.\n Well, it's a shorthand for saying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so little weight. Now, that's I think how the jury might have interpreted it.\n Yes, Your Honor, they might. But the issue here is whether or not there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not consider that, and and that's  \n Actually that isn't really the issue. I think I find that easy. The harder issue is is whether the a person who thought about it differently than me, a judge, would have be objectively unreasonable. At least for me, that's the hard question. The question you're arguing is not hard.\n Yes. I don't think I understand Your Honor.\n I mean, I would perhaps have come to a different conclusion than California Supreme Court on that question, but we can overturn them only if they're objectively unreasonable. And that's that's the hard thing because for me.\n Yes. I there is very relatively little guidance that we have so far on the AEDPA. I think the the cases that do have some relevance are both Wiggins v. Smith and Taylor v. Williams. Wiggins v. Smith dealt with the failure of the State court to actually evaluate evidence that occurred in this case. The California Supreme Court opinion on the issue of whether or not the the court properly conducted itself has one sentence, and the sentence says and I'm paraphrasing something to the effect of the fact that the court refused to adorn factor (k) is not in itself a an error. Well, we all, I think, would would concur that that's true, but that doesn't address what happened here. It's a complete failure to address an all-encompassing event that happened, something close and I have to be careful here something close to structural error where the judge gives over the obligation to decide what the law is to the jury. The California Supreme Court not once ever considered that, and there is no reference to them doing anything other than making that one  \n Well, no, but I mean, that's that's really wrong what the judge did. But but the that that's tangential to the question. The question is, is it reasonably likely, if that hadn't occurred, that the jury would have considered the evidence that he was converted? But since it did occur, you know, they they didn't consider it. Is it reasonably likely they never considered it? That's that's the question. And then I can imagine, for what reason that Justice Ginsburg said, myself sitting in the California Supreme Court and saying, well, they heard the evidence for 2 days or a day, six witnesses, eight witnesses. They're not technicians, the jury. And and of course, they considered it. I can imagine that and that's why I'm having even though I don't agree with it.\n Yes. Considered I agree. They certainly considered the evidence, but they also, if they were following their obligation under the law, they considered whether or not they were entitled to give that any weight under factor (k). That was the primary function that was given to them. So certainly they discussed the evidence, but then did they arrive did they go in that room and arrive at a decision that maybe we can't by law consider this evidence? And I think that's the focal point here and that's the thing this Court doesn't know what happened in that jury room.\n Except if they heard so much of the evidence, isn't it unlikely that the jury thought they couldn't consider what they heard?\n The more evidence they hear, the more likely it is I think that human beings are going to consider the evidence. The evidence the the penalty evidence took place over a 2-day period of time, but I want to indicate that it took place over two half-day periods of time, and that if you put the time together, I think it comes to around 70 pages, which should be substantially less than a half-day altogether. Now, it encompassed eight witnesses, and there was a lot of evidence brought out about post-crime conduct. But it it wasn't a massive amount such as there was in Boyde, 400 pages and weeks of testimony. So I think that that's a a an important consideration too. The the Court's concern about whether or not the jury would likely consider that, it seems to me, starts with the an examination of of factor (k) itself. And and I want to indicate that Mr. Payton really didn't start out at the same mark as as the State did in its case. The language of factor (k) just doesn't on its face appear to permit consideration of that evidence. And and so, therefore, something had to have happened in the trial, we assert, to change that, to make the ambiguous, at least as applied to Payton, evidence of factor (k) applicable so that the jury would reasonably likely consider it. The events that could have happened during the context of that trial didn't happen. In fact, everything happened against the defendant. He starts off with an instruction that's against him that supports, under any natural reading, the prosecutor's language, and then he's buttressed with a prosecutor that given the plain and natural meaning of the language, is going to have a far more compelling position with the jury about whether or not it could be considered. And the and the defense attorney's position is really nothing more than an assertion, when he looks at the language itself an assertion that it was awkwardly worded. Now now, the defense attorney made reference to if this was the kind of evidence if I was a juror and I was considering this, I would think this would be important evidence. And the answer to that is of course, it is important evidence, but that's not the question. The question is whether or not it could be considered under (k). He gives he, the defense attorney, gives his position that that (k) was meant to be a catchall factor and it was meant to consume and take into effect Payton's evidence, but he had nothing to support that. He had no legal position to support it. He was faced with the plain language of the statute that didn't permit him to do that.\n Doesn't it? I mean, it it says that what's what's the exact language of that statute? I just had it here. It's it's gravity. It's the  \n It is any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime.\n Of the crime. You could say it. Yes, his his later conversion extenuated the gravity of the crime, not the not the when I try to think of this person, who is not me, thinking of that, I say, well, plausible. Plausible, not perhaps the best, but plausible, isn't it?\n Well, as we pointed out in our brief, this Court in in Skipper some Justices in in that decision indicated that well, in fact, the majority indicated that the post-crime evidence of rehabilitation in prison is, in fact, not anything that relates to culpability. Factor (k), however way you look at it and I agree that it's sufficiently ambiguous to where, given the right context, the right events happening at trial, a jury would reasonably likely look at it as covering that. But not under this case, though, because there wasn't anything that happened in Payton's trial which permitted a reasonable inference that in fact that evidence should be considered. And as to harmless error, I as we pointed out in our brief, it under the California statute, which in effect requires that if the aggravating evidence outweighs the mitigating evidence, the jury shall return a verdict of death, if there's no reasonable likelihood that the jury considered factor (k), then in effect Bill Payton was left without any mitigating evidence to be considered by the jury at all. And that means that the jury had to come back with a verdict of death. Now, that brings this Court, once the Court if the Court becomes satisfied as to constitutional error, that brings the Court, I think, very closely to to this case this Court's case in Penry v. Johnson because there the jury will not have had a vehicle in order to give effect to Payton's mitigating evidence. In Penry v. Johnson, in fact, in discussing at least the Eighth Amendment issue, this Court never really even discussed harmless error. It was reversed without any discussion. Now, I don't want to suggest the Court didn't engage in a harmless error  \n I I see where you're going, and I I see that there's some parallel. The problem in Penry was that the jury the jurors had to actually violate their instructions, and you have to escalate your argument a bit before you get to that point.\n Yes, I I agree. It's not exactly identical, but we're very close to to that point in Penry. Beyond that, the prosecutor did argue vociferously that the jury should in its determination, should be concerned about whether or not Bill Payton is going to stab the prison guards in the back, in effect, argued dangerousness, which was appropriate. But if the jury he also argued that the jury couldn't consider evidence which plainly pointed to his lack of dangerousness, his good adjustment in prison, his conversion to Christianity. So, in effect, the prosecutor was able to argue its side and and the jury wasn't able, when you get to the harmless error analysis, to argue its side. And that's what makes this, it seems to me, a very strong showing that that harmless error that the error in this case is not harmless. It had a clearly important effect.\n Is it relevant at all? This happened 24 years ago. We're sitting here trying to think of what a jury would have been thinking in a state of the law that's a quarter of a century old and facts I don't know what to think. I guess that's just irrelevant?\n Well, it's certainly relevant to Bill Payton, and and I don't demean the position of the Court. It's not relevant in terms of its impact as to future cases. There are some cases left that are still dealing out there, dealing with factor (k). The best our knowledge, we've we've done a search and we believe there is about 70 cases dealing with the old, unadorned factor (k), but of those 70 cases, none of them from and we haven't reviewed all of them, but of the ones we've reviewed, none of them deal both with Payton's pure post-crime evidence, coupled with the prosecutor's unrelenting position to the Government that they cannot consider that evidence.\n So all this was at a time before Penry was decided.\n It is the time before Penry v. Johnson was decided.\n Yes.\n It is not the time before Penry v. Lynaugh was decided. And when I say  \n Which is the Texas the Texas you know, the ones  \n Both are the Texas case. Both deal with Mr. Penry.\n Yes, one and two.\n Yes.\n Is that  \n Yes. And when I say it was not before that, I'm talking about on the date of the California Supreme Court's decision. At the time of the jury determination, this Court only had or that court only had Lockett to make a determination as to whether the evidence could be could be considered. And the court made the decision that he thought the it could be considered, but then refused to make any adjustments once it became clear that both counsel were going to argue their respective positions on the law. The the Court earlier talked about other instructions as impacting upon the the context of the case, and those were important considerations in Boyde, especially the observation that the jury was to consider any other evidence presented at either time in the trial. But in the context of this case, Your Honor, it means nothing. As I've indicated, the jury was required to ignore any evidence it heard at either phase of the trial unless it fit within factors (a) through (k). If it didn't fit within there, even though they heard that evidence, they were instructed to ignore it. Beyond that, they were also instructed that the that they were to consider the arguments of counsel. Now, being that there was no clear instruction to the jury that they had to consider factor (k) as being relevant evidence, the jury then likely put greater weight on counsel's argument, and that's why it becomes important. So the other instructions, when you put them all together, rather than putting in proper context what did occur in this case, in effect make it even harder for Bill Payton's position that the jury should consider factor (k) to be relevant.\n The the prosecutor, at the very end of his closing to the jury, did seem, even if grudgingly with it, to recognize that that this evidence was mitigating. I'm looking at page 76 of the joint appendix at the top of the page. He makes the statement, the law is simple. It says aggravating factors outweigh mitigating, and then how do those factors line up? Well, the facts of the case showing the violence, et cetera that's on the aggravating side. And then against that, defendant really has nothing except newborn Christianity and the fact that he's 28 years old. So that in that final word to the jury, the prosecutor seems to be saying, yes, they have mitigating factors, but they're insubstantial, 28 years old and the claim that he's a newborn Christian.\n It'll be up to this Court to make a determination as to where the prosecutor was going and whether or not this constitutes a concession that that the jury could consider the evidence. I our position is that viewed as a whole, he did not go to that. Certainly he permitted the jury, and he did address the issue of if the jury does consider that. He premised it by saying, I don't think this is relevant, but if and I'm paraphrasing here. But if you think it's relevant, it's still not entitled to weight. If the issue before this Court is whether or not there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury considered that evidence, then given the context of that statement, I don't think the jury can hardly be satisfied that the prosecutor in fact gave in and agreed that Payton's evidence  \n Do do we have a transcript of that hearing here?\n Of what hearing, Your Honor?\n Well, the penalty phase. I mean  \n Yes.\n one way if I'm having trouble, I'll just read it.\n It is in the in the joint appendix, the entire  \n The whole thing.\n Yes, the entire penalty evidence and all argument and the instructions is in there. And that's unless the Court has any additional questions, I have nothing further. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Gits. Ms. Cortina, you have a little over 5 minutes left.\n Justice Stevens, the real inquiry is whether the California Supreme Court's decision was objectively unreasonable. It is not whether there was a reasonable likelihood. And Payton, like the Ninth Circuit Payton's counsel  \n Could you help me on that? I thought it was two steps. I thought the question is whether there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled, and then you have to ask whether it was unreasonable for the State supreme court to conclude that there was that reasonable likelihood. Or correct me if I'm wrong.\n That is one way of approaching the case, but I think under AEDPA, what you'd look at, which would be the more appropriate way, is how the California Supreme Court analyzed the claim and not first conduct a de novo review about whether there was a reasonable likelihood. I don't think that in the end that there's much difference  \n But you can't overturn it on habeas unless there's a reasonable likelihood.\n Right. That would be right. You would have to find that the you would have to find an error and one that was objectively and then the California Supreme Court objectively unreasonable in not finding the error. This is true. So obviously the reasonable likelihood test is a is a relevant inquiry, but it is not the inquiry. And I think that that that's what Payton's argument demonstrates and the Ninth Circuit's analysis demonstrates, is that they are effectively equating a decision that the California Supreme Court's conclusion was incorrect with their personal in their subjective opinion with a with the standard that the decision must be objectively unreasonable. And in this case, the California Supreme Court's decision was manifesting not objectively unreasonable. We know we we know that objectively unreasonable doesn't have a clear definition. We do have an example of what is objectively unreasonable, and that was cited in Payton's brief and that is a failure to consider particular facts or relevant law. And we know that that didn't occur in this case. The very argument and facts that Payton insists were not considered by the California Supreme Court in applying Boyde if not in the majority opinion are found within Justice Kennard's dissent. So we have no question that the California Supreme Court identified the correct case and the correct principles within the case and considered all the necessary facts. And that should make this decision subject to deference under AEDPA. This Court last term provided additional guidance on how to assess the range of reasonable judgment through the lens of AEDPA in Yarborough v. Alvarado. And one of the things that the Ninth Circuit and Payton's analysis keeps overlooking is the Boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k). And when you analyze the the range of reasonable judgment of the California Supreme Court concerning factor (k), the specific rule of factor (k), the the range of reasonable judgment was less. The California Supreme Court had little to no leeway to conclude otherwise. Boyde's holding is broad. Boyde held that factor (k) was a broad, catchall mitigation instruction that allowed for any other circumstance that counseled a sentence less than death and specifically found that background and character fell within the ambit of factor (k). And no decision of this Court or the California Supreme Court in analyzing character has ever drawn a distinction between post-crime and pre-crime character evidence  \n There's a footnote in Boyde that seems to draw that distinction.\n The footnote in Boyde actually supports more California's position that factor (k) encompasses any other circumstance that would counsel a sentence less than death as opposed to the Ninth Circuit and Payton's interpretation that factor (k) is limited to the crime. In both the first part of footnote 5, the the Chief Justice Rehnquist rejects the dissent's argument that the gravity of the crime focused the consideration to the circumstances of the crime. Rather, it allowed the jury to assess the seriousness of what the defendant has done in light of what's the appropriate punishment, and that involves a consideration of the defendant's background and character. And then the last part of footnote 5 expressly recognizes that factor (k) allows for consideration of good character evidence, and good character evidence is only relevant to a decision about whether the person should live or die, not to circumstances related to the crime. And good character evidence under Payton and the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of factor (k) would not and could not, whether it existed pre or post-crime, fall under the meaning of factor (k). So the footnote 5 actually bolsters the ultimate broad interpretation that the California Supreme Court adopted when it applied Boyde Boyde's specific holding concerning factor (k) to the analysis of Payton's claim. And although they did, in footnote 5, distinguish the fact that it did not involve post-crime evidence in mitigation, it didn't decide the question. It was simply noting a fact that distinguished the case from Skipper. And and AEDPA requires that we follow the holdings of the Court and not dicta. So when we start  \n Thank you, Ms. go ahead and make one more sentence.\n The California Supreme Court's decision was a reasonable application of Boyde and the Ninth Circuit's reversal of it is and this Court should  \n I think we understand you.\n Exactly. Thank you. (Laughter.)\n Thank you. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: For 124 years, as state power over alcohol has ebbed and flowed, one principle has remained virtually constant, that states may regulate alcohol by one set of rules, not by two. New York and Michigan consigned out of-state wine, and only out-of-state wine, to the three tier system for closing the market to thousands of small family-run wineries and their customers for the benefit of a liquor distributor oligopoly. Discrimination is the core concern of the Commerce Clause, and it sends a powerful signal that the state is engaged, not in legitimate regulation, but in economic protectionism. The states and the liquor distributors make a sweeping argument that this Court has consistently rejected, that the Twenty-First Amendment creates plenary state authority.\n Well, under your view, could the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New Jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New York wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?\n Yes, Justice Kennedy.\n So, under your view, the whole three-tier system has to go down?\n No, Justice Kennedy. So long as the state does not discriminate against out-of-state entities, it is free to, as this Court  \n Well, under my hypothetical. I don't know exactly how the way it works, you have to be a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer. Under your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to a New York retailer.\n That is or a challenge, as you ask the question, Justice Kennedy, could be mounted to that, under the same theory that we're advocating here. The state may have a different set of defenses that it doesn't have here. But  \n But so far as the rationale is the same.\n The  \n It seems to me that, under your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.\n It has to pass constitutional muster.\n And when you say there is no precedent I mean, I think a much more modest claim than you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot discriminate against out-of-state liquor i.e., the physical liquid which is really more modest and keeps the three-tier effect now, your that claim, that they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in Young's Market. I read the briefs in that case. The briefs presented that Court you could have written those briefs. And the difficulty for you is, it articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment. And this Court squarely rejected it.\n Your Honor, Young's Market the result in Young's Market was correct  \n The result, I understand, you could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.\n Exactly.\n Reading Justice Brandeis' opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his result.\n The the cases that followed Young's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a very sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment. The Court began trenching on that very broad view immediately in 1939.\n But why wasn't that broad view appropriate, given the difference between the language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words \"to the same extent and in the same manner,\" and the Webb Kenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty First Amendment, leaves out \"to the same extent and the same manner.\" It just says that \"alcoholic beverage so that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use therein, in violation of laws thereof.\" It doesn't say \"nondiscriminatory laws.\"\n Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the there was no need for the Webb-Kenyon Act to repeat the language of the Wilson Act. The Wilson Act dealt with the question of discrimination. The Webb-Kenyon Act dealt with questions that arose subsequent to the enactment of the Wilson Act. And as this Court has held in Craig versus  \n Well, maybe that's the Act, but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they adopt the language, \"to the same extent and in the same manner\"?\n I think the reason for that is because it was so obvious that the state could not, prior to prohibition, discriminate. It was not only embodied in the Wilson Act, but it was embodied in at least three cases of this Court.\n But it was not obvious to the person who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first instance, because as I as I understand it, there was an anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped. And do we know why it was dropped?\n It was dropped essentially because it was redundant.\n Well, but is that a is that on a legislative history record somewhere? Do we know that?\n No, Justice Souter, that is not expressly on the record. What is on the record, however, is that the Court was aiming or, excuse me, the Congress was aiming at specific Supreme Court decisions. There and it and the one case that was clearest on point on discrimination was Scott versus Donald, applying both the Commerce Clause and the Wilson Act to forbid discrimination. And there was there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to overturn that decision. And as this Court has held in Craig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty First Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate both the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore to the states the police power that they had before prohibition. Emphatically, discrimination was not a part of that police power. It was a very accepted context. So, too, is it today. When the when the liquor distributors in the states asked this Court to overturn the Bacchus decision and to adopt a plenary view of the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not just asking you to overturn the Bacchus decision; it is asking you to overturn cases starting with the Midcal decision in 1980, the more recent Healy decision, and others, that have held that the core purposes of the Commerce Clause and the Twenty-First Amendment must be harmonized, that the Commerce Clause was never intended to be obliterated. And when you look at the core values of the two clauses, they do not clash. The core purpose of the Commerce Clause is nondiscrimination. The core purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment is temperance. And if you have a discriminatory statute, it sends a very strong signal that, in fact  \n Well, it's not only temperance, but it's control over revenues. Can you tell me, is the is there a New York State excise tax on alcohol?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n And is it collected by the wholesaler?\n Yes, it is.\n All right. What is it, ten dollars a gallon, or what?\n It's it turns out to  \n Is it on one  \n a few cents a bottle, yes.\n It is on one  \n It's on it's and all alcohol.\n Under our cases, can the California winery be required to remit the tax to the New York State revenue authorities?\n We believe so, Your Honor.\n Is that consistent with Quill?\n It is consistent with Quill. The way that the states there are 26 states that allow direct interstate shipment of wine, and the FTC has examined their record to see if they are doing okay. And one of the things that they do are able to do is tax collection. New Hampshire, Louisiana, and Nevada do collect taxes. The way they do it is by requiring a permit in order to ship wine into the state. That takes care of a number of problems, including all sorts of accountability concerns that the state may raise.\n What  \n Under  \n what do you make of the argument that there's no practical way, except at great expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?\n Justice Souter, this is one of the most regulated industries in America, of course, and the model legislation that has been adopted by a number of states includes record-keeping provisions, it requires that wineries  \n Well, I will grant that's required, but the argument, as I understand it, is, to find out whether they're doing what they are required to do, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit. And that's one thing in the state; it's another thing across the country.\n No, it's important to recognize, Justice Souter, that under the three-tier system, which is which is where the states of New York and Michigan are saying that the other state wineries have to go the three-tier system does not do that. The states already rely on the Federal Government and the other states to police the wineries.\n So you're  \n Should they  \n saying they are not dropping in to local wineries to do audits, in fact?\n They may, in some instances. It is primarily a federal a federal activity.\n What do we have in the record on that?\n There is not there is not a great deal on the record, either way, on that, Your Honor.\n I don't know what you mean by \"it's primarily a federal activity,\" that the Federal Government polices compliance with the state tax laws?\n That's correct, Your Honor. Under the  \n How does that occur?\n under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, any violation of a state law is a federal offense and it is a violation so basically, whether it's under-age access, whether it's taxation, whatever  \n But does the federal authority make a routine audit to see that the state tax has been paid?\n Basically, every single time that there is a transaction, it is recorded by the U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau. And if it may please the Court, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time  \n Yes.\n for rebuttal.\n I have just one further question. Justice Kennedy asked you, \"What about the wholesaler? What about the retailer?\" What about alcoholic beverages other than wine?\n Justice Ginsburg, very important question. We are here today because a majority of states have chosen to regulate wine distinctively. And a handful of them, including Michigan and New York, have chosen to do so in a discriminatory manner. So long as states do not discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard to other alcohol and they don't; there's a flat prohibition across the United States, in terms of beer and other types of spirits we will not be here, because there would be no discrimination; there would be a single rule, and that rule would be, no one gets to do it.\n Thank you.\n Ms. Sullivan?\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Nothing in today's case, Justice Kennedy, requires you to take on the three-tier system, for the issue that is presented here is a very narrow one.\n Well, it's very narrow, but the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked. I just don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical where a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the you know, the physical facilities and so forth that the New York wholesaler does.\n All that we ask in this case, Justice Kennedy, is that you strike down Michigan and New York's decision to apply the three-tier system to everyone except their own in-state  \n Well, I know, but what  \n producers of wine  \n but you're all you're asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.\n Justice Kennedy, in our case, we want to suggest that it is just as in Healy and Bacchus that a law that discriminates in favor of in-state producers and against out-of-state producers loses its immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment. As Justice Scalia said in concurrence in Healy, a liquor law's discriminatory character eliminates the immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment. It's really the state's position, aided by their wholesaler allies, that it is the sweeping one. Their position is that every state law that regulates the importation of liquor is, per se, valid if it has any conceivable rational connection to a state purpose. So, for example, if Michigan wanted to simply bar all California wines, facially exclude California wines, saying, \"There are too many of them, it interferes with\"\n Your answer to Justice Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about.\n That's exactly correct, Justice Ginsburg. As you've said in the context of gender discrimination, you can cure an equal-protection problem by leveling up or leveling down. In this case, we would suggest that the principle of free trade that was the reason, the principal reason, for the framing of the Constitution and has been reflected in over a century of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, suggests that you should the remedy should be to open the markets to out of-state producers  \n But that's a decision for the state to make. I mean, the what  \n Correct, Your Honor.\n Not for this Court.\n That's correct, Your Honor.\n You don't deny that a state that Michigan could bar all out-of-state wine not just not just California, but they could bar all out-of-state wines?\n That's correct, Justice Stevens, if it were in aid, and only if it were in aid, of the states and necessary to serve the state's internal purposes.\n The only reason being given to give a monopoly to local producers, that's their  \n That's  \n whole purpose. But could they do that?\n The state can have a monopoly if it's, itself, a market participant. What the state may  \n No, I'm saying just to look at the just limit to the market to the only market participants would be Michigan wine  \n Private  \n wineries.\n Justice Stevens, a state may not discriminate against out-of-staters for the sole purpose of economic protectionism.\n Well, I'm trying to think of what Brandeis could have been thinking.\n In Young's Market.\n Yes, that's right. And this is a reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have no doubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of the dormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name of original package doctrine  \n Correct.\n which meant that the foreign liquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor. Now, he's thinking, \"Why is that? What is that package doctrine?\" And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause the dormant Commerce Clause is the implication from the existence of the commerce power in the Constitution. So if we have an amendment that says \"that aspect of the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply,\" that means the dormant Commerce Clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant Commerce Clause into six different parts, or even two.\n But Justice  \n Now, maybe I think that's how he's reasoning.\n But  \n And if he is, and even if he isn't, why isn't that right?\n Justice Breyer, the Young's Market language permitting state discrimination is, indeed, broad, but it's been superceded by 40 years of this Court's jurisprudence harmonizing the Twenty-First Amendment with the rest of the Constitution. Remember, Justice Brandeis, in Young's Market, didn't even think the Equal Protection Clause applied to liquor imports, a position that's inconsistent with Craig against Boren. And nobody would suggest today that equal protection permits a state to import only from male-owned wineries or only import wine from white-owned wineries. So there the 40 years of jurisprudence  \n But Craig against Boren was  \n has been  \n had nothing to do with the Commerce Clause.\n Correct, Your Honor, but if if there were a law the states are claiming that any law governing  \n Nothing to do with importation, either.\n But the dormant Commerce Clause reflects a fundamental structural principle that is every bit as much a part of the Constitution as the Equal Protection Clause upheld in Craig v. Boren. Indeed this Court, in cases from McCulloch to the Eleventh Amendment cases and state sovereignty cases, has recognized that a principle of the Constitution is no less fundamental because it is a structural implication of the text. So the dormant Commerce Clause stands on the same footing as the affirmative power of Congress and on it's the same footing as the Equal Protection Clause at issue  \n Do you think Congress  \n in Craig v. Boren  \n could enact a statute authorizing the states to do just what they've done here?\n Absolutely, but it has not. And the Wilson Act to go back to Justice Souter's question and Justice Ginsburg's question Congress could authorize it as it has done, for example, in the McCarran Ferguson Act, allowing the states to discriminate against out-of-state industry with respect to the industry of insurance. It has not done so here. Webb-Kenyon did not authorize discrimination, and the Wilson Act forbade discrimination for just reasons Justice Ginsburg described. It said you may regulate imports of liquor in the same manner as local liquor laws. And, of course, the purpose of Section 2 was to allow to the dry states to keep dry by preventing all those original packages from piling up in the railway stations and being open to bootleggers throughout the state, undermining the dry policies of the state. Wilson forbade discrimination. Web Kenyan didn't authorize it. And in Congress' most recent articulation of its view of the harmony between the Twenty-First Amendment and the rest of the Constitution, the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, passed in 2000, enacted in 2000, Congress has a rules-of-construction section that says, \"We view any state plea to the federal courts to enforce their laws as reflecting the jurisprudence of this court.\" And, in fact, floor debate on that rules-of-construction section reflected allusions to Bacchus, Healy, and the other cases that said dormant commerce the negative implications of the Commerce Clause, no less than the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Establishment Clause, constrain the states in their regulation of importation of liquor. So with all respect to Justice Brandeis, Justice Breyer, the Young's Market statements about discrimination have been superceded. What New York and Michigan have done here is say that one set of exceptions apply only to in-state producers, just as Connecticut, in Healy, said, \"If you just sell beer within our state, you don't have to face price ceilings that you have to face if you do business over in Massachusetts or Rhode Island.\" Just as in Bacchus, the you struck down a decision an excise tax exemption that said, \"If you're an importer of liquor, you have to pay an excise tax, but if you're a local producer of locally produced wine and spirits, you get out of that restriction.\"\n Okay, we've got one difference from Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here, which I gather was not made, or made seriously, in Bacchus, is there really is a need for differential treatment for purposes of enforcement. Go back to the enforcement of the tax law.\n Justice  \n How are we supposed what standard are we supposed to use to judge that argument? And, by that standard, how good is the argument?\n Justice Souter, we believe the standard should be strict scrutiny, though there must be a necessity to serve  \n Because  \n a legitimate  \n it's facial discrimination.\n Because it's facial discrimination. It's absolutely undisputed. Michigan in fact, Michigan state concedes that they have flatly banned out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers. There's no question that this is facially discriminatory. But even if the standard were a more deferential one in which all the state needed to show was a reasonable need for discrimination, it can't come close to doing that here. Neither Michigan nor New York has shown that the facial discrimination here is necessary to protect minors or to protect the collection of taxes. Let's start with minors. The Michigan claim that it's protecting against under-18 sales is belied by the fact that Michigan is allowing 40 Michigan wineries and, at last count, 7500 Michigan retailers to deliver directly to consumers. The way to protect my so just as in Craig v. Boren, the exception for young women to drink 3.2 beer, as opposed to young men, belied the state's interest in temperance. So the pattern of exceptions here that Michigan has created belies any notion that it's protecting under-18-year-olds from drinking. And, of course  \n But what about audits for revenue  \n On revenue, the nondiscriminatory means that's available to the state that Michigan and New York have not shown any reason to reject 26 states have adopted some version of this is to require an out-of-state winery to get a permit. And that's a Justice Breyer, one thing that's still left of Brandeis. You can require a permit from an out-of-state winery, which would be unusual to acquire from widgets or milk. But you can require a permit, and, as a condition of the permit, Justice Souter. The out-of-state winery has to agree to submit to the state's jurisdiction, to submit to the state's tax jurisdiction. And, Justice Kennedy, whether or not Quill would permit taxation if you were simply sending by common carrier, our clients want to want to pay taxes, want to sign up for permits, want to play on a  \n Well  \n level playing field  \n well, they do today, I'm sure, but [Laughter.]\n But, Justice Souter, to look at the experience  \n They you say they don't want to go to California to do an audit.\n They certainly don't, Justice Souter, but New Hampshire is a state that has actually your own state is a state that has on its Web site a set of out-of-state wineries. It requires that they keep and supply sales records on a monthly basis, that they keep those records for three years  \n Maybe we're getting ripped off.\n I [Laughter.]\n think New Hampshire's done very well collecting taxes from out-of-state producers, Justice Souter. It's a leader  \n Ms. Sullivan  \n in the field.\n may I may I I just want to clarify one point. It was just the question Justice Stevens asked. It's your position that if Michigan allows Michigan wines to be sold and possessed and consumed, that it must also allow out-of-state wine to be sold, possessed, and consumed. Would  \n That's correct.\n That is your  \n That's correct, Justice Kennedy. But to go back to the physical-presence question, Justice Souter, Michigan is not now Michigan officials are not now traipsing up to the upper peninsula and all around the state to inspect wineries. The record is clear on that. What Michigan does is require that wineries in Michigan send samples and records to their offices. And the Internet actually, if anything the states say that the Internet increases the danger, but the Internet also increases, in parallel, the power of the states to police out-of-state wineries without an in-state presence. Just as, Justice Stevens, the Internet may make every speaker with a PC a town crier, as you said  \n Could  \n in Reno versus ACLU  \n could a state  \n so it makes every interstate  \n could a state require an out-of-state winery to keep its books online, subject to a password, so that, with a password, they could go in and audit the books across the country, by wire?\n Yes, Justice Souter, if it were part of a an agreement to a permit that the that the out-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no extraterritorial regulation there, that would be just fine. So, yes, the state can, through Internet, so to speak, Internet monitoring, through virtual monitoring do all the work it needs to do to make sure that the out-of-state winery is paying taxes. And, by the way, Michigan does not collect taxes, Justice Kennedy, through the distributors. Michigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're in-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers. So Michigan can give no justification for why out-of-state wineries have to go through the distributors for tax purposes. They're not using the distributors as their tax-collection agents now.\n Commerce Clause, in effect, protects consumers in states from entrenched business interests that want to have protectionism, and you're you object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do it. Under that rationale, aren't all the California reciprocity laws invalid, as well?\n Justice Kennedy, reciprocity laws yet possibly. They may be a necessary requirement now that so many states are closed to states. They may be a necessary mechanism for some states trying to get wines to market in the way that the framers envisaged. It may be a necessary, for now, to get into closed states. In a world that we hope that you create, in which discrimination is not allowed, they would be completely unnecessary and possibly unconstitutional. But to return to the key point here, Michigan and New York may not facially discriminate in favor of their own producers unless they can show that reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives are unavailable. And here, Justice Souter, on any standard of heightened scrutiny, they have not come close to making that kind of showing, because there are all these other means means that have been recognized by the 26 states that don't discriminate, means that have been proven in states from New Hampshire to Virginia, means that are not based on facial discrimination. It's the discrimination that has to be shown to  \n Let me just  \n be necessary here.\n be sure I heard your answer to Justice Kennedy correctly. You'd concede that the reciprocity laws are all unconstitutional?\n Not they are subject to heightened scrutiny because they discriminate against out of-staters in a way that you could not for example, in New Energy, you said that you can't have a preference for you can't have a discrimination in Ohio in reciprocity for Indiana. Reciprocity laws normally do violate the principle of dormant Commerce Clause invalidation.\n And you contend that they do the liquor reciprocity laws, all of them are unconstitutional.\n Not we contend that they would be subject to strict scrutiny, and they could be upheld if the state could show that they are closely tailored in a  \n They can that they can be  \n way that these laws are not.\n upheld by making a showing that you say is virtually impossible to make.\n Your Honor, that's not before, and if there were other reasons  \n No, but I think it is  \n the state could [Laughter.]\n it is an interesting question as to whether that's a that's a you know, that's a necessary consequence of this decision, in your view. you to reach the question of whether there are other state defenses in other cases. The justifications the states have given here are so terribly weak in relation to their discriminatory laws that you should strike down these laws, you should invalidate them, you should affirm the judgement of the Sixth Circuit and reverse the judgements of the Second Circuit. Thank you very much.\n Thank you, Ms. Sullivan. Mr. Casey.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: For more than 70 years, the Twenty-First Amendment has permitted states to restrict the importation and delivery of alcohol by out-of-state vendors. There are substantial differences between licensed in-state vendors of alcohol and out-of-state vendors that are not subject to the full extent of state regulatory and taxing powers. Because of those differences, Michigan requires that sales, including direct shipment of alcohol, be performed only by licensed, strictly regulated, in-state vendors. This importation regulation is a power expressly conferred by the text of the Twenty-First Amendment. It's consistent with the entire history of alcohol regulation in this country, and it's consistent with this Court's jurisprudence interpreting the Twenty-First Amendment  \n Now the Bacchus case cuts against you, to some extent.\n The Bacchus case was a very unique situation that we believe is not in any way controlling in the present case. It was not an importation case; it was an exemption from a state excise tax on wholesalers for alcohol that was already within the state's stream of commerce.\n Well, but I think what's fairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to look at the language of Bacchus, and the language of Bacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination component of the Commerce Clause to liquor control. I think that's a fair and necessary reading of the case. Now  \n I disagree that that is a necessary reading  \n And I know it  \n of the case.\n involved pineapple wine and all that. I know that, but [Laughter.]\n what we're talking about is the language of the Court in that case.\n Correct, but you're you have to understand that language in light of the actual context. There, the state did not even assert a Twenty-First Amendment defense.\n Well, then you have to understand Young in the light of its context, where there was no discrimination  \n There was discrimination in Young, Your Honor, and I'd like to get to that. But to focus on Bacchus for a moment, the state never asserted the Twenty First amendment, and it was undisputed  \n No, but the question was before the Court, because the dissent certainly raised the question.\n Correct. And we have suggested, in our brief, that the Bacchus case is distinguishable and not controlling here. We have also suggested that Bacchus was incorrectly decided. We can prevail in this case without overruling Bacchus, but we have suggested that  \n Well, why don't you focus on that? Because it's a little hard to plan on overruling that case. [Laughter.]\n Well  \n So why don't you at least address how you would distinguish Bacchus? Because there is a lot of language in there that cuts against your position.\n The only justification for the statute in Bacchus was what the Court characterized as \"mere protectionism.\" That's not the situation with the Michigan statute. Again, the Michigan statute involves the paradigm or the quintessential Twenty-First Amendment power of regulating importation; it's not an attacks on alcohol that's already an exemption from a tax for two particular products.\n Well, no I mean, that  \n Do you  \n that rather lengthy statement you made earlier, that the Bacchus case didn't involve the importation of alcohol. But it did. I mean, the only reason that the in-state exemption was held to be unconstitutional was because you were treating out-of-state sellers differently. How can you possibly say that  \n It was treating  \n the case didn't involve it?\n it was treating two particular items of in-state production differently than all other in-state items and out-of-state items; but it was a taxation issue, not an importation issue. And as the Court said in Bacchus and in Capital Cities, the correct analysis in the in evaluating this kind of case is to determine, first, whether the activity of the regulation at issue is an exercise of a power conferred by the Twenty-First Amendment  \n Well, why don't we focus on the Court's rationale, which was stated very concisely by Justice White. He said, \"Hawaii's discriminatory tax cannot stand.\" And then he said, \"Whatever you can say about the Twenty-First Amendment, one thing is certain, the central purpose was not to empower the states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers to competition.\" That was this Court's explanation for ruling the way it did, even though there was this infant industry of pineapple whatever.\n That was the first stage of the Court's analysis. The Court went on to say it was not supported by any clear concern of the Twenty-First Amendment in combating the evils of an unrestricted traffic in liquor  \n Well, your opponents have said that there isn't any clear countervailing interest here. They're saying you can't claim you're protecting kids, because you're selling to the kids at home; there's no serious audit-collection problem; and the other regulatory interests they didn't say this, but are, sort of, gauzy the way they're stated. I mean, they're saying that, by a process of elimination, what you get down to is nothing but discrimination and protectionism. What is what is your answer to that? Where is  \n We  \n the substantial interest?\n we disagree wholeheartedly with that. The Michigan  \n I know, but  \n the Michigan regulations do promote the state's interest in temperance. They do give the state a better  \n Well, you I mean, you say that, but how? The very activity that you don't want them to engage in, you're engaging in, or your local wineries are engaging in, for example.\n But the key is, with an in-state licensee, the state has the ability to enforce against that licensee, to inspect, to punish the licensee  \n Do we  \n to hold them accountable.\n do we have a record of what the state is doing with respect to its in-state licensees, indicating what it could not do effectively to out-of- staters? What do we have in the record?\n The record in this case consisted of a small number of affidavits, answers to interrogatories, some surveys that were submitted as exhibits to motions for summary judgement. Both sides submitted that type of evidence. The District Court decided this was a question of law, and specifically said that he did not consider any of the factual evidence. So the record  \n Well, should  \n was not fully developed.\n should we send it back for if we disagree with the rationale, should one or the other of these cases go back for evidence on what, in fact, the state is doing in relation to its in-state licensees and evidence that it could not effectively do the same with respect to out-of-staters?\n Yes, if  \n And what would you show? What do you, in effect make an offer of proof.\n We would show that the Michigan requirement limiting sales and direct shipping to in-state licensees is required because the state only has effective enforcement authority over in-state licensees. But  \n Well, but wait a minute. You it was suggested that the state could require a license of an out-of-state supplier, and that that license could be conditioned upon submission to Michigan's jurisdiction in all respects. Is that not feasible?\n Michigan does have a current license for out-state seller of wine. You know, these players  \n But could you not require submission to  \n We  \n Michigan's jurisdiction for all purposes of enforcement?\n Certainly, we could pass a law to that effect. The problem is  \n And if you if you did that, could you require, as I suggested of Counsel on the other side, that you that, as a condition of the licensing, that the business records of these companies be placed in some secure online fashion, that, with a password, you could get into and do an audit across the continent just as readily as you could do an audit next door? Could Michigan not do that?\n But there is no guarantee that such an audit would be just the same as an audit of an in-state  \n Well, let me ask, once we accept the proposition I think this is the necessary reading of Bacchus that the Commerce Clause applies to liquor and prevents discrimination, it seems to me it's just like any other commodity food, milk, et cetera and, in this case, you have a very substantial burden to show that this discriminatory treatment is justified maybe strict scrutiny, maybe heightened scrutiny. And this trial has occurred. You have had that opportunity. I don't see why you have a right to go back.\n Despite the lack of evidence in the record and the fact that District Court did not consider that evidence, the Sixth Circuit dismissed all of those claims of the state and remanded for entry of judgement on the Plaintiffs without giving us an opportunity to develop that record. I also want to say  \n See, I don't I don't understand. Didn't you have an opportunity to develop the record? I mean, this was  \n There was  \n a discriminatory matter. It was your burden to show that whatever discrimination existed assuming that we find the law the way Bacchus seemed to say it is it was your burden to show that there was some justification for that discrimination.\n There  \n You had your chance to show it.\n there was evidence in the record. There were affidavits from Michigan enforcement officials about stings, about problem with enforcing  \n All right, well  \n against Internet  \n tell us what those what that material is, and if we find that material sustains your burden, that's fine, you win; and if it doesn't, you lose. I don't know why we have to let you go back and [Laughter.]\n and retry the case.\n Our key position is that before you get to that kind of evidentiary burden, the legal question  \n That's what I'm interested in. You win, either way. If it maybe if the Commerce Clause dormant Commerce Clause discrimination principle applies, you win, if we scrutinize strictly and say you have a good justification. Whether you do or not, I guess I'll find out from reading the record, but I'm more interested in the first half, which is doesn't apply at all. Now, your opponent said, in response to my pointing to Brandeis on this, that to support you, as to precedent, Bacchus. Young's Market isn't any good anymore. As to concept, you can divide the dormant Commerce Clause into a you have to favor out-of-state principle, which was the original package doctrine, which has long since disappeared, and the anti-discrimination principle, which hasn't disappeared. And her third part, implicit, is, historically, this whole Section 2 was aimed at the original package part; there is not a word in any brief I saw that suggests any motive in Section 2 to get rid of the anti-discrimination principle. I haven't found a word in support on your side on that. So she says, \"Put those three things together, and we win.\" That's her point. Now, what's your response?\n We disagree with that entire position. The text  \n I know you do. [Laughter.]\n the text of the Twenty-First Amendment the text of the Twenty-First Amendment gives states the right to control imports. The history of the Twenty-First Amendment in the Webb-Kenyon Act clearly demonstrate the purpose of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to eliminate alcohol shipments from  \n Do you think  \n the Commerce Clause.\n that Michigan can prohibit the importation of any wine, but still allow its own wine to be produced, sold, and consumed?\n Yes. That's precisely what situation was with  \n I know you do, but the principle of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the Wilson Act was already there very clear is to stop the original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out of-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you had to sell less. I mean, that's what it's there for. I didn't find a word, in other words, contrary to what I've just said; and if there are such words, now is the time to point them to me to point them out.\n The title of the Webb-Kenyon Act is, \"It is in an act divesting intoxicating liquors of their interstate character in certain cases. The clear intent of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to remove alcohol from the Commerce Clause. The Constitution the Twenty-First Amendment constitutionalized that Commerce Clause framework.\" That's what this Court said in Craig v. Boren. Craig v. Boren also said, \"The Twenty-First Amendment creates an exception to the operation of the normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause.\"\n Well, then you are asking us, I guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first one that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive and well? Was it Justice Stewart? And I forgot which case it was. It was  \n That may be. The Commerce Clause remains alive and well, but the Commerce Clause  \n In the context of alcoholic beverages.\n In the context of powers expressly conferred upon the states by the Twenty-First Amendment, that's an exception to the operation the normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause. Commerce Clause has to be read in light of the Twenty-First Amendment, just as the Twenty-First Amendment has to be read in light of the Commerce Clause and other provisions of the Constitution.\n But that's a different argument than the one you made before, which seems to be saying the Twenty-First Amendment trumps, not that the two have to be harmonized.\n When you read the two in light of each other, the purposes of each, it is clear that the purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment was to remove alcohol from interstate commerce as a constitutional matter, to prevent Congress from tampering with it in the future, to give the judgement to the states as to  \n Well, you  \n the necessity for  \n you say further than that; you say the purpose was to allow that the states discriminate in favor of home industry, if it chooses.\n That is one of the purposes, yes. In that in the case that was decided immediately after the Young's Market, Mahoney, and Indianapolis Brewing, the Court said, \"Discrimination is permissible in this narrow context, where the state is acting pursuant to its Twenty First Amendment powers and regulating importation of alcohol.\"\n But that gets us back to Bacchus and what to make of that.\n I as I indicated, I don't believe Bacchus overrules those cases; it didn't even cite most of those cases. But  \n Well, the dissent seemed to think so [Laughter.]\n didn't it?\n That's correct. But, as I said, we believe Bacchus is distinguishable, because that was mere protectionism, the state does have other justifications here  \n Well, we've also said that mere protectionism is permitted.\n Mere protectionism is permitted. In this case, if we have to present other justifications, we have, and there are other justifications, unlike the situation in Bacchus. So even if the Bacchus rationale is good law, we still prevail on that. Thank you, Your Honor.\n Ms. Halligan?\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In answer to your question first, Justice Breyer, the Twenty-First Amendment does not propose a nondiscriminatory ban. The Court rejected that position, not just in Young's Market and Mahoney in Indianapolis, but also in Clark Distilling, the case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act, itself. It held that the Webb-Kenyon Act operated to remove any immunity that had been conferred by the dormant Commerce Clause. Bacchus is not to the contrary. In North Dakota, which follows Bacchus, the Court relied again on Young's Market to say that the states could impose different rules on out-of-state vendors where they were necessary to protect the integrity  \n Do you do you take the position that your colleague on your same side takes, that a state can permit only the sale, consumption, and of its own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?\n The express terms of the Twenty First Amendment would allow that if particularly if it were necessary to advance the concerns of the Twenty-First Amendment. For example  \n No, no, don't  \n No  \n don't put in the qualifications.\n just for local protectionism.\n Simply for mere protectionism?\n It's just for local protectionism. We want to promote our wines, and not anybody else's.\n The terms of the amendment would allow that, but I don't think the Court needs to explore the outer parameters of the Twenty-First  \n Well, I'm trying to understand what your  \n the Twenty-First  \n what your theory is. And so you are in agreement with your colleague that this could be done, if New York chose. You can only drink New York-grown wines in sell and consume in the state of New York.\n It could be done, but that question really isn't presented here, because  \n But could Congress pass a law forbidding it?\n That's a difficult question, because  \n Yeah. All right. But I need an answer to it. [Laughter.]\n Because, you see, what's going to come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say, \"Well, didn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act?\"\n Let me answer both of those questions, if I can, Your Honor. Certainly, this Court has held, repeatedly, that the Twenty-First Amendment did not, in any substantial way, completely repeal Congress' affirmative power under the Commerce Clause. It said that in Midcal and Capital Cities. But we would argue that if Congress acted in a way which completely removed state authority to determine whether or not alcohol could be sold and the terms under which it could be sold for example, if Congress said all states must be dry then we would argue that the Twenty-First Amendment wouldn't allow that, because that would completely eviscerate any state authority.\n How can that be? I mean, if this is a constitutional elimination of the Commerce Clause, how can Congress bring it back in simply by enacting a statute?\n The legislative history makes clear that the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to eliminate the impediments posed by the dormant Commerce Clause and authorize states to regulate it.\n But you you want us to read it by its terms. It doesn't say anything about the dormant Commerce Clause. If we read it absolutely the way one of your arguments wants us to do, surely it excludes Congress.\n By terms of our  \n So you don't want us to read it absolutely.\n Your Honor, I don't think that again, I don't think that you need to decide those questions in this case. This case goes to what's at the very core of the Twenty-First Amendment, whether states can decide who can sell liquor to their citizens and whether or not states  \n But it also goes to the very core of the Commerce Clause. And there are really two classifications of dormant Commerce Clause cases. One is and I think it's an improper use of the term \"dormant clause\" is where there's discrimination. Only the Congress can allow discrimination against out-of-state products. That's one whole classification. And that's what's and that's what's involved here.\n North Dakota indicates otherwise, I believe, Your Honor. In North Dakota, this Court said that, because, when alcohol flows across the border, it poses unique risks to the regulatory regime, because the state can't bring the alcohol within the full extent of its regulatory and supervisory powers, that it may be appropriate and necessary for states to impose unique rules on out-of-state vendors. In North Dakota, the Court did not say  \n Well, but that's fine. And the other side isn't denying that here, that if, you know, they're discrimination means treating out-of-state people differently without good reason.\n But there is good reason  \n Now, if you're willing to okay, if you're willing to acknowledge that, then we're halfway there and we're just arguing about whether there is good reason here or not.\n There is good reason here, Your Honor. What's critical about New York's law, as well as Michigan's law, is that it requires that any alcohol vendor have a physical presence in the state. And that's important for a couple of reasons. The state can't meaningfully oversee traffic in alcohol with an out-of-state entity. Petitioner suggested  \n What is it doing with the in state entities? I mean, one of the claims is that nobody is posting officers outside the in-state wineries, no one's making substantial physical audits of in-state wineries. Is that wrong?\n It is wrong, Your Honor. It's certainly not the case that we have an SLA inspector outside every entity that sells liquor. That would not be possible. But it is true that the state liquor authority can, and does, physically inspect the premises. They do so to determine whether  \n What do they inspect them for? Their books, I suppose.\n Well, more than that, and this is why the physical presence is important and why the Internet hypothetical that Your Honor raised would not would not satisfy the state's concerns. What the state can do is, it can go onto a premises, and it can count whether the bottles on the shelves of that premises match the records. That's the best way to detect whether or not there is evasion. Because if you have  \n And is there a record that the state is doing that?\n There is not clear evidence in the record with respect to that to that level of detail, but that  \n Well, isn't that the end of that issue, then? I mean, it is your burden, isn't it?\n Your Honor, there is material in the McKeon affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix Mr. McKeon is the Chair of the state liquor authority but it's also the case that to suggest that because there is some option out there and there's no firm evidence that a less prescriptive rule would, in fact, satisfy the state's concerns in preventing diversion and tax evasion but the possibility that's there's some rule out there, because other states have adopted more lax rules, is to treat alcohol like any other product. And the Twenty First Amendment reflects a consensus by this nation that alcohol is unique, that it should not be open to  \n Well, the Twenty-First Amendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated as unique, and the issue here is whether you're really doing that in a way that supports your claim of interest.\n Yes  \n And, so far, the one specific thing I've heard from you is that state inspectors do go on winery premises, and they count bottles, and they see if they match what's on the written record.\n They also draw on the assistance of local law enforcement. And this is also  \n But if that's  \n set forth  \n if that's really what New York's concern is, then why does New York say, \"Ah, but out-of-staters, if only you establish an office here not a winery; an office you can operate, and you can make the direct sales from that office, and even in\" I think your brief told us that, well, these small wineries, out-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry about, because, after all, they could join together a group of them could open an office. Now, that office, owned by a group of out-of-state vintners is not going to have bottles on the shelf, is it?\n Yes, Your Honor, it would. That's the state laws requires that any licensed winery have a government-bonded storehouse or ware-room storehouse storeroom or warehouse, pardon me  \n Well, isn't the  \n The reason for that is because physical products  \n How do you envision this combination of small wineries? You said that in-state establishments might be jointly maintained by out-of-state wineries.\n Yes, Your Honor. The state liquor authority has not issued any regulations on this, but presumably what they would say is, you could share a space, provided that the physical property of each winery, the bottles, is segregated so that the states can come in and check whether or not each winery's products conform with their records. There are other reasons why a physical presence is important, as well. First of all, the state draws on local law enforcement extensively to identify illegal activities, and that would not be possible with any entity located out-of-state. Additionally  \n What illegal I'm sorry you've got to be specific. What illegal activities? Selling to minors?\n It could be selling to minors, but it could also simply be sale out of an unlicensed premises, where you are selling outside the proper hours of sale, or sale outside of the three-tier system  \n Yeah, but if licensed premises don't serve a state interest, then you can't require a licensed premises, so that argument doesn't get too far.\n But, Your Honor, the principle that having entities that sell liquor be licensed, is one that is at the heart, not just at the  \n How does how does requiring them to have an in-state office somehow prevent them from shipping to minors from out of state  \n It  \n or from shipping to consumers from out of state without paying you their tax?\n It  \n How does the opening of an  \n Right.\n an office in New York State at all prevent that?\n It can't prevent it a hundred percent, but no  \n It can't prevent it at all.\n Your Honor, it can deter it, and it can deter it significantly, because, first of all, there is a much more significant opportunity to identify the illegal activities; and, secondly, if a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer knows that, that operates as a powerful deterrent  \n What did  \n We seem to be talking may I just ask one we seem to be talking about two different things. Justice Scalia was assuming that, if you have the license and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from outside. And I is that the assumption? Or is your argument that New York can require does require the in state warehouse, and you can ship into in New York, you can ship only from that warehouse?\n To be clear, the state has not issued regulations that specifically address that point, because  \n So the we don't know yet.\n We don't know. But in talking with the state liquor authority, they have made it clear that their intent would be to require that the liquor come first to the in-state premises  \n Well, even if I'm willing to assume that. How does that guarantee that the out-of-state winery will not, in violation of New York State law, ship directly to minors or ship directly to consumers, just simply bypassing its cache of wine in New York?\n There is no guarantee, Your Honor, but there is never any guarantee  \n There's no guarantee.\n that people won't  \n It doesn't it doesn't enable you to enforce your law any more rigorously than without having a requirement for a local office.\n That, I would respectfully disagree with. It does operate as a powerful deterrent and  \n Well, your argument there is that  \n as an investigative aid.\n if they break the law, you can shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can't effectively do that if the warehouse is in California. Isn't that your point?\n That's one of the points, but also that we're much more likely to be able to identify the illegal activities in the first place. The suggestion that we would send inspectors to California or any other place to look at books and count bottles is completely infeasible. And the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to allow states to deal with the regulatory challenges that are posed when liquor comes across the border. If we had to demonstrate that there was a hundred-percent compliance, then we couldn't have any regulation at all. That's not, I would submit, a  \n Well, to what  \n reasonable measure.\n to what extent does New York take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the states from which this wine is coming? You say we must do this to police for all kinds of things. But don't other states California, Virginia don't they have laws that their local wineries must meet?\n They  \n And is New York just saying, \"We're going to treat this thing as though it's totally unregulated, anyway\"?\n We're not suggesting that, Your Honor. What we are suggesting is that relying on other states to enforce law violations in New York State is not a very feasible alternative. Additionally, there are 33 states that have agreed with New York, a number of whom are states that have either reciprocal or unrestricted shipping statutes, and said to this Court, \"Please do not prohibit the kinds of laws that are at issue in New York and Michigan.\" So it's obviously important to the regulators in those states, as well.\n What about the states that do a allow shipment from out of state? They don't care about their  \n I can't  \n How many are there that allow shipment from out-of-state wineries?\n I believe that the current number is 26 states. I certainly can't speak to the regulatory motivations of each of those states, or the reasons why those laws might have been passed.\n It certainly suggests that what that what you're arguing is not essential to the state's enforcement of its alcohol laws.\n Well, a number of those states have, in fact, joined New York and Michigan in asking the Court not to  \n States don't like federal regulation  \n restrict that.\n of any sort, of course. I know that. [Laughter.]\n Your Honor, I think that all the Twenty-First Amendment requires the states to demonstrate is that the regulatory regime that they have chosen has some relationship to their goals of protecting the integrity of the state's system. And that's certainly what the Court suggested in North Dakota.\n Well, I'm not sure. When you have facial discrimination against out-of-state products, I think you're the bar is a little higher than that.\n Well, that was the case in North Dakota, as well. In North Dakota, the state imposed regulations on out-of-state vendors that were extremely onerous, so onerous that some vendors said they wouldn't ship products at all. That was alcohol that was not even destined for consumption within the state; but on a federal enclave. And the mere risk of diversion into unregulated and unlawful channels was enough to allow the state to impose those discriminatory rules. The same is true here. Justice O'Connor, you also asked about Bacchus, as well, and I would like to take a moment to address that. Bacchus is distinguishable in several ways. First of all, Bacchus was a tax. And while we would argue that taxes could be used to further states' interest in suppressing consumption, for example, it is certainly not at the heart of the of the Twenty-First Amendment in the way that the direct regulation of alcohol across the border is.\n No, but if you can't grant a tax exemption and it seems to me, a fortiori you can't grant a prohibition about importing at all.\n I, respectfully, would disagree with that, Your Honor. If you can't address the alcohol that flows across the border, which was precisely why the Twenty-First Amendment was enacted, as well as Webb Kenyon, because the  \n No, I'm suggesting a tax on imports is less restrictive than a prohibition on imports.\n Well, we would certainly, you know, welcome the authority to do both, but importation is what is at the heart of the Twenty-First Amendment. Bacchus is also different, because, there, the state made no effort whatsoever to defend the statute with reference to any concerns related to the Twenty-First Amendment. And Bacchus  \n And according to the District Court, in this very case, the State Attorney General conceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.\n That was an off-the-cuff remark by a single attorney, Your Honor, and that can't be taken as dispositive, given the state's vigorous defense of this statute. It also was regarding a provision that is not even directly before the Court right now which confers no different shipment privileges than are conferred on any winery, whether in-state or out-of-state, that would obtain a license to sell in New York.\n Thank you, Ms. Halligan.\n Thank you, Your Honor.\n Mr. Bolick, you have, let's see, about four minutes left.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. Three very brief points. There his a panoply of tools available to states to police out-of-state wineries in direct shipping, as the Federal Trade Commission has recognized. They can, if they issue a permit, revoke that permit. And New York has authority to issue such permits under Section 105-9. The Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, for which the liquor distributors and states lobbied very hard, gives injunction authority in the home federal courts. And, of course, the federal agency, the Tax and Trade Bureau, can revoke a permit if state law is violated. In the  \n Who's going to count the bottles? [Laughter.]\n Your Honor, the state the Federal Government is able to count those, but the evidence is that they don't. And that goes back to a question, I believe, Justice Souter asked. In the Michigan case, a question was posed in an interrogatory, \"What enforcement by is done of in-state wineries.\" In that regard, the answer was, \"None.\"\n How do you count bottles? I would have thought the consumers have all the bottles. [Laughter.]\n That's exactly right. And, certainly in the directly shipping context in-state, that is emphatically the case.\n I think they were referring to full bottles. I guess [Laughter.]\n With direct shipping  \n They've all been drinking [Laughter.]\n to arbitrators.\n With direct shipping, Justice Scalia, we can personalize things. In terms of the Bacchus case, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, New York, like Hawaii, conceded protectionism. It is very rife in the legislative record in 1970, when the direct shipping was extinguished. In 1995, when Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have solved this problem, he said, and I quote and this is in the record, the Joint the Second Circuit Joint Appendix, at 442 he said, and I quote, \"Since the vast majority of this country's wines are produced in California, I believe that this bill would inevitably lead to a significant increase in mail-order wines from that state into New York. This increase could, in turn, lead to a decrease in sales for New York liquor stores and their distributors, and shrink New York wineries' market share. That is protectionism.\" And, finally, the notion that small winemakers could go to all 50 states and open offices in order to do this if you could drive out to Middleburg and visit Juanita Swedenburg's winery and she invites you to do so [Laughter.]\n you will find Mrs. Swedenburg selling wine, harvesting grapes, and bottling. This is a ban on this is market foreclosure, sure and simple fewer than 600 wineries are represented on the stores of New York's shelves, out of over 3,000 wineries  \n The question  \n in the United States.\n really is whether the plain language of the Twenty-First Amendment allows that very protectionism.\n And I would refer you, in my brief time remaining, to the brief, the Carter-Phillips brief for the Napa Valley Vintners Association, the DKT Liberty brief, which go into the history of the Twenty-First Amendment, which was intended to restore the police power, which did not include the power to discriminate. Our clients cannot compete with the liquor distributors in the political marketplace in their in their in their home states. They can, however, compete in the economic marketplace. The Commerce Clause protects that right, that level playing field. The Twenty-First Amendment was never intended to take it away. We ask this Court, respectfully, to honor 124 years of precedent in the National Economic Union. If there are no further questions, thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Bolick. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Petitioners submit that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits an employment practice that has a significant disparate impact on older workers if that practice lacks any reasonable business justification. The ADEA embodies Congress' determination that age discrimination seriously impedes older Americans' ability to participate fairly in the American work force.\n Mr. Goldstein, let me just interrupt a minute. You say if it lacks the the business justification. But is it not a part of that is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is it, that it does not show? That's an affirmative defense.\n Justice Stevens, there is not a clear answer to that question in all candor. It is not before the Court. I will tell you that the lower courts uniformly in the ADEA disparate impact context apply Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Watson and the Wards Cove rule rather than the post-1991 Civil Rights Act rule. That is a debatable proposition because, as your question suggests, in subsection (f)(1) of the statute where this provision comes from and let me just take us to the language. It would probably be most useful. In the blue book, the the blue petitioners' brief at page 1 are the relevant provisions. (a)(2) we'll come back to. That's the parallel language to Griggs. The reasonable factor other than age provision is (f)(1), and it says: it shall not be unlawful for an this is at the bottom of the page. It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited and I'm going to come back and focus on that under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age. The fact that it says otherwise prohibited seems to suggest that this is setting up an employer defense, as your question indicates. And the Court in the the Western Air Lines case in 1986 said that the BFOQ provision, which is in (f)(1) as well, is an affirmative defense. So I  \n You put your finger on exactly what's the part of this case that's bothering me. Read through the language. As you read through the language, disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this particular provision, reasonable factors other than age, seems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to disparate treatment. And that all seems to work. But you read the definition of reasonable factor other than age to mean business necessity or even Justice O'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough. It's hard for an employer to make that defense. And while making it hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly well. You start making it hard to make that defense here and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment of his or her employees is going to have a disparate impact in respect to age because the correlation with age runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other cases. So I can't believe that Congress really would have wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is because I can't believe the business necessity part of it. And so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the same time, pulls in disparate impact and business necessity, and now I don't know what to do.\n I can tell you. (Laughter.)\n The answer is that you should recognize, as does the commission, which has delegated rulemaking authority under the act, that business necessity, which is the term of art that they used in the regulation and we'll come back to it. It's at page 2 of the blue brief means different things in different contexts. And so I want to take you to the specific citations where the EEOC has recognized the common sense principle. We know that more things that are legitimate employer practices correlate with age than they do with race and gender. It is  \n Mr. Goldstein, before you do that, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this statute doesn't at least on on the page 1 part you called our attention to, doesn't refer to business necessity. That's in the EEOC regulation. If I were just reading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like an affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems like something quite different than necessity. It isn't necessary for the business to do this, but it's reasonable. And if that's then the business necessity it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper construction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when it referred to business necessity. They were thinking of Griggs and and title VII, but this statute says reasonable factors.\n Yes. Our position relies only on the statute. We embrace the text of the statute. (f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be reasonable. We agree with that. The point I would then take you to is that in if the Court were interested in the regulation we don't think it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it were, the EEOC has said that it too recognizes that the phrase, business necessity, in the context of the Age Act does not mean essential to the business. Let me tell you why it used the language it did, business necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up. And that is when this Court first used the words, business necessity, in Griggs and then subsequently in Wards Cove, it didn't have all the connotations that it does now as being quite a high employer burden. If I could just read to you two things from Griggs. Griggs said, the touchstone is business necessity. If the employment practice cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited. It simply required related to job performance. That's the backdrop on which the EEOC used the word.\n Well, I'm not sure you're right about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of what it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high school diploma. Now, an employer might well think I want to upgrade my work force. I want this to be a real classy work force. So I'm going to require a high school diploma. It isn't necessary, but why is it unreasonable for me to do that? So I I don't I think Griggs spoke about rules that were built in headwinds because a large part of the population didn't have the opportunity to get high school diplomas. That doesn't exist in the age discrimination area. So I I don't think that Griggs is an example of something that was a loose business necessity rule.\n My point is only terminological, and that is, when the EEOC used those words, it did not do so against a backdrop in which they carried a connotation that was necessarily very strict, and it has said several times and they are quoted in our brief that the standard and this is just the bottom line. I think it's a very important bottom line.\n You don't care about those regs anyway. Right?\n We do care about the regulations.\n Oh, you do. I thought you were saying you could make your case just on the  \n Well, we have  \n text of the statute.\n We can and will.\n Well, maybe you should because I'm not so sure that the EEOC interpretation is entitled to Chevron deference.\n We do believe that it is entitled to Chevron deference because they have delegated rulemaking authority and there is some suggestion that the because of language in subsection  \n But was this an actual rule after notice and comment, or is it a an interpretation?\n It is a post-notice and comment rule.\n But but it interprets doesn't interpret the prohibitory section. I mean, it it might be understood as simply making an assumption that, say, the Griggs rule would be applied in in this Court.\n It's conceivable you could read it that way, although the EEOC has specified many times, in the quarter century since it enacted the regulation, that no, when we and let me take us to the text to explain why, and that again is at page 2 of the blue brief. They said and this is the block quote. When an employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other than age, and such practice has an adverse impact on individuals. That's the reference to disparate impact. The regulatory materials cite to Griggs. But in all events, I do want to come back to the bottom line, and that is the EEOC recognizes, we recognize that it's easier to prove either a defense or to put the burden on the plaintiff's case. It's a you have a higher hurdle  \n Easier easier is a matter of degree.\n Yes.\n And reasonable factor could be interpreted to say what the employer but the employer just doesn't like paying these executives so much money when these new younger janitors make so little. And so he says, I want to pay the new younger janitors more. Okay? There we've got it. Disparate impact.\n No.\n And now you say, what's the business necessity? And frankly, there wasn't one. It's just that I found it sort of bad. All right? So there we are. I've lost my case. Now, that's what is worrying me, and I thought perhaps this reg that seems to say and lower courts have accepted that I would lose my case that this reg is outside Congress' the agency's authority for that reason because Congress couldn't have intended that result.\n Well, let me take you to the lines of cases that I think might concern you. There were a set of cases before this Court's decision in Hazen Paper that involved two rules, Justice Breyer, and I will tell you that you referred to in the Adams oral argument when this case this issue came to you before. And so I want to refer to a very specific set of cases. There were a set of cases before 1993 in which there was some correlation. High salary correlated with age. And the courts of appeals, the Third the Second Circuit in the Geller case and the Eighth Circuit in the Leftwich case treated that as effectively a disparate treatment disparate treatment case because of the high level of correlation. The more recent cases reject that result and we embrace the more recent cases. And I want to cite them to you so you could look them up if you wanted. The Evers case, which is 241 F.3d 948; the Williams case, which is 112 F.Supp.2d 267; and the last one is Newport Mesa, 893 F.Supp 927. These cases recognized that cost is a perfectly legitimate business justification, and they put a single burden on the employer. Now, let me just just to say, most impact cases aren't cost cases, but I know it's a concern. They say, look, if you want to cut your costs and get rid of your more expensive work force, we're only going to ask you to do one thing, and that is allow your more senior workers to take a pay cut. They do not say, as did the older cases, that it causes disparate impact and you lose your case. And so we don't  \n Mr. Goldstein, you this is this case arises out of a compensation program of the employer, and why is it brought under 4(a)(2) instead of 4(a)(1) which addresses discrimination in compensation?\n Justice O'Connor, the lower courts unanimously conclude, as does the commission, that (a)(2), although it does not have the word compensation in it, does apply to compensation and  \n But why in light of 4(a)(1)?\n Because they understand 4(a) and let me take you everyone to the text just so we can all be literally on the same page, and that is going to be in the red brief at page 17a. It is 623(a), and it's the first block quote at the top of page 17a of the red brief. They understand that 623(a)(1) refers to actions against individuals, whereas 623(a)(2) refers to actions against groups, group policy versus individual action, and they do that because of the introductory language to (a)(1) and (a)(2), to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual; whereas, (a)(2) refers to limit, segregate, or classify his employees.\n May I ask a question at this point going really back to the question I asked you at the outset of the argument? If I thought seniority or years of service was a reasonable factor other than age and if I thought this particular compensation program was based on years of service rather than age, can I look at the reasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your complaint states a cause of action?\n Yes. Hazen Paper established that that is not  \n And if I do look at it and if I do come to the conclusion I've suggested, would I not have to dismiss your complaint?\n I may misunderstand the hypothetical, Justice Stevens.\n The hypothetical and I think it may be the case that you have a compensation program which uses years of service as a basis for classifying employees which has a disparate impact on older workers, but it does also it relies squarely on a reasonable factor other than age if you will call years of service such a factor.\n Yes. That's perfectly legitimate. That as I understand the hypothetical  \n suppose I want  \n I understand that to be this case.\n No, it would not because the rationale given by the employer here for let let me take us to the facts and then the explanation that's given by the employer. What happened here is they gave all of the line police officers much bigger raises than they gave to the more senior officers. That and the difference in pay between protected persons under the ADEA and non-protected persons was 4 standard deviations, a 1 in 10,000 chance, statisticians will tell you. And they said  \n No, but the basis for differentiation was years of service, was it not?\n The basis for differentiation was years of service, but the question is in is it a reasonable choice by the employer in this context. And the reason is it's a  \n Well, I'm just asking in the abstract. Why wouldn't that always be a a reasonable factor other than age?\n I apologize. That and so I think I answered your hypothetical too broadly. And that is, it depends. In the great majority of cases, employers certainly can say I want to give a class of employees more money. Perfectly sensible. Congress didn't intend to block that. But the question is, is this outside the usual set of cases? And the city's explanation what for this policy, which was to give the line cops more money but not the rest of the cops who happen to all be over 40, was that they wanted to bring the salary up to a a regional average. And so we asked the question, does this accomplish that in a reasonable way, and it does not because they left out huge categories of employees.\n But the factor if I understand it, it wasn't because they were line officers, it was rather because they had lesser years of service than the more senior officers.\n No.\n No.\n That is not the facts here. That's right. They they did not say we are going to give pay raises to the people who have lesser years of service because we're concerned about their pay. To the contrary. Let me take you to one piece of the record that I think will be helpful. Although again the cases presents the legal question, the lower court on remand can resolve the case. But at page 15 of the joint appendix, there is the pay plan itself, and the first sentence is that they explains the purpose. The the city wanted to provide a compensation plan that will attract and retain qualified people, and then it says, to all employees regardless of age. They purported to be giving the same treatment to everyone regardless  \n I don't think the statement of purpose tells me what the what the criterion for the different treatment was. I still think it was years of service.\n Justice Stevens, I I just think that it misunderstands the facts as I know them in this particular case.\n What was the criterion?\n The criterion was that they took the they had different kinds of officers. They had police line police officers, master sergeants, all the way on up through the system.\n So in other words, the criterion was the kind of rank they had before.\n Yes, and then  \n Why isn't that a reasonable factor other than age?\n The question is not whether that because that's not having those criterion is perfectly reasonable. The question is, is it reasonable and this would be resolved on remand to give raises to only one of those categories when your explanation is that you were trying to give raises to bring everyone up to a regional average? And so, Justice Stevens, I think  \n In other words, you say the the question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor other than age. Your question is whether the use of those factors was overall reasonable.\n Yes. There are two things.\n That's a rewriting of the statute.\n Oh, I I don't think so, Justice Stevens. It's the same question that we ask in title VII, and that is, was it a a there's a higher bar there, but were you pursuing a a legitimate goal and did you did you pursue it in a reasonable way? That's why a title VII plaintiff and this has and I do want to come back  \n Title VII doesn't have this language in it.\n That's absolutely right, but it's not language here that would detract from that structure of the of the title VII inquiry. All the lower courts, for example, agree that it as I said, follows the pre  \n Here you're saying you're not attacking reasonable factor other than age. It has to be based on reasonable factor other than age. And I take it here you're saying it's not based on what they advance as reasonable factors.\n Yes. They give  \n Is that right?\n Yes. They give an explanation.\n But if I I say my explanation for why I pay the newer people more is really I like to have that atmosphere. You make less money in my business, but it's more democratic and people are happier even though no one will invest in my company. (Laughter.)\n But still, I'd like a commune. All right? That's how I want to do it. Now, that's not totally idiotic. It's plausible. So I just win. Right?\n No. You would lose a treatment case.\n Ah, I lose a treatment case. No, no. I'm not I'm just it's I'm not paying the younger workers more. I'm paying the newer workers more. All right? They happen to be much the same category, but I I don't want it. It's not age. Or, you know, I pay the lower paid workers more. How's that? Do I win?\n You paid the lower paid workers more?\n Yes. I paid the lower paid workers more? I want to bring them up to the executives. I I like it. It's more democratic and it makes a happier group. And and so, now, do I win or lose?\n You, in all likelihood, win in that hypothetical. You  \n I win. And I don't have to say any more than that.\n No. But let me tell you, it's still a very important statute because for the reason that I framed before, and that is, most cases that are ADEA disparate impact cases are not cost cases. There are other tests: applications procedures, strength tests, and the like. That's what the EEOC believes is still very essential. So while we don't impose a big burden on employers in the cost context for the reasons that you and Justice Stevens have been exploring, that doesn't mean our position is somehow worthless. The EEOC has said that the disparate impact plays a, quote/unquote, vital role under the ADEA and that the respondents' position would greatly weaken the statute because  \n There haven't been a whole lot of cases under the impact theory as applied to age, and you just said you're not talking about the cost category but that you mentioned physical fitness. And there was a case. Smith against Des Moines involved that, but it was found the the physical fitness test was job-related. Have there been mutual rules with a disparate impact that you can give us as examples? When you're talking about race and sex, the examples come to mind much more readily than in the age category.\n Yes, I can. I'll give you two sets of examples. The first is the examples identified by the Solicitor General in his cert petition defending the EEOC's position in the Francis W. Parker case in 1994. The EEOC pursued cases and they're cited in the cert petition involving rules that prohibit that require recent college graduates to get a job that forbid hiring someone who worked previously for a higher salary than they would be getting in the new in the new job and that laid off people who would be eligible to retire soon. So those are the examples the Solicitor General gave. I'll give you two other examples. One is a a case called  \n These are examples of violations or things that are okay?\n Violations. I apologize. The EEOC filed suit because of these violations of the act.\n Why isn't it a reasonable factor other than age that I don't want to hire somebody who's going to retire a year after I hire him?\n Because it's not  \n Gee, that seems to me terribly reasonable.\n The  \n I don't care how old he is. I don't want anybody who's going to retire the year after I hire him. I don't want to have to go through this this whole process again.\n The view of the commission it's one I share, but a particular court might not is that that is not a good a reasonable work place judgment. One could disagree with it. But the those employees will be very valuable. And it's not that they will retire, I should make clear. It's that they're eligible to retire. It it may well be a different case if you could say, I asked the person. They said they're leaving in a year. The rule challenged there was mere eligibility to retire, and they did give the other examples. I didn't finish with the court cases. They are Klein, which is 807 F.Supp. 1517, which is a hiring test I think by the FAA in that case that that happened to exclude all of the people, I think, over the age of 55. And there are other cases that are, in the line of cases that I was discussing with Justice Breyer, in which the employer doesn't say doesn't give the person who gets the higher pay the option of taking a pay cut before being fired. So the statute, both in the non-cost context and the cost context, has very important applications. I did want to return to your correct premise, however, Justice Ginsburg. You said there aren't many cases. I think it's important to recognize that the the important, legitimate cases, by and large, are conciliated by the EEOC. Remember, it goes through an administrative process first. The EEOC found a violation here, gave us a right to sue letter. The the city just declined to settle with us. There have been and I have checked. There have been 74 disparate impact cases in the history of the statute that are reported in the Federal courts, and I think that is a good answer to the idea of the respondents that this will impose a huge burden on employers, the idea that there will be a massive amount of litigation. Remember  \n Well, once we if we were to say it's covered, don't you think that number would expand?\n It's possible it would expand some, but I do think we're right to say not much because  \n Well, it's not the number of cases either. I mean, you could have it wouldn't take much to have a single case that has a rule in it, say, that makes it very difficult for an employer to do things of type X or type Y, and that would have enormous impact even though you'd say, well, it was just one case.\n Well, there are two fears I think the respondents have articulated, neither of which are borne out by actual experience because, Justice O'Connor, the EEOC has recognized these claims for a quarter century. Until 1993, every single circuit agreed with us, and right now three circuits agree with us. So I there is a large body of experience that suggests and that's where those 74 cases come from. So, Justice Breyer, they have two concerns. One is the mere notion of the possibility of liability will and the prospect of how expensive litigation would be would be deterring valuable employment practices. That's not borne out by experience. Your point is, well, what if the liability threshold is too high? And experience suggests and the rules endorsed by the commission and the lower courts are that the liability threshold is not too high. I did also want to say that it is the liability threshold that is the key for deciding how to accommodate the respondents' concerns. Justice O'Connor's Watson plurality opinion explains that the evidentiary standards that apply in these disparate impact cases should serve as adequate safeguards. The precise, same argument was made by the business community in Watson, saying, look, we're going to have to adopt quotas. This will be entirely unmanageable. Before I sit down and reserve the remainder of my time, I did want to say we have a really good case, to refer back to my last argument, and that's Griggs, which is about the exact same statutory text. And then we have a line, a wall that is uninterrupted of this Court's authority. Six straight decisions say when the statute title VII says something and the ADEA says the same thing, they have the parallel construction. And in our view the respondents' arguments aren't good enough to overcome the double hurdle of stare decisis and Chevron deference. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.\n Mr. Nager.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: If I may, I'd like to go straight to the question as to why mere statistical correlations with age don't create a prima facie case of discrimination because of age. This Court in its title VII cases has said that a mere statistical correlation with race or sex can create a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or sex because it's advanced a proposition that there's no inherent correlation between race and sex and ability to perform a job or do a job. And as a consequence, the Court has said that a statistical disparity is a departure from the expected norm. Thus, the statistical disparity creates a suspect situation which could be treated as a prima facie case of discrimination because of age, to use the Court's term in Watson, the functional equivalent of intentional discrimination. In the age context, the premise doesn't apply. In the age context, as Justice Breyer pointed out in the Florida Power argument, as he's pointed out again today, age is inherently correlated with myriad selection practices. It's painful to say, particularly to a Court that's a little bit older than I am, but our mental and physical capacities are not constant over our lifetimes. They're different for each one of us, but statistically they change over time and they deteriorate over time, and progress doesn't treat the skills and abilities that we have with the same way to people who are at different stages in life. Our education and our technological  \n Verdi wrote Falstaff when he was 70 late in his late 70's. It was his greatest creation. Something.\n There is no doubt, particularly in occupations like judging (Laughter.)\n that experience and wisdom may be something that grow over a lifetime. But as we know  \n Wunsler died at about 28, didn't he?\n No. 34.\n 34, well  \n Let me let me ask you this. If if your argument has force, why haven't we been having horrible example piled upon horrible example since 1981 when the EEOC took the position that it takes?\n The answer to that is as follows, is that Justice Chief then Justice Rehnquist, now Chief Justice Rehnquist, wrote a dissent from denial at the time of Geller v. Markham. And in my practical experience and I do defend these cases for a living that put a tremendous chill on the plaintiffs bar, and there were very few of these cases brought. But contrary to Mr. Goldstein, who doesn't represent employers and help them plan their selection practices, employers made huge changes in the '80's and the early '90's until this Court's decision in Hazen Paper because employers were scared of these cases, and so employers started managing the numbers. There were a lot of reductions in force in the late '80's, as I'm sure this Court remembers, as our Nation went through a a industrial restructuring. And every one of those reductions in force, I had to sit down with my clients and break up the age of the work force into bands and see how people were going to be affected and move numbers. And the irony, of course, is is in doing that, employers adversely impact the very people who are benefited by the disparate impact doctrine under title VII because the Age Discrimination Act principally favors more senior, older white males, and when you try to manage your numbers so that you don't adversely impact older white males, what happens is is you adversely impact the new entrants to the work force who in the last 25 years have been much greater numbers of racial minorities and females.\n What do you do about the EEOC's regulation? Why isn't that why isn't that entitled to Chevron deference?\n Let me answer that. First of all, the the answer is, is you only get to Chevron deference if this statute is not subject to construction by this Court in phase one of Chevron. The first question is can this Court, looking at the language of the statute and the other legal materials, interpret the statute to have a single, reasonably clear meaning.\n How can we possibly say that it's not ambiguous when we have, in another context, interpreted the identical language to permit  \n Just the way this Court did last term in the General Dynamics case, which I realize you dissented on this point, Justice Scalia. But just last term in the General Dynamics case, this Court held that the phrase, because of age, is idiomatically and contextually different than the phrase, because of race or sex. And my point to Justice Breyer is is that the phrase, because of age, cannot properly be construed to be satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.\n In that in that case, we were construing the word age and age definitely has a different meaning from sex or or race.\n I'm not saying that the the General Dynamics case disposes of this case, Justice Stevens. I'm simply pointing out that, as Justice Souter's opinion for the Court last term held, that similar language in similar statutes can have different meaning and not be ambiguous.\n Yes, but not whole texts, not I don't remember whether it was (1)-(1) and (2) or (a) and (b), but this is not a word, age. It's it's lines and lines, and to and to say, oh, in Griggs we held that the title VII language this language means you can have a disparate impact theory, but in age, we're going to read those very same words to prohibit. In one sense one you read to say, these words permit disparate impact, and then you read the same words to say these words prohibit  \n No.\n disparate impact.\n That is not quite right, Justice Ginsburg. What we're saying is is that the natural meaning of the phrase, because of, either in title VII or in the Age Act, is a natural, more conventional reference to intent. Nonetheless, the Court, because of the objectives of title VII and because statistical correlations could equal a functional equivalent of intentional discrimination, construed title VII to go beyond intent-based claims to encompass disparate impact claims. Our point to the Court today is is that neither of those two critical premises apply, that a mere correlation with age does not, in the context of age, equal a prima facie case of  \n If that's so, Congress shouldn't have copied the language of title VII. It isn't a matter of it just accidentally comes out to to be sounding the same, as though, you know, two monkeys did it on a typewriter or something. They copied they copied title VII.\n Well, they copied it before Griggs was decided, indeed, before any agency of Government, before any court in this country, and before any academic in this country had floated the concept  \n Well, I think it's a fair conclusion that they meant the two to mean the same thing, whether it was before Griggs or after Griggs. They copied the language. It seems to me they wanted the two to mean the same.\n I I think that that's wrong, Justice Scalia.\n Or or at least it is arguably so, in which case you come back to my question. Why isn't the the EEOC's resolution of that ambiguity conclusive?\n Well, let me answer that question directly and then come back and argue with you about your premise. If you turn to the appendix and on the red brief, page 56a is the regulation. And it is as Justice Kennedy pointed out, it is not an interpretation of the prohibition of the statute. It is an interpretation of the reasonable factor other than age provision. And as an initial point, I'd submit to you, Justice Scalia, that it's one thing to defer to an agency's interpretation of the provision that you're being asked to construe in resolving what the meaning of the provision you're being asked to construe is. It's another thing to defer to their interpretation of a distinct provision which isn't a prohibition at all. Let me move on and let's read what it says, though. What it says is is the following. It's interpreting a phrase that says is based on a reasonable factor other than age, which Mr. Goldstein has conceded in his brief and the petitioners in the Florida Power case also conceded is necessarily a reference to intentionality. But there's not a word in this regulation about employer intentions. Quite the contrary. And the reason why I I asked you to turn to page 56a of our brief rather than the quotation of the regulation in Mr. Goldstein's brief is because there's an additional sentence in the regulation that Mr. Goldstein didn't print in his brief, and that is that the EEOC said where tests are involved  \n Where where are you reading from?\n Page 56a of the red brief. I'm sorry, Justice. It's section (d).\n (e)?\n (d) as in David. What the EEOC said is that the reasonable factors other than age provision is not an intent-based provision. It's a business necessity provision. They did it, saying it means the same thing as it's as it means in title VII because their whole purpose here was to conform the Age Act to title VII, and they said you have to comply, where tests are involved, with the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection that they jointly promulgated with the Department of Labor, the Justice Department, and the Civil Service branch, whose name has escaped me right now.\n Mr. Nager, I'm lost. What what part of 56a are you referring to? (d)?\n (d) on page 56a. I'm sorry?\n Does it say what you just said?\n Tests which are asserted the last sentence. Tests which are asserted as reasonable factors other than age will be scrutinized in accordance with the standards set forth at part 1607 of this title. Part 1607 of this title is the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection.\n All that's true, but they they did promulgate this guideline, as far as I looked it up. At that time, they said, look, it's going to be disparate impact, and they cited Griggs. And people have put comments, which I haven't read yet, but I imagine the comments went to disparate impact. And then when they rewrote it in this form, they have a little paragraph of explanation which makes pretty clear it's meant to be disparate impact.\n I have no doubt that they were assuming that this Court's decision in Griggs because this is what they said in their comments this Court's decision in Griggs required disparate impact analysis  \n Well, all right. But I mean, they everybody knew what they were driving at at the time they promulgated this. So it seemed to me that if if we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the reg is outside the statutory authority. And it might be outside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too tough a test.\n It's it's outside the the statutory authority for two reasons.\n But now we've heard it doesn't embody that much of a tough test, and you know, the EEOC isn't here to tell us  \n Well  \n what in fact it thinks.\n Mr. Goldstein cited a bunch of EEOC briefs in his brief, and you'll notice he didn't quote a single part of of those EEOC briefs which say that the standard under the Age Act is less than the standard under the Age Act. What he cites to is a footnote in his opening brief where he quotes one sentence from an EEOC brief where an EEOC appellate lawyer said it is is likely that an employer will be able to prevail more often. The EEOC never said and and I litigate against them. I can tell you the only thing that they would hate less but hate a lot than your ruling in our favor that there's no disparate impact claims at all is that Mr. Goldstein has represented what their version of the defense is because that's not the Government's position.\n All right. So we don't know what the Government's position is. They're not here. So suppose I think, one, the language is against you, the language of the statute. I do think it's against you. Two, the EEOC reg does foresee a disparate impact test. Three, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and that has to go with the scope of the statute. And four, it might be possible for the EEOC to write a reg that deals with the problems you're worried about while advancing a disparate impact test. Suppose I think all those things  \n Which one  \n which are at least consistent. What would I do with this case? That's my problem.\n Okay. I I would submit that you should  \n Where the Government hasn't appeared and told us what they want to do or what they think should be done, et cetera.\n I I should I would submit, Justice Breyer, that you should reexamine your premise that the language of the Age Act, both in section 4(a) by itself and construed in light of 4(f) and the legislative history and purposes of the statute encompass disparate impact claims.\n Maybe the EEOC regulation was not so much an interpretation of the statute as an interpretation of Griggs.\n Oh, I think that's  \n I mean, maybe this provision represents the judgment of the agency that Griggs applies to this other statute, and and I'm not sure that we owe Chevron deference to that determination.\n Well, I I don't think you did, although I don't even think, frankly, from what I've read is they made the judgment. They made the assumption.\n Yes, well.\n Mr. Nager, will you go to another one of Justice Breyer's premises? He says following the practicalities are with you, which you're certainly going to accept. He says I think the EEOC can deal with some of these practical problems. Do you think so? Why not?\n Great question and the answer is no, they can't. And the reason is  \n Give me some examples.\n The reason is is because if you if you lower the prima facie case so that it's meaningless, so that it means that all a plaintiff has to do is find a selection practice because it's always going to correlate with age it means you shifted the burden to an employer in every case to establish that its its practice meets whatever standard your hypothesizing the EEOC might come up with later, Justice Breyer. Meanwhile, the world has to go on, and what my clients will do is as follows. They will say, well, you know, we're not going to wait to see if if this new practice we're going to consider is going to stand the test of time in court and under the EEOC's yet-to-be-articulated regulation. We're going to stick with the tried and true. We are not going to innovate at all, and if we're going to innovate, we're going to massage the numbers while we do it. The employers  \n That would be a fairly easy burden a fairly easy burden to meet. And and to give you a fairly easy burden is consistent with the idea of trying to get employers to think about the problem. An employer who uses a different factor which is correlated with age but it's it's an unreasonable thing to do or it isn't the real basis hasn't thought about the harm that he's working.\n Well, as  \n So we could give you an easy burden and still accomplish the objective.\n I I don't want to resist the easy burden, but I do want to tell you, as Justice Scalia pointed out in the Florida Power argument, my clients do think about these things because if you know, if they adopt an unreasonable practice that has an adverse statistical effect and they think they're likely to get sued about it, they actually do have to worry about it because these cases are tried to juries and they have to have a reasonable explanation for what their practice because they get tried to juries as disparate treatment cases. Our point is not that statistics are not admissible. They are. Our point is is that they're not sufficient by themselves to create a prima facie case of because of age, as it would be in a title VII case where we wouldn't expect to see the statistical disparity. So it's fair to say that there's a reasonable adverse inference to be drawn from the existence of the disparity itself. That is the premise articulated by this Court as to why the disparate impact doctrine can can at the prima facie case aspect of it equals a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or sex. That is not true here. Now, it is also the case that when this Court adopted the disparate impact doctrine, it said it placed an enormous weight on the objectives of title VII's prohibitions, which it construed to be, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, eliminating these built-in headwinds. Well, when when the Secretary of Labor proposed the Age Discrimination Act, he gave a report to Congress and he said age discrimination is different than race and sex discrimination. It is not based on animus. It is it is not dealing with a group of individuals who have suffered cumulative disabilities over their lifetime because of historic discrimination. He said it's the problem of age discrimination is the problem of over-generalization by an employer.\n But he gave the very same example that was Griggs. He gave the example of the high school diploma because he thought that people of a certain age, when there wasn't such general education as there is today, might not have a high school diploma to a much higher extent than the people who came the generation who came after.\n But his solution was not a disparate impact doctrine. His solution was  \n Well, it's a little, and you said his solution was we're going to have training and manuals and all. But that's not altogether clear.\n Well, take a look at the statute, Justice Ginsburg. Please look at page 15a and 16a in the red brief. And if you look at section 621(b) it's at the bottom of page 15a of the red brief Congress said what the purposes of the Age Discrimination Act were, and it had three, but it's only addressed one through the prohibition. The second one was to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment. The other two were to promote employment of older persons based on ability and to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment. And if you turn the page and look at section 622(a)(1), the very first thing Congress mandates that the Secretary shall do to address its other two purposes, to undertake research and promote research with a view to reducing barriers to the employment of older persons and the promotion of measures for using their skills. What the Secretary of Labor's report goes on at length about is it identifies all kinds of factors, neutral and non-neutral  \n But it doesn't say there that that is to implement the first that that only the second one, to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination.\n It does what it you're right it doesn't say the following. It doesn't say, and we don't want disparate impact, because in 1967 the the concept of disparate impact as a legal theory was unknown to Congress, to the courts, and to the administrative agencies. But what the Secretary of Labor did do in his report is, after identifying all of the problems that adversely affect older workers, he says, I recommend a two-pronged approach. One prong is prohibitory. It's coercive. You shall not we'll prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment, which the Secretary explained to Congress, and this Court last term said itself, means a is a is is the use of age as the decision-making criteria. He said, separately we should have a series of programs that seek to enlarge the abilities of older workers, that seek to educate employers about the abilities of older workers through non-coercive programs. And so what this statute does and this Court has said it in several of its cases this statute was based upon the Secretary of Labor's report. The Secretary wrote the bill, and although Congress amended it in other ways, it didn't amend any of these provisions. That this statute took a more nuanced approach to deal with a distinctly different problem, and the problem  \n Mr. Nager, at the end of his report, Secretary Wirtz said the a purpose, to eliminate discrimination in the employment of older workers, it would necessary not only to deal with overt acts of discrimination, but also to adjust those present employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring. And your point, as I understand it, yes, that was one of his purposes, but he meant that one to be accomplished with ERISA and other things like that.\n Well, the quote that you just gave says that there are express uses of age and there are non-age reasons that lead to the use of express limits of age, for example, the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave with Mr. Goldstein, saying, well, I wouldn't want to hire someone who's going who tells me they're going to retire a year from now. But if he said I'm not going to hire you because you're 64 because I know you're going to people retire at 65 mostly, that would be the same kind of non-age-based motive that nevertheless used age as a decision-making criteria. That's what that quote is referring to. If you if you the second half  \n The quote the reference to employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to age limits in hiring. I see what you're saying.\n Right. And then and and the point here is this was thought out. It wasn't thought out as disparate treatment versus disparate impact because the concepts didn't exist at the time, but it was thought out as arbitrary age discrimination versus other factors that adversely bear on older workers. The prohibitions went to arbitrary age discrimination and didn't go to the adverse impacts. It was the the non-coercive measures that went to the adverse impacts. Let me go also  \n No how does that work? Because the the particular language, it shall be unlawful for an employer to classify his employees in any way that would adversely affect an individual's status his status, it says as an employee because of such individual's age. Now, that sounds as if it's driving right at disparate impact. It's it's unlawful to classify an employee in any way that would adversely affect him because of his age. That's what it says. And then you turn to the defense and it says, but there's the defense with a differentiation, i.e., the classification is based on reasonable factors other than age. And therefore it would sound as if it says, look at the factor and ask is the factor reasonable. If so, the employer wins if it's really based on that factor.\n Two points?\n Yes.\n One is is  \n How do we get out of that language?\n Well, we love the language. We don't have to get out of it. It says because of age. That's a reference, a traditional, conventional reference  \n No, no, but it says it says that would adversely affect him because of his age.\n Well, the first before the comma is the statement both of the action of the employer and the injury that it has to cause in order for a claim to exist, and then there's another requirement. The requirement is is that the action and the the effect of the injury that's affected by it be because of age. That is a conventional reference to intent. And the confirmation that it's a reference  \n Oh, no. It's not intent because to read it as part of classifying, which you'd have to do to get it because of intent, you'd have to say to classify his employees because of such individual's age. Now, that's a little tough because you're talking about employees, and then you go to such individual.\n It it the phrase, because of age, modifies all of the words that precede the comma that separates the two.\n Segregate or classify. You want to read it all the way up back to segregate or classify.\n Well, I I think it does modify the verb, but  \n It would be good if you had a comma after employees. I I might go along with you if there was a comma after to limit, segregate, or classify his employees, comma, in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of opportunities or otherwise affect his status as an employee, comma, because of such individual's age go way back to before the comma. I can see that, but without the comma, that's that's an awful travel back to limit, segregate, or classify.\n Well, I I think that's the grammatically correct way to read it. But even even if it was just modifying the adversely affect  \n It would be the natural way.\n it would still be because of age.\n The natural way wait. The natural way is to read it as modifying to deprive  \n Right.\n or otherwise adversely affect.\n Exactly.\n That's the natural way to read it.\n It is.\n Now  \n One still  \n suppose we read it that way. Then what do you say?\n You even if you read it that way, it still says, comma, because of age, and the because of age is a reference to intent, and the confirmation of that, Justice Breyer, is the defense that you keep pointing to because as Mr. Goldstein conceded in his brief and as you pointed out in your questioning, it says, is based on. That is also a reference to intent. This statute is preoccupied with intent. What section 4(f) was about was identifying the situations in which age would be used but it, nonetheless, wouldn't even be arbitrary  \n Indeed, and I guess what supports that reading is that intent intent to discriminate in hiring the intentional discrimination because of age in hiring is covered by (2) rather than (1) isn't it?\n No, no, no.\n You think I mean, if if you have a rule if you have a rule that you won't hire any employee I mean, we we were talking earlier about the the reason (2) reads employees in the plural, and (1) reads refuse to hire or discharge any individual. So if you have any intentional discrimination that is against a class, it comes under (2) rather than (1).\n I had never thought of construing the  \n Is that wrong? Well, I thought I thought that's what what counsel for the petitioner was telling us.\n Well, if if he did, he's only strengthened our case. What I want to say to the Court is is that both of those provisions are modified by the phrase, because of age. This Court in Hazen Paper construed the because of language in 4(a)(1) as a reference to intent and said statistical correlations with age are not sufficient to establish because of age within the meaning of section 4(a)(1). And the presumption of uniform usage we're entitled to point to it as well that the presumption of uniform usage which would be that the phrase, because of age, in section 4(a)(2) is also not satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age. And the reason why title VII is different than the Age Act I keep coming back to this because this is so critical, Justice Breyer is that the premise of the Court's statistical cases under title VII is that it's it presumes that there's no inherent difference in ability between the races and the genders, whereas you know and I know that there is a difference in an an inherent correlation between abilities and skills, between people of different ages statistically. And so that whereas in the in the race and sex context, a statistical disparity by itself points out that there's something suspect and so would justify putting the employer to the burden on those occasions which would happen. And by definition, I think you and I both think, Justice Breyer, that it's not all that often that you're going to have these statistical disparities in the race and sex context. In the age context, they happen all the time. So it's it there's no basis for suggesting that a statistical correlation by itself creates something suspect, and it would rob the notion of a prima facie case of any meaning to say that that a statistical correlation with age, which we expect to see all the time, would establish a prima facie wrong. And, of course, the Secretary of Labor wrote a report telling Congress that race and sex were different than age for this very reason.\n But in your view, is based on reasonable factors other than age strictly an affirmative defense?\n I I think that it is it was intended to address mixed motive cases. That's why it was added. I think it is a indicia of the fact that this statute is concerned with intent in its prohibitions only. I'm not saying it's conclusive of that, but I'm saying it's another indicia, that if you look at all of section 4(f), it's about the instances in which age is being used  \n But is it an affirmative defense?\n I I don't think that it is, and I I  \n Well, did you challenge the sufficiency of this complaint on the ground that it did not allege that the the program was not based on was based on factors that were unreasonable?\n I I didn't handle the case in the trial court, but I believe that the our our client denied all of the allegations in the complaint and affirmatively said this was its salary program was a reasonable factor other than age, yes. And certainly in the courts below, the reasonable  \n What I'm trying to think through is whether that issue is one that can be resolved on the pleadings, or does it always require a trial.\n Well, I think the question of whether or not the reasonable factor other than age provision, when read in conjunction with section (a)(4) 4(a) shows that this is an intent-based statute, as a pure legal question, can be judged on the pleadings. The the question of whether or not a in a particular fact situation something is a reasonable factor other than age or not I think would be subject to what the proof is. It might be undisputed.\n On your reading, I just don't see that there's any function. I mean, if disparate impact is out of it, then then what work is there for the reasonable factor other than age to do?\n It was added in as a safe harbor to address mixed motive cases. There was a concern at the time that since employers had been using age as the decision-making factor, that they would continue to think about it, and the question was raised, well, would that mean that the very fact they thought of it, even though they had a nondiscriminatory reason, mean that they still violated the act? And the Secretary said, no, we've put in this reasonable factor other than age provision to make it clear. It it was simply a safe harbor.\n Thank you, Mr. Nager. I think you've answered the question. Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes, and let's make it 4 and a half.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. I want to start with our affirmative case which is one of stare decisis and then go to what I think is the thing that might concern the Court and that's the practicalities of implementing our rule. Our stare decisis case I think is fairly decisive. The language of title VII was the model for the ADEA. It runs all the way through the same in subsection (a)(2). This Court construed the text of the statute to give rise to disparate impact liability, and there are six cases of this Court that say when the language is the same, because one was derived from the other, we give them the same meaning. Now, I take it that the respondents have three answers to that. The first is they attempt to rewrite the rationale of Griggs and say Griggs really isn't so much about the text of the statute. It's what Congress was getting after, and this Court in Griggs was principally concerned with the fact that, look, in the context of age and sex discrimination, there's no legitimate correlation between an a disparate impact and a legitimate employer policy. That is not, in fact, what the rationale of Griggs is. The rationale of Griggs is that it doesn't matter to the employee if you are purposefully discriminated against or accidentally discriminated against. Congress was concerned with the effects of discrimination. And this Court reached that conclusion based on the text of the statute. If I could read from Griggs, quote, the objective of Congress in the enactment of title VII is plain from the language of the statute. That's the same language as in our statute. The thrust of section 703(a)(2) was to address, quote, the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation. This Court subsequently reiterated twice that disparate impact comes from the text of the statute, not from the air. Those two cases are quoted at page 9 of our reply brief and they resolve all doubts about commas and because of or anything like that. The Court in both Connecticut v. Teal and Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court in Watson tied it directly to the statute. If I could just read the Watson example. Again, they're quoted in full. In disparate impact cases, quote, the employer's practices may be said to, quote, adversely affect an individual's status as an employee because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Now, the second argument they have and this was the Fifth Circuit's argument is the RFOA provision exists in the ADEA, not in title VII. I do not understand how the RFOA provision if it means anything, it doesn't help us. Again, let me take you back to the text. It's on page 1 of the blue brief. It's in a few other places, but it's there. It shall not be unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise prohibited under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age. The necessary premise of that provision is that something will be otherwise unlawful when it's based on something other than age. It can't be talking about disparate treatment. The only kind of liability that involves factors other than age is impact. And then on top of that, Congress required that the employer's conduct be reasonable.\n What of dual motive?\n Because the statute refers to something otherwise unlawful, it can't be talking about Price Waterhouse mixed motive. Price Waterhouse mixed motive cases establish liability; i.e., you're not liable if you had another reason for doing it. But the premise of (f)(1) is that it's already otherwise unlawful, this is a defense to that. The third thing that they say is that in Hazen Paper this Court construed the because of language in (a)(1) not to refer to impact. The critical difference is that the (a)(1) language does not include the the clause that refers to the impact on the employee that Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer talked about with Mr. Nager. They're structured very differently. As to the practicalities, let me just say this has been the rule for a quarter century of the EEOC. It was the rule in every circuit until 1993. It is still the rule in three circuits. The notion that there is a big problem with administering it and that the EEOC can't recognize the as it has in all the examples we cite, that it's easier for an employer to prevail in the ADEA context is not accurate. I also want to just agree with Justice Breyer, that an important part of impact liability is just making employers think about it. And that comes from Justice Kennedy's opinion in McKennon where he said that disparate impact, quote, acts as a spur or catalyst to cause employers to self-examine and self-evaluate their employment practices to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of discrimination.\n Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted the Beef Promotion and Research Act in 1985 in the midst of a serious depression in the beef industry. The beef industry found itself unable to respond to that situation through the promotion of its products. Congress responded to that situation by establishing a government program of promotion, research, and consumer information. In the Beef Act, Congress prescribed the central message for advertising under the Act, Congress established a government body, the Beef Board, to administer and implement the program, and it placed the program under the control of a Cabinet officer, the Secretary of Agriculture.\n Mr. Kneedler, will you tell us how this case differs, if it does, from what was before the Court in United Foods? What meaningful distinctions do you find?\n Well, the important distinction is that the two grounds that on which we are defending the statute here were not addressed in United Foods. In particular, the government speech argument, that what I've just said goes to, that the Court specifically did not address because it had not  \n We've never addressed that in  \n In none of these cases, and  \n in these cases  \n Right.\n have we?\n The Court has not. And we think that that is the critical point about this about this case and these programs, these are government these are programs of government speech. As I said, Congress, itself, prescribed the central message. Congress established the government board, all of whose members are appointed by the Secretary, to administer it.\n Does it remain government speech even if you don't say, \"This is your government speaking\"?\n It  \n If you say, you know, \"America's cattlemen are speaking,\" is it government speech?\n It does for purposes of this Court's government speech doctrine, it does. And I think  \n Why is that? I mean  \n And the Court the Court's decision in Rust, I think, is the best illustration of that.\n Yes, but Rust did not Rust was not a case in which the doctor was saying, \"This is my personal opinion, not the government's.\" And here, as Justice Scalia pointed out, there is an affirmative effort to say, \"This is this is paid for by\" whatever it's called, the cattlemen's group or the beef group, which affirmatively indicates that it's not government speech.\n Well, it all those statements say and there are advertisements in the record that say that the advertising is funded by America's beef producers, which is, of course, accurate, because they  \n Well, it's accurate  \n they pay for it.\n but it also contains the implication that who he who pays is the person whose speech is being broadcasted.\n Well, but, again, in Rust, the doctor who spoke I think the patient who went to see the doctor for counseling would have would have assumed or believed that the doctor was in the immediate encounter, that the doctor was speaking, and yet the Court, in its subsequent cases, has regarded Rust as a situation of government speech. But the important point about what you've just asked is that any concerns about the tag line in the advertising does not go to the constitutionality of the statute or the beef order. Neither the Act nor the order requires that in the advertising. And if the Court was to perceive that as a problem, the right remedy would not be to invalidate the Act, but to, instead, provide that there should be some different identification  \n Yes, but some people  \n on the advertising, itself.\n may be more resistant to an to an ad that says, \"Your government wants to eat wants you to eat more meat,\" than they are to an ad which say, \"The meat producers would like you to eat more meat.\"\n Well, I and I think in Rust, some people would have been resistant to the idea that your government wants you to engage in family planning, but what the what the Court said about Rust was that the government had established a program with a central message about counseling. That was then carried out by private individuals. Here, this case is much stronger than Rust.\n Well, but if you if you say the Act can be say, because this is just an as-applied challenge, you're asking us to assume that we can put on a label that's not true, \"This message is brought to you by your friendly Department of Agriculture.\" That isn't accurate.\n Well, it would be accurate  \n And you're having us save the statute by just putting a label on it that isn't accurate.\n Well, they're I'm sure that a label could be devised that would that would be accurate. The first of all, they are approved specifically approved by the Department of Agriculture. The certainly, the Act and regulations provide that the Secretary must approve every contract, every project for advertising. And, beyond that, the USDA approves all advertising, all copy  \n But, Mr. Kneedler  \n that is actually to be used, so there is specific approval by the Secretary.\n But there is there's another tape put out by the government, on meat, and that what is the government speech? Usually, the government has a position, and is presenting it. Here, we have America beef producers has a label on \"Eat meat.\" But if you went to the Surgeon General, probably that message would be \"Eat meat moderately.\" So what is the government speech? I don't know another case involving a claim of government speech where the message that you are saying is the government's is not the message that the government is putting out when it's dealing with its concern for public health.\n Well, the government, in the concern in situations where it may be concerned about public health, doesn't say, \"Don't eat meat.\" It there may be nutritional standards. And USDA does have nutritional standards that it advises people to adhere to. But what the government is doing here is facilitating a situation, facilitating promotion of a commodity. There is a structural defect in a market like a market for a fungible commodity, and I think it's important to understand what Congress was responding to here. When you have a fungible commodity, when you have a lot of small producers, no one of those producers has an incentive to advertise  \n Mr. Kneedler, is meat fungible? Or I think there are some steak houses that might disagree with that.\n Well, there are there are there are, to be sure, different cuts of meat, but the but the basic  \n I mean, even quality of meat within the some is tougher than others.\n Well  \n It's not like milk or wheat.\n But Congress could reasonably determine, under this statute, that there are that there are that beef has many things in common, that it is a generic problem or generic food or generic commodity, and the industry  \n At some level, it certainly is, I suppose. But, just as in wheat or corn, there are different brands and different qualities. But I suppose it's still fungible, in a broad sense.\n It is fungible in  \n May I ask you whether, in deciding the government's speech doctrine, is it the Secretary's formal right to control, as set out in the statute, that we look to, or do we look to the Secretary's actual record of oversight and participation?\n We think the we think the formal legal control is sufficient. And it the Secretary has the responsibility to approve under the statute to approve budgets, to approve contracts, and to approve projects. And USDA does, in fact, go beyond that and determine whether particular advertisements will be will be issued. But we think it's only necessary to look what the statute requires. But the testimony in this case shows that, in any event, USDA is extensively involved in the development of the advertising under this statute, by extensive consultations with the Operating Committee and the Beef Board in the development of the project. So there this is an integrated effort within the Department of Agriculture.\n Is it at all possible to do here what has been done in the union cases, where I mean, it's pretty hard for me to believe that there aren't that meat that cattle growers don't, by and large, like beef. I mean, maybe they have a ideological objection to people eating beef, but I doubt it. They probably object to some content. So can you segregate that? I mean, in the union cases, the bar cases, they try to segregate where there really is an ideological objection from the cases where really all that the objector wants is not to pay the money. And so they work out a system. You know, you pay so much for your dues anyway, you just don't pay that pro rata amount, where you really have an ideological objection.\n Well, I think that  \n Is it possible to work that out?\n What has what has been proposed by the by the Respondents in this case, of course, is to make it voluntary, so that people  \n Yes, but, I mean, if you make it  \n can opt out.\n totally voluntary, what you're going to discover is, all of a sudden, the beef people, rather than write a check, will say, \"Oh, you know, I make I raise cattle, but I don't think people should eat beef.\"\n Well  \n That saves them the money.\n Well, and I  \n And I tend to doubt that that's their view.\n Well, and  \n Some may view object to certain content. So I'm asking if it's feasible to work out  \n I think it I think it would not be feasible. It would it would enmesh the Department in difficult judgments and time-consuming  \n It would be in the union cases, it's hard enough. It's a the good-of-the-order exception is the way it works in the union. And in the bar thing, I think it would be hard to  \n Absolutely. And the Court made a similar point in Southworth, where it specifically declined to impose, on the university, a requirement to make judgments that would enable people to opt out in particular cases. And we think that the problem here would be even greater. But they would be particularly great under Respondents' proposal that individuals who don't want to pay, without even having to express an objection, because the whole system would collapse. This is a classic collective-action, free-rider problem.\n Mr. Kneedler  \n What the numbers  \n can I come back to Rust versus Sullivan? You say that that was a government speech case? I had not recollected it as a government speech case.\n This Court  \n This is government subsidizing speech by private organizations, and it chose to subsidize one type of speech, but not another.\n Yes  \n Did we say, in the opinion, that this was  \n Not in Rust, but in the Court's subsequent cases, Rosenberger, Southworth in particular, in Velazquez this Court said that Rust has come to be understood by the Court as a government speech case, because the government prescribed the message, and it's government speech whether or not the government speaks for itself or enlists others to transmit the message.\n Well, for the precise purpose at issue here, I think it makes a lot of difference. You can fund private people for some things, and not fund them for others, and it doesn't make whatever they say government speech. I think that's a  \n But  \n I think that's a really  \n but there's really no  \n strong proposition, that whenever you're subsidizing any private enterprise, the speech of that private enterprise becomes public speech.\n There's really no need to get to that point here, because the Beef Board, which is the entity that does the speaking, is, I think, unquestionably a government body. It's established by special statute under the Lebron test. All of its members are appointed by the  \n That's fine. But what you were using Rust for was to establish the proposition that in order to be government speech, it you don't have to you don't have to say, \"This is the government speaking.\"\n Well, I think  \n And Rust doesn't stand for that.\n Right I think, as this Court has come to explain Rust, as being a species of government speech but, as I say, there is no need there is no need for the Court to get to that situation. And the fact that the government is the one in control of the speech here critically distinguished distinguishes this case from cases like Keller and Abood.\n This is a question perhaps more for the Respondent than for you, but I would like your comment on it. Suppose the statute were changed and there was a dollar-a-head assessment on beef, and it just went into the general funds of the United States Treasury, and then they used part of that money they had more money for beef advertising, and the government did the advertising. What would the Respondents say about that?\n I think I think they would say that that that there's something different about general taxes and excise taxes or focus taxes. But I don't think there's any basis in this  \n But why can't  \n in history or  \n why can't you just do that? Or is your answer to me, \"Well, then, it's just formalism, and you might as well rule for me now?\"\n I'm sorry, do maybe I misunderstood your question.\n Why can't the government  \n Were you asking why focus  \n why can't the government adopt my solution?\n Well, I and maybe I misunderstood. Was it was it paying for it out of general taxes or taking this money and putting into the focus  \n It's put into the general fund of the of the Treasury.\n I they may say that that's the same thing, but I they were drawing a distinction between paying for it out of general funds income tax or something that we all would pay for. They say that's the solution, rather than having the industry, that benefits from the advertising, pay for it. Not only does the industry benefit  \n But then you'd come within the protections of Frothingham versus Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon, if you did it that way.\n Yes, there would be standing objection objections at that point, but we think, in terms of the merits of the argument, the notion that a person would have a First Amendment objection to paying an excise tax because of the uses to which the excise taxes are being put is really extraordinary and finds no basis in cases like Abood and Keller, which have to do with private association an association with private speech  \n But then you could  \n no government speech.\n simply restructure this Act to get to the result you want.\n Yes. If that but the funds that are raised are public monies. They don't go in they're not deposited in the Treasury. But in the Joint Appendix, there is a reproduced an AMS, Agricultural Marketing Service, circular that explains how these public monies and calls them \"public monies\" are to be disposed of. And it describes the Beef Board, this governmental body that receives the money, as being the custodian for the Agricultural Marketing Service and handling these monies. And Congress and the Secretary have imposed strict limitations on how those funds can be deposited. So whether they go into the general Treasury or whether they're handled in this way is really a matter of fiscal and revenue and internal governmental policy that I don't think that  \n Mr. Kneedler, this theory is one that wasn't brought up at all in Wileman, if I remember correctly. And in United Foods, it was brought up too late, so the government so the Court didn't entertain it. The argument that you're making today, I take it, would necessarily displace United Foods as having any kind of a continuing  \n Yes, because the government did not reach the government speech or the Court did not reach the government speech argument in United Foods. And, in fact, United Foods is back, on remand. That was a reversal of summary judgment for the government. It's back, on remand, and is being stayed, pending the outcome of this case on government speech. So there would not be an inconsistent result in  \n You wouldn't want to treat beef and mushrooms inconsistently. [Laughter.]\n Well  \n But there is  \n I think  \n the public perception of these ads it says, \"Eat meat\" it's quite different from saying, \"Your government wants you to buy meat.\" And the United States isn't saying that. So  \n But what the what the United States is doing is responding to this classic collective-action problem by establishing a government program to meet the situation where the industry, itself, will is unable to conduct the advertising because of because of, what I said, the fungibility of the product  \n But then  \n and all.\n isn't it more realistic to describe this as the government facilitating the private speech of the many people in this industry who don't have a big budget to advertise on  \n I think  \n on their own?\n doctrinally, it is government speech. It has the it has the benefit of enabling the promotion that would have happened in the industry, but for the collective-action problem to occur. But it is government speech under this Court's decision. If I may  \n Do you want to save your time?\n Please.\n Mr. Garre.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The First Amendment does not prevent the government from speaking out in order to revive and expand the market for the nation's most important agricultural product.\n If we can just continue on government speech, because that's where  \n Yes.\n where we left off. It seems to me there is something offensive about making a particular portion of the public pay for something that the government says.\n Justice Kennedy  \n It ought to be out of the general fund.\n Justice Kennedy, the assessments in this case are imposed on a class of people who sell particular commodity cattle. In that respect, they're no different than the types of assessments the Federal Government has been imposing for centuries on the same of commodities, from the first tax the Federal Government imposed on whiskey to the excise taxes on gasoline producers today. And Respondents concede you could do this out of general tax revenues. They concede that you could have a government speech program funded by excises on certain commodities, like cigarettes or alcohol. There is no basis under the First Amendment to carve out a different rule in the case of beef.\n What I'm saying, it seems to me that the government speech doesn't seem to me to advance your argument very much, because it has problems of its own.\n Well, we agree with the government speech doctrine, although we also think that the Court can uphold the statute under the intermediate-scrutiny analysis. It makes perfect sense for the government to be speaking out in order to correct the market problem that Congress identified in the midst of a two-decades-long depression in the beef industry. Take the BSE incident last year. BSE imposes a potentially catastrophic and overnight impact on the beef industry. In response to that threat, because of the beef checkoff program, the government was able to respond immediately with the funds necessary to respond on a national scale, not only through promotion and this is an important part in which this case is different from United Food only about half of every checkoff dollar goes to promoting beef through commercial advertising, like the \"Beef, it's what's for dinner\" campaign. The rest of that dollar goes to things like producing information to consumers about the safety of U.S. meat, the addressing the health concerns imposed by BSE and other potential diseases, like E. coli; going to open up foreign markets so that we can export beef beef exports have risen dramatically under this program and going for things like research in order to identify an early-detection system for BSE. In United Foods, this Court emphasized, at least three times throughout its opinion, that the only aspect of the program that was the dollar was being collected for was commercial advertising. And, Justice Stevens, I think you emphasized that in your concurrence, as well. And this program is much more holistic  \n Yes, but, I mean, that the part that's good can't save the whole thing, any more than in the in the union case, the fact that some the union dues could be used for some permissible purposes, saved the dues that were being used for impermissible purposes. You  \n Well, the union  \n You don't want to just save half of this program, do you?\n Well, certainly saving half is better than scuttling the whole  \n Oh, all right.\n thing, Justice Scalia. But the union case is the speech that was that this Court held could not be funded and, after all, in those cases, the message was controlled by a non-government entity, the union or the state bar. But there, you're talking about political and ideological speech. Here, we're talking about beef production producing  \n Well, what's the objection to, whenever you have an ad, you put a little thing in the corner, and it says, \"This advertisement is paid for by the beef industry under a regulation, X-23, of the Department of Agriculture\"?\n Justice Breyer, the program would do that if this Court held it was necessary  \n And it wouldn't  \n under the First Amendment.\n tough, would it?\n But  \n All you'd have to do is have a little thing and it would just say, \"USDA requires this, under the program,\" and then the whole problem goes away.\n That's correct. But let me make a few additional  \n All right.\n points. First, as Mr. Kneedler emphasized, nothing in the statute, the regulation, requires the ad to say that they're funded by America's beef  \n Well, I we realize that. I mean, we're getting into it because there's at least a potential constitutional problem here.\n And let me make another  \n As you respond to Justice Breyer's question, would you go the step further and say, Why isn't one possible solution to this difficulty we're having about government speech a requirement that if you want to justify it as government speech, you put in the advertisement, \"This is the government's position, paid for by the beef producers\"?\n The government isn't hiding from  \n No  \n the messages in its pro-beef ads. It Justice Souter, the government could do that, but it's not hiding from this message. We think that if the Court  \n It seems to be. In fact, there was an indication in the brief that the government had taken the position that if the government came out front and said, \"Hey, we're urging you to eat more meat,\" that, in fact, it would be very unsuccessful in doing it. It seems to want to hide the ball here.\n Well, the government does do that, Justice Souter. Last year, during the height of BSE crisis, the President, from his ranch in Texas, urged Americans to eat more beef and told Americans that beef was safe. That's the same message that went out, supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture, through the Beef Board, to communicate  \n Did he  \n message.\n And who paid for that? Did these people pay for that?\n The President's message was paid through general tax dollars. The message under this program is paid through the assessment. It's the same message. The message under the Beef Board is carefully controlled and supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture. If I could make a point  \n Well, let's be honest about it. Let's be totally accurate. It's not going to say, \"The government believes this.\" The government may not believe it. What it says is, \"This message is brought to you by the Beef Association under the under a program requiring contributions to advertising of the Department of Agriculture.\"\n And  \n Nobody will even know what that means, but it has the [Laughter.]\n it has  \n Well, that's good.\n it has the virtue of being totally accurate.\n That's right. Every single ad that we're aware of, has the beef check, which is the sign that the beef or the reasonable observer would know that this is a statute passed by Congress containing a message that Americans should eat more beef, that beef is nutritious, that's disseminated under a program that's carefully supervised and controlled by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n The important thing is, you have no objection to doing that.\n We would not, but we also think and if the Court made that clear in this case, it wouldn't be a basis for invalidating the statute; it might be a basis for sending it back or an as-applied challenge. Importantly, we  \n But what it what it would what it would be a basis for, at least within the confines of this argument, would be a basis for your government speech claim in the sense that you wouldn't be basing a government speech claim on what is really a misrepresentation.\n It we don't think it's a misrepresentation. The speech is funded by America's beef producers. The Respondents in this case, the centerpiece of their First Amendment argument  \n No, including those who don't want to fund it and who don't agree with the message. I mean, the problem here is that by making that representation, you indicate that this is the message of the people who are paying for it. And some of the people who are paying for it do not wish to convey that message.\n We  \n That's the misrepresentation.\n With respect, we would disagree. There's no reason to believe that a reasonable observer would think that just because an ad says it's funded by the nation's beef producers, every single one of the 850,000 individual cattle producers in this country agrees with every single statement  \n But what they would  \n of the message.\n what they would, I think, assume is that, in the name, the beef producers do, in fact, agree with this, and this is their message. What they would not assume from it is that it is what you and Mr. Kneedler are claiming, the speech of the Government of the United States. They certainly wouldn't infer that.\n We think it's fair to assume, as the Court would under the establishment clause, that they're familiar with the act of Congress that makes it its message as well as a program. A critical point on this attribution argument is that it's not supported by any single piece of evidence that Respondents, themselves, have put into the record in this case. Their First Amendment objection is to the content of the ads. There's not a single piece of evidence in the record purporting to make this attribution argument that the public would attribute to the ads to them. It's not in the complaint in this case, it's not in their own affidavits, it's not in the  \n Well, maybe  \n in the  \n maybe it's not because they didn't know you were going to be defending on the basis of government speech. That's what's getting us into this.\n Well, I highly doubt that, Justice Souter, because the First Amendment claim was added in response to the United Foods case, and this case was developed, from the outset, on a government speech theory.\n Which wasn't a government speech case.\n But it the case was tried under the First Amendment, under a government speech argument. But so the fact that Respondents didn't put  \n This case, not United Foods. Because United Foods, the Court said it it was not legitimately before us.\n That's correct. But my point is that the First Amendment case proceeded after United Foods. The government's central argument in the trial was government speech. The one time attribution came up and this is at pages 46 and 47 of the trial record Respondents' own witness testified that the public was not likely to attribute the message of the pro-beef ad to its organization of beef producers. So if the Court finds that attribution is a constitutional concern, it's no basis to bring down the act of Congress on the record in this case. The I want to emphasize, if I could, that the program in this case has been effective. The record establishes that the beef checkoff has had a statistically significant impact on increasing consumer demand for beef and an increase in prices. That's contained in the expert testimony of Professor Ward, at pages 100 and 173. The record also shows that for every checkoff dollar spent on the program, there's more than a 5.67 rate of return back to the beef producers in the form of increased prices for cattle. The Beef Board's 2003 report suggests finds that the price of a fed steer increased by more than $200 in the past few years. This program has worked. Thank you very much.\n Thank you. Mr. Tribe.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: As I was listening to some of the questions about whether it would solve the problem to be more candid and say, \"This is your government speaking,\" I thought I would begin with that question, rather than with an overview of government speech. You'll recall Wooley v. Maynard, of course, in which the State of New Hampshire, without sensing the irony of its position, said, \"We'll put you in jail if you do not say, 'Live Free or Die' on\"  \n But that was  \n \"your license plates.\"\n that was an individual attribution. You, yourself, had  \n Yes.\n had to carry this message. Now, here you want us to think of some cowboy  \n Well  \n going into the bar, and he gets jeered by all his friends because he likes beef.\n Well, Justice Kennedy, my [Laughter.]\n my point my point was going to be that a footnote on the license plate saying, \"This is New Hampshire speaking,\" would not have helped. But one of the central holdings, as I understood it, of United Foods, independent of government speech, was that although there is a difference between having to say something yourself, having to put it on your car, and having to pay for it, that difference does not go to the existence of a First Amendment speech objection not an association objection, but a speech objection.\n Let's first address the question you said you said you were going to address, whether in order to be government speech, within the meaning of our cases, it has to be identified as such. Is that really true? I mean, you know, in World War II, Bob Hope would appear in movie theaters and say, you know, \"Buy war bonds?\"\n Yes, I don't  \n \"This is Bob Hope. You people ought to go out now\"  \n Justice Scalia, I think, although it's an interesting digression about whether the government is being candid, the objection here has nothing to do with that.\n Okay, so it is  \n But being the government  \n it is not essential  \n It may be.\n that government might in order to be government speech, the government does not have to identify itself as the speaker.\n I  \n Yes or no? Yes or no?\n I think the answer is yes, it must identify itself, but it doesn't help, because  \n Well, it doesn't  \n the government  \n we understand that you have a First Amendment claim, which you're going to have even if we say, \"This is not government speech.\" I think the whole point here is to decide whether this is even  \n No, no, Justice  \n an issue that should be disposed of on any grounds other than candor.\n Justice Souter, I think that we're getting off track by assuming that it helps for it to be government speech. My point is that a central theme of this  \n Well, just indulge us. I mean, some of us think it makes  \n Let me  \n a difference  \n Well, but  \n and I would  \n but let me ask you whether  \n I would like to know whether it is essential to its character as government speech that the government's say, \"This your government speaking.\"\n It depends on the purpose for which you are acting whether it's government speech. In Rust v. Sullivan, even though I think you're certainly right, Justice Scalia, that in that opinion it wasn't called government speech, in order to rationalize it, in Rosenberger and Velazquez, it was so described. But the question there wasn't, \"Can people be made to support it?\" The question, rather, was, \"Can the government insist on staying within the terms of its grants and saying you can't talk about abortion?\" When the question is, \"Can the government force you to support it,\" the \"it,\" if it's government speech, doesn't help. The First Amendment makes it a harder case for them, not easier.\n It does it all the time in general taxes. Every  \n Well  \n time we pay general taxes, we're supporting government speech  \n Of course.\n we may not agree with.\n But the Court has said there is a fundamental difference between being singled out, as in Wooley, to have a license plate, as in Pruneyard, to have someone on your premises. In Pruneyard, the Court said that one of the reasons it's okay to require someone to allow a private speaker onto the premises is that he was not required to support a government slogan. When it is  \n Yes, but there it  \n government speech  \n there it is your car, your property. That's not this. This is a generic ad on behalf of beef.\n That was true of  \n I think there is  \n that was true of United Foods.\n there's a world of difference between this and having something put on your license plate or in your  \n Justice O'Connor, I would be much more offended by having to put it in my license plate. But if I were raising cattle, and I were told, as they were told in this case, \"cattle equals beef; that's all it's worth, and that's why we won't let you, in these ads we won't let the ads, that you have to pay for, increase the demands for cattle; only beef\"  \n Well, I don't even understand your argument. Would you still be if the  \n I haven't made it.\n Well, you're trying. [Laughter.]\n Would you still be here if there were distinctions made on behalf of free-range beef or, you know, \"Our cattle\"  \n Oh, yes.\n \"never had a\"  \n The most important distinction  \n \"medicine\" or something like that? Would you still be here if those distinctions  \n Well, if it  \n had been made?\n wasn't generic there's no way for them to have an ad for every imaginable different kind of cattle in one set of advertisements. I just think  \n Well, I'm just  \n it's a  \n asking you if, theoretically, some attention had been paid to the different kinds of producers  \n Right.\n would you still be objecting?\n We would object, fundamentally, if they did not emphasize American beef. That was our first objection. They said that they don't want to emphasize American beef, because, in cross-examination, the officer of the Beef Board said, \"Consumers might actually have a preference for American beef. That would be irrational. We don't want that.\" And so all of those cattle ranchers can say that, \"We're proud of it being American.\" They can't get that in there. And the other principal thing is that they don't think of themselves as selling sides of beef. Some of them are selling dairy cattle, some of them are selling even if it's going to, in the end, be in the slaughterhouse we all die someday their fundamental belief is that these are animals, and they're to be cared for. And the reason that that makes a difference the reason that it makes a difference that they can't even advertise try to make live cattle more attractive to buy is that the collective-action problem, if that were relevant here I think that was really resolved by United Foods but the collective-action problem is really created, not solved, by what they're doing. Because the structure of the market is that there are a few concentrated meat-packers. Something like four slaughter 80 percent of the of the cattle in the United States. They have the bargaining power. And in the record, their support for the findings of the District Court, that when the demand for beef goes up through these generic ads saying, \"Eat beef\" although they certainly don't say, \"Your government says you should eat beef, beef, beef\" but when the demand for beef goes up, the profit is pocketed by the meat processor, the meat packer, the restaurant, the supermarket. And these guys still end up taking their cattle to market, and often having to pay a dollar checkoff, even though they can't even get the price of the of the cattle back. So  \n But would it  \n the free rides are now taken by the people who don't pay  \n seems to  \n the processors don't pay anything.\n I understand that a person could have an ideological objection to the content of the ad. But the ad, itself, is an effort by government, in this area, to regulate a commercial matter, not a license plate that says, \"Free Speech, or Die,\" or \"Freedom\"  \n But it regulates speech, Justice Breyer.\n Yes, I know. Right now I'm asking  \n They don't  \n Well, my question is, does it make a difference for the point of distinguishing, or not distinguishing, \"Live Free, or Die,\" and similar ideological matters does it make a difference that the fundamental aim of the program, and 99 percent of the way it's carried out, has to do with simple advertising, commercial advertising, the regulation of a commercial matter, commerce  \n Right.\n does that make a difference?\n I think it makes an emotional difference.\n But no legal difference.\n Not in the context of forcing people to pay.\n So, in other words  \n It makes a difference  \n in other words, a program that is a regulatory program regulating commerce, we should no longer think of that, though we tend to think of it as quite different in the way we approach the First Amendment we no longer, in your view, should?\n No, no. I think, certainly if we are regulating economic transactions and only dealing with speech in a purely ancillary way that is, we're regulating sale, transactions  \n We regulate advertising. We regulate commercial advertising.\n Right, but the  \n The Federal Trade Commission  \n network  \n Yes.\n didn't you say that just the fact that you call it commercial speech only means that when you are regulating problems of a transactional kind deception, overbearing then the fact that it's commercial speech makes a big difference. But you can't just generically say that because something doesn't fit your idea of what's ideological I mean, to these ranchers, the ideology  \n I didn't say  \n is different  \n I didn't say they had a  \n But whose  \n commercial objection.\n whose line whose line between ideology and commerce will  \n I am asking. In analyzing the program, there are some things for it, and there are some things against it. And in trying to make that weighing, I do think it's different, because the basis of the program is commercial regulation. And so I want to be certain, in your view, that's either correct or incorrect.\n I think it's  \n If it's incorrect, I want to know why.\n Well, I think it's if one were just weighing and didn't have a structured set of principles on the balance in favor of it, I think, you're right, we can't they're not trying to induce ideological conformity. This is not a case where they're trying to enforce what Justice Jackson calls \"the unanimity of the graveyard.\" It is a case where the spirit of the government is in the right place. The government is trying to facilitate collective speech when  \n Well, if it makes a difference, then the lens that I look at this through is called our whatever the second-tier commercial speech lends.\n I don't think  \n Have you looked at  \n That doesn't follow. I don't think that follows. It follows that if you were if you were writing on a clean slate and were trying to create a wholly new doctrine, one of the things you would look at, I suppose, is that this is not a program designed to create ideological conformity in America. At least the spirit of the program is not that. But the road to hell is often paved with good intentions, and the means, in this case, that was chosen, was not to have the government spend some more money telling people, \"Beef isn't all as bad for you as you think.\" The remedy that they are choosing is to pick a group of ranchers and say to them, \"You are the ones who are going to pay, and you are going to pay for\"  \n Mr. Tribe, would  \n \"ads that are in your name.\"\n would you comment on the argument that what will this do to compelling cigarette manufacturers to finance the advertisements against smoking?\n Well, by \"advertisements against smoking,\" Justice Stevens, if you mean, \"Here are the things that will kill you in cigarettes,\" the kind of thing that's on the package now, it seems to me that it is constitutional, under even cases like Zauderer, to say that whoever sells a product or a service  \n They have to give warning. But why is the why is the cigarette analogy different from this case? What is your answer to that?\n Well, it seems to me that no one suggests that the cigarette companies are supporting the ads in California. California is doing exactly what the Surgeon General does.\n Well, it's odd that you can be compelled to  \n Say negative things  \n engage in speech that you don't agree with. Now you're saying that the more  \n Right.\n disagreeable it is to you  \n Well  \n the more legitimate it is. That's  \n I think if you're  \n a very strange argument.\n Well, it may be strange, but I think that there have been stranger things. The reason that it's true is that if you go around doing things that might endanger people, it's entirely justifiable for the state, as part of its non-speech effort to protect people  \n Well, do you  \n from harm, to make you give warnings  \n do you accept the fact that the government can charge taxes on the sale of cigarettes and compel and use that money to tell people that they're dangerous?\n Well, I think that's a much harder case than this, to be honest with you. I think  \n We do, however.\n Well, California does that.\n Is that part of what's going on?\n In California, it does.\n So what you're arguing here  \n Yes.\n is going to have rather a drastic effect on  \n Well, I think the  \n what's going on.\n drastic effect would be the other way, wouldn't it? If this Court were to hold, despite United Foods, that it is permissible to force people to support speech they don't agree with, as long as that speech doesn't fit our sense of what's ideological, that cuts to roll back Keller and Lehnert and Abood. It's not a small part of the constitutional landscape that would be unearthed. Whereas, think about what is the marginal effect of saying  \n Wait, I don't I had not understood you to be arguing, Professor Tribe, that this would be unlawful, even if the money were raised in the fashion that it is, just from the just from the cattlemen. And the government's own program used that money to say, \"Your government thinks it's wants you to know that beef is thoroughly safe. We've done studies. Beef is good for you. You should eat more beef.\" I thought you  \n No, I do think that would be permissible.\n That would be permissible?\n Because, I mean, technically, it would solve only the association problem. They're not associated with the message. They're still forced to support it, but not in any sense different from general taxpayers. And because that's the case, and because it would be an odd formalism to say that it makes a difference whether we segregate that money or not, seems to me it would follow that if the government is willing to pay the political cost of having the speech be perhaps less persuasive because of people's discount for what the government says and of having to get an appropriation from the taxpayers I mean, taxpayers are smart enough to know  \n No, not that. The same program, but you just have a little tag on the ad.\n Like the lockbox? I mean, every I think the taxpayers know that money is fungible. Well, in this case, you mean if you had the program, not from general revenue, but you simply said, on the ad, \"This is actually part of a government program\"? I don't think that solves any problem, other than deception.\n What's the  \n Deception is the my constitutional argument.\n what's the difference between the checkoff and the excise tax?\n Well, the checkoff in this case is money that goes to a group, which, though it is organized by the government, purports to represent  \n So the answer is  \n the way it structured  \n where  \n these people.\n where the money goes and who pays out the money for the ad, that's the difference.\n Well, the difference is the whole structure. Keep in mind  \n Well, isn't that the isn't that the essential difference between the structure in this case and the structure in the case in which the government comes out, saying, \"This is your government, saying, 'Don't smoke.'\"\n Yes, one the difference is that in one case, we've got Congress, we've got the executive, we have one  \n Right.\n person, one vote. Here, we have a million  \n I know, but take all that out of it take all that out of it, and what is your answer to Justice Stevens and Justice Souter? That is, look, like this, you have an organization, the Federal Trade Commission, say, or that the FDA says, on the one hand, (a) broccoli industry, \"Fruits and vegetables are good for you; crib death device, \"Buy anti-crib-death devices; \"Buy car seats for your children\"; or, \"Don't smoke\"; or  \n Well, I mean  \n \"Don't buy a crib without a crib-death device\"  \n I mean, I think it's  \n \"or a car without a car seat.\"\n Right.\n See? One's negative and one's positive. And everything else is the same. Then how do you  \n Whether it's  \n what's the difference?\n negative  \n Yes.\n or positive, it's the government  \n Okay, maybe it doesn't matter.\n Well, no, it matters, in this sense. When the government puts out a message and puts its credibility behind the message, likely to have to balance it's going to say, \"A little broccoli, but a little steak.\" \"Don't risk crib death\"  \n But I'm not interested I got that point.\n Right.\n I'm not dismissing it. I understand it.\n All right.\n But I'm not sure  \n So I'm not understanding what your question is.\n Well, my question is, is it implied in what you're argued that it would be equally unconstitutional, in the same way, to tell the cigarette industry to advertise, \"Don't smoke,\" or to tell the automobile industry to advertise, \"Buy car seats for your children,\" or to tell the crib industry to advertise, \"Be sure you have an anti-crib-death device\"?\n I think  \n And all that, assuming the financing is the same as here, everything else the same, is it implicit in your argument that they're all equally unlawful?\n No. My argument is that you can require the seller of any commodity to include warnings. It does not necessarily follow that you can say to an industry, \"You're bad guys. We want you to put on an advertising campaign, and the campaign has to have these characteristics.\" Forcing them to advocate that people not buy their products, I think, is not the same thing  \n Mr. Tribe  \n as forcing them to say  \n I thought  \n that it will be addictive or that it will cause cancer.\n But you're saying  \n I thought  \n I want to be sure I that I understood your answer. You can compel them to make warnings. Can you compel them to pay for warnings that are just industry-specific, in saying, \"This is dangerous\"  \n I think so, because I can't see any difference between saying that you put on the package, \"The Surgeon General has determined that smoking will cause cancer,\" and saying, \"We're going to put on television\"  \n But it seems  \n \"the Surgeon General\"  \n almost ironic, to me, to say that you have a greater power to tell the whole industry to publish something they don't want to publish than you do to let them  \n But that Justice Stevens, what  \n pay for what  \n what is  \n 90 percent of them want to say.\n what is the difference between telling them that I mean, there may be a critical difference between the point of sale and a generic ad that is, the power to regulate the transaction to make sure it's safe, includes the power to include on the package certain warnings. The moment you step back from that and say that, \"Because you're in a dangerous business, you have to publish general warnings to the public,\" maybe that's where the line has to be drawn, because I agree that it would be rather bizarre  \n Are you limiting your point to putting information on the package, or are you saying they could could California compel a cigarette companies to contribute to a large fund which is just used to by newspaper advertising describing the dangers of smoking? Could they do that?\n Well, I think that the rationale for that would be far stronger than this. The state's power to protect people, in terms of life and health, includes the power to compel  \n Yes, but supposing there are disagreements. We were you were talking about cigarettes. But supposing there's a legitimate disagreement between the industry position and the government position  \n Okay.\n could the government, nevertheless, insist on the industry financing advertising advocating the government's position?\n Well, not advocating; reporting what the government position is. I mean, the when the cigarette company says on the package, \"The Surgeon General has found this stuff is deadly,\" they're not quite saying, \"We agree with the Surgeon General.\" They've making them fund or support statements that do not reflect their own beliefs, as though it were  \n So, in this case  \n is impermissible.\n I take it, it would be okay if the beef producers had to use a dollar a head to put, \"Eating too much beef is dangerous to your health.\"\n Well, if they had well, they're not beef producers. I mean, I am troubled by they're these are cattle.\n All right, cattle, then  \n All right? And then and then they're trying, ultimately, to brand us as though we are slicing these things up and selling them.\n But what's the answer to my question?\n If the question is, can retail grocers be required to put on the beef packages they sell, \"The government has determined that the cholesterol content is dangerous if you have more than X,\" I see no reason why that would be harder  \n In other words  \n to defend than the cigarette package.\n I think the question, or at least the version I have of it  \n Yes.\n is, we have this case, exactly, and the only difference is, instead of getting these people to eat say, \"Eat beef,\" what they say do is, they get people together and say, \"Don't eat too much beef.\" I put  \n Well  \n \"too much,\" because that  \n Yes.\n makes it more realistic. All right, now, does it suddenly become constitutional?\n The program is facially unconstitutional. It is the structure that says to all these people, \"You've got to put money into this elaborate structure, which purports to represent you\" that is, the they have all this stuff saying that the Beef Board is related to the industry as board of directors, the shareholders \"These people, who purport to represent you, will, under the aegis of the government, put out statements at various times.\" That's facially unconstitutional.\n All right. Consider this theory. The Congress passes an excise tax. It happens to be a dollar head, on the cattle, just like this so-called \"checkoff.\" And the government uses the excise tax revenue to finance advertising, saying maybe saying, \"Eat more beef,\" maybe advertising, saying, \"Don't eat quite so much.\"\n Or maybe  \n First Amendment problem  \n talking about the war in Iraq. No, I think that once your taxes enter the general fund, a pretense that it's  \n Including excise?\n Well, I don't think excise taxes are segregated in any way that makes that makes it harder  \n No, I just want to know what  \n than Social Security.\n your position is. I just want to know what your position is.\n My position is that once the revenue is part of the government's general fund, the government's subject to doctrines that I don't think are First Amendment doctrines about government propaganda there may be limits on the government's ability  \n Okay, then  \n to defend it.\n He's just going back to  \n Subject to that  \n Okay, then it does not have  \n it's not a First Amendment problem.\n it's not a First Amendment problem. It does not have the objection that you're raising.\n That's correct.\n Okay.\n Is that is that an answer to the question that Justice Kennedy urged in the opening argument? That is, it's the same dollar a head, except you call it an excise tax instead of a whatever this is called. The same thing, but to say it's a tax. And you're not this is not general revenues that you collect from everybody and spend  \n If the structure is they take the money from you and put it in this elaborate machinery which comes out with statements you're forced to support, the statements that don't have behind them the accountability checks of the Federal Government, which has to answer to taxpayers and answer to the public for the stuff it puts out that is if that's what it is, it doesn't matter what you call it, it remains unconstitutional. It remains unconstitutional because these individuals are forced in a way that taxpayers are not forced to be part of a system in which, even if you have footnotes saying, \"This is pursuant to the government,\" a system in which they will be generally understood in just the way Justice Breyer said, \"Well, you know, we assume\"  \n But suppose  \n that these people  \n we don't have that? I mean, could then could the government fix this problem this way, saying, \"We're going to get the same bucks, but we are going and we're going to have the same kinds of ads, but they're going to be labeled, 'U.S. Department of Agriculture.\"\n And we're going to eliminate the cattlemen's Beef Board and all of these things  \n Yes.\n that are supposed to represent you  \n But we are but where this money is coming from to pay this is  \n I would be happy to represent the cattlemen in that circumstance, saying, \"You still have not an associational right, but a right not to be singled out to support government speech.\" But it would be a different and more difficult claim. One. Two, this Court doesn't have before it the possibility of rewriting all of this. Three, there was a severability provision in an earlier version of the law suggesting that maybe if you could lop something off, it would be okay. But that was eliminated in the current law. And, finally, any attempts to analogize this to the cases like Lehnert and Keller, in terms of remedy, that maybe we can create some scheme where only the objectionable part is returned, is fundamentally incoherent, because what is objectionable here is homogenizing all of these people into some one message, and putting it out through this elaborate structure that purports to represent them.\n May I go back to one of your reasons, which was that they are being singled out to pay for this? They're being singled out to pay for it in the excise tax situation. Do you come to different answers, depending whether it's excise tax or singled out without excise tax, based, essentially, on the ground that there is a point beyond which we simply cannot look behind the expenditure of tax revenue? Is that it?\n I think that there's a point beyond which, for institutional reasons, it would be very problematic for a courts to say that you could trace the dollars into the treasury and those institutional reasons would be, I think, an instance of under-enforcement of a constitutional norm, because the underlying constitutional principle that you ought not to be able, by some gimmick, to get some people to support speech they don't believe in, that would be there. But the difficulty of having this Court enforce that principle, I think, would be very real. But no such difficulty, I think, is presented in a case like this one, because if this case came out their way because of government speech, of course, United Foods would be obliterated, but a good deal more would be obliterated, because the theory would have to be that because it's not on your license plate, because you don't have to carry it, you're only supporting it, then that's all the difference in the world. Because, otherwise, its being government speech would make it worse. But if it's all the difference in the world whether you have to carry or utter it, or merely support it, then all of the decisions of this Court carefully protecting the rights of dissenters in every imaginable kind of organization, from the powerful overriding theory that collective-action problems mean that we've really got to get more speech over here than you are willing, yourselves, to engage in  \n Yes, but on the other hand  \n you'd be  \n you're running into the problem that the taxpayer can be compelled to pay taxes to support activities that he doesn't support at all. That's the other  \n Well, we do that all the time.\n the other extreme. I know we  \n We do that all  \n do it all the time.\n the time.\n And when are we crossing  \n That's the  \n the line?\n that's why we have elections, in part.\n Pardon me?\n Right? We have elections, in part, because the only way there's no way to protect every individual's right to have the government's collective policy suit his or her fancy. I mean, that way  \n But it is  \n would allow complete chaos.\n inconsistent with the basic principle on which you rely, that the individual should not be compelled to support speech  \n Well  \n with which he disagrees.\n to support supporting speech is somewhat different from supporting activities that you don't agree with. I mean, the First Amendment makes a fundamental difference in that respect.\n But isn't  \n If there were  \n isn't that  \n I'm sorry.\n Don't you go back to the answer you gave me? Sure, when taxes are involved, there may be an under-inclusive enforcement of certain individual rights, but they have to be under-enforced, because, otherwise, you simply cannot administer a tax structure.\n Or any structure. I mean, Bowen v. Roy I mean, there's a sympathetic case of the man who did not want Little Bird of the Snow to be given a Social Security number. But we could, when we, interactive with the government, say to him, \"You we can't make you give the number to get the food for your little daughter,\" but if one person says, \"I don't want numbers in your computers,\" and the other says, \"I don't want letters, I want only numbers,\" the fact that every individual who has a potential claim on a collective choice could pull in a different direction means we can't run a system that way. But no such problem is presented in cases like this.\n Thank you, Mr. Tribe.\n Thank you.\n I think we understand your position. Thank you. Mr. Kneedler, you have about three three or four minutes.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens. Mr. Tribe has conceded that if this program were financed by a system of excise taxes that went into the general Treasury, and Congress then paid provided the exact same amount of money to produce the exact same ads, that there would be no constitutional problem. And, in our view, the First Amendment simply does not regulate the details of government fundraising, the details of government accounting, and the details of government bookkeeping in that manner. The First Amendment is  \n But that goes back to Frothingham and Mellon, and Massachusetts versus Mellon, and United States versus Butler, where we could trace the amount.\n Right, and  \n It's old stuff.\n Right, and the Court the Court superceded those decisions in cases like Carmichael Coal and Storaasli Company and cases like that, where the Court said excise taxes can be imposed. As long as there is a public welfare justification, they can be spent. And it would be an odd result to have the First Amendment drive the way the government arranges a system like this. After all and Professor Tribe said it would be different if the cattlemen's Beef Board were gotten rid of. It actually the principal point here is the Secretary controls the speech. Whatever the cattlemen's Beef Board does and that is a government entity the Secretary controls the speech. So that this is not some jury-rigged system; this is a system of governmental control. Congress has prescribed the message, and the Secretary carries it out. It's important to recall that many federal excise taxes go into dedicated trust funds for highways, for other functions like that. And out of that dedicated trust fund, there may be money expended on highway safety. So the fact that it's dedicated really should not matter. And this case is completely different from cases like Keller. In Keller, the state bar was not appointed by the by the government, there was no governmental supervision of what it did, and the government certainly did not approve the messages in favor of nuclear freezes, et cetera. This is different in all the critical ways that make this a program of government speech. And, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to strike down this program would have drastic consequences. There are many, many agricultural promotion programs like this. There are 13 at the national level. This program has been in existence since 1988. One billion dollars has been collected, and promotions have been conducted under it. These promotional programs go back to the '50s, and even and even earlier. And there are many programs on the state levels, as the amicus brief filed by the states in this case shows. This Court would be striking down a lot to hold that this commonsense way of approaching things is unconstitutional. It's also important to recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the advertising is the consumer. Yes, it affects the industry, but it's the consumer. And the very first finding that Congress made in the Beef Act is, beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet. When the when the because of the collective-action problem in this industry, that it cannot organize to advertise, that basic message is not getting to consumers. So this the justifications for this, to the extent one thinks of it in terms of the commercial speech, it is squarely within the ultimate purposes of the commerce speech doctrine, which is to correctly market failure with respect to advertising in order to get information to consumers.\n Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. The case is submitted.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is a challenge to Michigan's $100 per truck flat annual fee that is imposed on all trucks that are registered to do point-to-point operations in the State of Michigan. We submit that this fee, this flat per truck fee, has the same impermissible effects on interstate commerce as the two flat truck fees that were struck down by this Court in American Trucking Associations v. Scheiner. In the American Trucking Associations v. Scheiner case, this Court looked at the practical effect of these fees and found that because of their unapportioned structure, that the fees had four interrelated types of impermissible effects on interstate commerce. First, the Court found that these kinds of flat fees were a financial barrier against out-of-state motor carriers even coming into the State that imposed the the fee. There's no question in this case that the Michigan flat fee has the same kind of protectionist quality.\n Well, it it does for trucks that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan. It doesn't for anybody else.\n Yes, it it discriminates and it it has an exclusory effect on trucks out-of-state carriers that want to compete in the and bring their trucks across the the border of Michigan and compete against local carriers for intrastate hauls.\n It would have that it certainly has that tendency. Do we have do we know in fact what the effect is? Is it deterring anybody? How many trucks does it affect?\n There was not a trial below. So we don't have that fact. We believe that as in the Scheiner case, these these tendencies are inherent there. Because of the structure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has what this Court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and that is to for carriers, once they have paid this fee as an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate commerce and to concentrate them into in the State of Michigan in the local activities. And that in fact, the State acknowledges that. Below, the State said that motor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to the State of Michigan in order to avoid these consequences. And even the Michigan Court of Appeals recognized that, saying a local carrier would be discouraged from operating in interstate commerce.\n Of course, it also I mean, you say it it favors the in-state intrastate carrier because if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage, you you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas the interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of-state, doesn't do that. On the other hand, you can certainly argue that that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers in in another respect, that is to say, interstate carriers who who do nothing within the State do not pay it, whereas the the Michigan carrier that does a lot of interstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate business interstate business, he still pays it. Isn't that right?\n Well, Your Honor, I think what what that's saying and I know that was the argument made in the Solicitor General's brief is that you can discriminate against one component of interstate commerce, those carriers that want to actually compete and do intrastate business in the State, as long as you give a benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those who just wish to operate in the in the State of Michigan in interstate commerce.\n Well, it's not so much that you necessarily can do it, but it it sort of interrupts the the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown back on a on on a practical effects analysis under Pike.\n No, Your Honor. I think what happens is that that there are the segment of carriers that would like to compete against intrastate carriers. The fact that other carriers may be getting a break in terms of regulatory fees and we don't know that to be the truth, getting the other interstate carriers. It's the Boston Stock Exchange, and I think it was said again in the Scheiner case that that you can't discriminate among interstate carriers. And as we pointed out in our brief, you could set up a situation in which a a State discriminated in favor of interstate carriers in situations or industries where their locals had no interest in competing, but where their their locals were interested in competing, they could set up a discriminatory system. So you can protect timber industry in in Oregon and  \n But may I ask this question? Suppose you have an interstate carrier that does 100,000 miles of business in Michigan and you have an intrastate carrier that does a 100,000 miles of business in Michigan. They both say the pay the same tax, don't they?\n If they each do 100,000 miles of intrastate business in Michigan  \n Yes.\n they would pay the same flat fee.\n They would both pay the same tax, both the intra and the interstate. Now, that doesn't sound to me like discrimination against either one.\n If if this if this tax was apportioned based on mileage, it would not be discrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and  \n No, but I'm just saying if the intrastate and interstate carriers both have the same intrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax.\n And we we would and again, if this was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be it would be fine. But the fact is as in Scheiner, the out-of-state carriers, because the interstate carrier is is operating  \n Yes, but you might have an intrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage, only 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays does 100,000 miles. They both pay the same tax too. And everybody is treated alike on their intrastate business.\n That would be true but that  \n And the tax only operates on intrastate business.\n The factual situation is going to be that the interstate carrier is just not going to have the opportunity to do as much business in Michigan as the intrastate carrier.\n Well, it seems to me you should have introduced some evidence on that point. I mean, it it really is an assumption of your unfairness argument that purely intrastate carriers do significantly more intrastate business than interstate carriers who choose to do some interstate business. Now, does that strike you as self-evident? It does not need any  \n Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\n demonstration?\n It does strike me as self-evident. In fact, to courts below we have we've made this argument. We've seen this argument now. The cases have called it intuitively obvious. And from the discussion of in the Scheiner case and from the discussion in the Nippert case, the very difference between interstate and intrastate commerce means that on average the interstate carrier is just not going to use the State's facilities as much as the in-state carrier.\n Wouldn't we be better able to decide this question after a trial rather than speculation on both sides?\n I don't think a trial is necessary because, as I say, this this Court quoted Justice Frankfurter clearly, and I think the Solicitor General in his brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is not going to get as much benefit from this fee. This is a variable cost fee. In effect, the out-of-state carrier is having to pay more than its fair share of the cost of the of the State's regulatory system. And again, that's something that was accepted in the Scheiner case, accepted in in the Nippert case. And the intrastate carrier every time that it operates in the State, it is using that privilege.\n Well, Nippert was over 100 years ago, wasn't it?\n I think the Nippert case was from the 1940's I believe. In any event, as we've been discussing  \n It seems like 100 years ago. (Laughter.)\n It's  \n Mr. Digges, this the the there was a question about the ramifications of the position that you're presenting. That is, there are many situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount, although some people who are licensed will be doing business in other States and have to get licenses there as well. The example that was featured in the in the briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed, say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any break on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also admitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his practice out-of-state, out of the District.\n Yes, Your Honor. I know that that example was given. I think there are a variety of flat fees that would be unaffected by this. There are fees that would be administrative charges and and if all the State is doing is charging, for example, the cost of a background investigation or the cost of a truck inspection, a fixed cost, then it's fair to ask the carrier to pay a fixed fee or to ask the taxpayer to pay a fixed fee. With respect to the bar fees, they are obviously different than the trucking industry and and the taxation of an instrumentality in interstate commerce. But we think that there may be impracticalities in apportioning a bar fee. You could have an attorney in his office in Virginia that is working for a California customer or California client that is being for a case that is being tried in the court system of Oregon, and then for transaction work, he could be working for a customer or a client in in Missouri for a multi-state. So it may be difficult to apportion fees. We haven't really examined that. But we know from this Court's decisions that that is easy and can be apportioned for truck fees, and truck fees this Court said in Scheiner that the technology is now available to look at the extent of the activity and the taxpayer in in of the truck in the State, and later on in a subsequent decision said that you can easily track large physical objects over States. So you can apportion these fees on trucks to their mileage in the State, to their loads, to the gross revenue associated with the  \n The Scheiner case didn't make a distinction based on in-state activity. I thought that that that flat fee was applicable to every motor carrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.\n That is accurate, Your Honor, but but nominally Scheiner for instance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scheiner case did say that did uphold the fee because they said only Pennsylvania could charge for the privilege of using Pennsylvania's highways. So like a lot of like all interstate commerce, you can always as as the Court said in Nippert, you can always find carve out a local activity to say that this is going to be the focus of the tax. I think a problem here is with the the approach taken by the State and the Solicitor General is they suggest that you go back to the days in which you're trying to draw a line between interstate and intrastate activity, this time not because the intrastate activity is going to be immune from the tax, but this time because you're going to have some separate, different kind of test applicable to something that clearly is subject to Commerce Clause protections, but is is, in their view, subject to a more lenient Commerce Clause protection. And I don't think this Court wants to retreat back to the days of having to draw a line between interstate and intrastate commerce and and then having separate tests. If there are no more questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.\n Very well, Mr. Digges. Mr. Hanson.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In contrast to the ATA case, the question before the Court today in the Mid-Con case is whether the fee on vehicles operating solely in interstate commerce is preempted by 49 U.S.C., section 14504.\n It's the same fee we're talking about.\n It is  \n But a different theory of invalidity.\n It is not the same fee. The the fee under subsection (1) that ATA is arguing about is an intrastate fee charged only to  \n Intrastate.\n carriers that engage in intrastate activities.\n Okay, and yours is the interstate fee.\n The subsection (2) fee under 478.1  \n And your fee applies to all Michigan-plated vehicles. Am I correct about that?\n That are operating solely in interstate commerce.\n Yes.\n Do do I understand that the two distinctions in what is done with the or the way the fee is collected and what's done with it is that the the fee is charged against the is it the operator as opposed to the owner, if there is a distinction? Is is that correct?\n All of the fees under subsections (1) and (2) are charged against the motor carrier  \n The carrier.\n or  \n That's the term I should use.\n motor carrier, not to the owner.\n Which may not be the owner. And number two, as I understand it, as distinct from the registration fee, this fee goes to a different State department. Is that right?\n That's correct.\n Now, let that's that's a premise for a question I want to ask you, and the question is in economic effect, is there any difference really between charging this $100 fee with those differences from the registration fee and simply jacking up the registration fee by $100? Would there would there be any economic difference to the to the public or or indeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the the registration fee by $100? Because the the registration fee is passed on to the carrier, if it's not the owner, and the carrier it doesn't make any difference to the carrier whether the whether the State diverts the $100 up front or or divides the the registration fee after it's paid. So is there any economic difference?\n Yes, there is and the reason why there is a difference is that the the fees that are paid for plating are under the under the International Reciprocity Plan, the registration plan, the IRP. And that is an apportioned fee. It is charged to all vehicles, all commercial motor vehicles, regardless of whether it's for-hire or private, regardless of it's in-state or of interstate. So everybody pays their apportioned amount based on mileage.\n No, but that shows that maybe I don't understand. That that tells us what happens to the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make any difference to the person who is paying the money, does it?\n Yes, it does.\n Except that he only has to pay in one place, and and if they  \n He pays  \n increase the registration fee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once.\n But he would only pay the fee based on his mileage in the State. It is not a flat fee if it is put onto the IRP fees. Those  \n Who who sets the fee for the plating?\n The the State does. It is administered by the Michigan Secretary of State  \n So  \n but I believe all of those are statutory fees.\n you could have unlike the the fee, the $10 fee, that  \n The SSRS.\n the Federal cap, this would for plating it could be anything each individual State chooses it to be?\n In terms of the plating fee?\n Yes.\n Each State is free to charge its its own amount as the plating fee.\n Sure, but it so so regardless of what Michigan does with the apportioned amounts, the amount it charges to the to the owner, in the case of the the plating fee, is is simply set by the State of Michigan.\n That is  \n Yes.\n that is correct.\n So what and and the the virtue of the apportionment is that the that the owner or the or the owner, I guess in this case, does not have to pay fees in 49 other States.\n That is correct.\n But he doesn't it doesn't matter to that's the value to him. It doesn't matter to him how they apportion whatever that fee is that Michigan charges.\n If they apportion it, however, it is it is not it does not if they put it into the IRP, it is not part of the registration process. The thing that the  \n But who I mean, is that's that's fine as a matter of administration, but in terms of the the end effect on the person who has to pay it and on the consumers to whom it is ultimately passed on, what difference does it make?\n Well, the the difference for the person who is paying it under IRP is that if only 20 percent of their interstate miles as a solely interstate operating carrier, if only 20 percent are in the State, they would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle.\n Can I ask a quick question? The there are three things. Were were you finished?\n No, I don't think he I didn't  \n Sorry.\n I don't understand your answer. If you were finished, I don't understand.\n Okay.\n If it's if it is put into a plating charge as opposed to a registration part of the registration of a carrier for the privilege or the opportunity to carry on interstate trucking activities in the State of Michigan, that is the flat fee that we're talking about. Under the SSRS we believe that $100 charge exceeds the $10 maximum and is therefore preempted. If they put it into the IRP, that IRP is charged against the owner of the vehicle, paid against the Secretary of paid to the Secretary of State. It is not a qualification under for the privilege of engaging in interstate trucking in the State of Michigan. The SSRS sets up the standards by which a carrier becomes qualified to operate in the State. Michigan exceeds those standards. If you put those fees into the IRP fees, then the carrier or then the owner of the vehicle pays only the proportionate amount based on his mileage in the State.\n May I ask this question? Supposing the Michigan changed its system and said we're going to charge you $90 for as a plating fee. We're only talking about vehicles that are plated in Michigan. We're going to charge you $90 for a plating fee and now we're going to take 10 what used to part of the $100 and another $10 registration fee. Would that be permissible?\n It would be permissible because the if the $10 is charged to the carrier as part of the registration process, in order to be qualified to engage in interstate trucking. The $90 would be charged to the owner of the vehicle and would be paid on an apportioned basis under IRP.\n Okay. What if he said $20 instead of $10?\n If he said $20 was going to be put towards the the State instead of instead of $100?\n Yes.\n And $80 towards IRP?\n Yes.\n In that case, that would still violate the the SSRS, if it is done as part of the registration process, which is what Michigan does. Michigan even though you're properly SSRS registered, Michigan still requires, under its SSRS form it directs the carrier to specifically identify vehicles by make, model, and serial number to obtain a decal by paying $100 for that fee. If they pay $20, that exceeds the $10 maximum that Congress set up in the SSRS in order to be qualified to operate in interstate trucking in the State of Michigan, as an interstate carrier in in Michigan.\n But that that assumes it's an SSRS charge, and the State denies that it it has anything to do with SSRS. Don't you have to establish that it's part of the SSRS program?\n I think what you have to do is you have to look at what the the standards do. The the registration standards in the SSRS are set up as the process by which a carrier has the privilege to enter into interstate trucking activities in Michigan. When you look at the statute  \n Okay, but what what if the State says, you can enter enter into interstate activities for nothing? We're simply going to increase the registration fee by $100. Couldn't the State do that?\n The State could do that and that would be perfectly permissible.\n So this is pure formalism.\n It is not pure form. Any what what Congress did was say that in order to qualify a carrier they were concerned about the burdens. When ISTEA was enacted in 1991, they were concerned about the burdens on carriers of individual State registration requirements. And they sought to to alleviate that by making it so that carriers could only would only have to register in one State so they could do business in all States on an interstate basis.\n Maybe they sought to but maybe they didn't succeed. As I read the statute, it it really applies to the the limitation of $10 only to those fees that are SSRS fees, and these are not. So maybe there's there's a hole in the Federal statute.\n And I don't believe that's the case, Justice Scalia.\n You're trying to make the Federal statute work sensibly, but  \n Right.\n I hate to tell you, but not all statutes work sensibly.\n Right. I think what you have to do, though, is go back and look at what Michigan does. Michigan has a a State statute, 478.7(1), that says in order to operate to carry property on an interstate basis in Michigan, you must register with the PSC and you must pay the required vehicle fees. The registration standards are what they do as in accordance with SSRS: insurance, service of process, and operating authority. Then you have to pay a fee, and the fee is limited to $10 per vehicle. In the case of Michigan, those vehicle fees are set forth in two different sections of the statutes. One is .7(4), which is the $10 SSRS fee. The other one is subsection it's 2(2). That fee is $100  \n Thank you, Mr. Hanson.\n in order for a Michigan-plated vehicle to engage in interstate commerce.\n Your time is expired.\n Thank you.\n Mr. Boynton, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner, American Trucking, began its reply brief with the claim that the central reality in this case is that the Michigan intrastate fee places significant burdens on interstate commerce. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected this claim squarely, saying that as a matter of that that was a matter of pure speculation. There's no evidence in the record before this Court that the trucking companies' route choices are affected by the intrastate fee. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that the intrastate fee keeps anyone out from engaging in intrastate trucking in Michigan.\n It sure does make sense to me, though. Surely it's the case that a company that does nothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by and large, log in many more miles intrastate than a company which does interstate business but part of its business is intrastate Michigan business. I I just it seems to me obvious that  \n Well, the Michigan Court of Appeals said that that very well may be the case, but they pointed to the fact that there were no facts to support that finding. And this is completely different than in Scheiner. In Scheiner you had a a trial, you had evidence before the court. This Court noted that the the cost to an interstate trucker in that situation was five times greater than the cost to a trucker that was in Pennsylvania. You just simply don't have those facts here. What you have is a discrete or a distinct local activity that is something that doesn't affect the interstate commerce.\n It it's the case that a company that does only intrastate Michigan business logs all of its miles on in Michigan. Right? No miles outside of Michigan.\n That's right.\n And it seems to me it's obvious that a a company that does interstate business does not log all of its miles in in Michigan, and likely likely very likely does does less miles in Michigan than than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker.\n Well, Justice Scalia, that very well may be true, but we don't have any way of of qualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't have those facts.\n Is it difficult to apportion the intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled intrastate?\n Well, Your Honor, I I think it is very difficult to do that. As the United States noted in its brief, they didn't think that mileage would be appropriate because this this fee doesn't support the maintenance of the highways. What this fee does is allows trucking companies or allows that truck to operate that truck in intrastate business. So mileage isn't appropriate. Our position is that mileage isn't appropriate because it's next to impossible to try and figure out. What do you compare it to? Do you do you compare it to interstate miles? Do you compare it to a ratio of interstate intrastate to interstate? And if you do that, how how can you come up with a accurate picture of, you know, what the value of that license is in Michigan? It may be  \n Does it make any difference how high the the fee is set? If it were $10,000 a truck, does that raise any concerns that are different?\n Well, Your Honor, the Michigan Court of Appeals had taken the position that this was a fee, not a tax, and under a fee if if a fee was $10,000, if the expenses matched the the revenue from it, well, then it it would be a could be sustained as a fee. Now, if were a tax  \n You you defend that position, that that it doesn't violate the Commerce Clause so long as it's a fee not a tax?\n Your Honor, we think that the if it's a fee and not a tax, the Michigan Court of Appeals applied the correct standard, and that was the standard of Pike v. Bruce Church. And you would look to the whether the statute regulated even-handedly, whether it affected a legitimate local  \n Whenever it's a fee, not a tax, you immediately go to Pike Church.\n I think that that that was what the Michigan Court of Appeals  \n I know. I know that's what they said.\n Yes, and I I think that's a  \n I found it very strange.\n I think that's an appropriate manner in dealing with it. But if you if you look at the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion  \n What makes it a fee instead of a tax other than the court saying so?\n Well, first of all, it provided a direct benefit to the intrastate truckers. They were able to operate in the State of Michigan. Second of all, they pointed out that it was in relation to the services granted, being able to do that, and then the third component would be the voluntariness, whether they could agree to they didn't have to engage in intrastate trucking  \n You could say the same about a tax. You could say, you know, you only have to pay this tax if you operate in Michigan. You don't want to operate; you don't have to pay it. And you could also say unless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in Michigan. Does that make it a tax or a fee?\n Well, I think in the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion, it it was a fee, and I think I think what we come back to, Your Honor, is the idea is there a specific class of individuals or businesses that are benefitted. And I think that that's the distinction between a fee and tax. Also, a tax is a general revenue-raising measure, whereas a fee is not. And that's another distinction of of a tax. And indeed, this Court in National Cable Industry v. the United States, which we cited in our brief, this Court said as whether an exaction is a tax or a fee depends on whether its purpose is to raise revenue or regulate an industry or services. One of the things  \n I'd like to get back just for a moment  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n to the answer you gave about apportionment because I wasn't quite sure I understood the answer. You said, well, apportionment is very difficult. What are you supposed to do? What are you what's the base? Well, and you said, should we apportion against between in-state and out-of-state, and I would think the answer is yes. That's the whole point.\n Well  \n And if we're talking about mileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently susceptible of apportionment. Now, it may be that administratively this is just too expensive. That may be that may be a very valid argument. But so far as saying that there's no basis for apportionment, I didn't understand your answer.\n Well, I I maybe I misspoke myself. What I really meant to say was it would be very difficult to do. And in our joint appendix in the joint appendix  \n It would be difficult to do administratively. But just because of the cost of collecting all the  \n Well, Your Honor, I think that you got to look at what's the total cost here. The cost is not only to the administrative aspect by the State, but this imposes another cost on the truckers.\n That that I agree that that is expensive. However, it seems to me that it would be easier to do it with trucks which have miles than with  \n But, Your Honor, the problem is  \n than with, say, attorneys or accountants or whatever.\n Your Honor, the problem with that is that this fee, this intrastate fee, does not go to maintain the highways as it was in Scheiner. They make the argument that it's very easy that the mechanism they, being American Trucking, makes the argument that it's very easy to just start logging up the miles and and you have the mechanism there. But the difference between Scheiner and this case is that in Scheiner you were measuring all intrastate miles, any miles traveled within that State. And there's a mechanism available administratively to do that. The IRP requires that. But here you're not logging all intrastate miles. You're only logging those miles in the State that involve a point-to-point delivery, from one intrastate point to another. So you don't you'd have to get a whole new record keeping or you'd have to keep track of a while different set of miles than you would with respect to the IRP. And that's the thing that I find striking about this, that the American Trucking Association is basically saying to its members that they want to have them do more record keeping on their part.\n But the American Trucking Association is is willing to be thrown into the into the briar bush apparently. It certainly involves no no difficulty for your Michigan intrastate truckers. All of their miles are intrastate. And the plaintiffs here say we're we're willing to you know, to provide figures showing how much of our carriage was was exclusively intrastate if you want to apportion.\n Well, that may be, Your Honor, but the the point is what we're dealing with is a a fee that has revenues of about $3 million. And if you have additional record keeping, how much of that $3 million is going to have to be devoted to paying for the administrative costs that are involved?\n May I ask this question? Is the fee payable before the a carrier may engage in business or is it after the carrier has paid? Is it is it like a tax that's paid after the year is out?\n It's paid before. They they have to have  \n If you had to pay it before, there would be no way to calculate it ahead of time because nobody would have had any mileage. Isn't that correct?\n I'm sorry.\n If you have to pay it before the year begins and before you're allowed to engage in the business, you would have no way of measuring the number of miles you're going to travel during the the ensuing year.\n That's correct. You would have to have  \n Well, I suppose that's the same thing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is there. That's paid at the beginning of the year, isn't it? And it has to be apportioned among the States. And you don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of the year.\n Now, you're talking about the interstate fee, Your Honor.\n Right, right. But I'm saying the same problem arises when you do any apportioning.\n Well, it let me back up. The reason I asked with you when you were referring to the $10 fee is because the intrastate fee we have a $10 component in that as well. You can obtain a temporary fee for $10 for 72 hours to conduct an intrastate operation. So the statute in structurally has some apportionment factor in it. So you don't have to necessarily buy the $100 intrastate fee decal to conduct intrastate operations.\n It's like a 3-day fishing license.\n I suppose that would be one way  \n How how does that work in in practice? Is it easily accessible? Suppose the company  \n Well  \n wants to fill up its truck and and it said, well, this is going to be the only haul this season for me, so I want the 3-day permit.\n Yes, Your Honor, you can obtain the permits in advance. You don't have to have trucks lined up at the border waiting to get a decal or get a permit. You can purchase them in advance. So that that's available to the truckers. The one thing I should mention, though, is you have to have one you already have to have one vehicle licensed intrastate. You already have to have paid the fee on one vehicle, and then you would be eligible to purchase additional temporary permits as the need arose based on seasonal needs or an emergency situation. So that that allows the the statute I I would submit to Your Honor, allows some apportioning in and of itself.\n This this applies only to operations that are both licensed and registered in Michigan. Is that so?\n No. Your Honor I think is referring to the interstate fee  \n Right, right, yes.\n which is a different fee, which is in the Mid-Con case. Our position  \n Are you going to address the Mid-Con question?\n I'm sorry?\n Are you going to address the Mid-Con question?\n I was going to do that right now, Your Honor. The position that the State of Michigan and the Michigan Public Service Commission has is the SSRS does not preempt the interstate fee. And the reason for that is  \n Well, what's the point of the limitation in SSRS to $10 if the State can impose any additional fee it wants just by calling it a different name?\n Well, Your Honor, I think what you have to realize is you have when you look at the text of the statute, I think what is very clear from reading the text is that the SSRS does not preempt all State fees and charges on motor carriers. It only preempts those fees and charges that are specifically related to the registration of that motor carrier's interstate authority. The interstate fee, or the Michigan-plated vehicle fee here, is not preempted because it's a regulatory fee that does not relate to the registration of the motor carrier's SSRS interstate authority.\n Of course, it it does. Number one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it applies only to interstate travel.\n Well  \n And and then the the other vehicles pay $100 for the for the in-state fees, and so this seems to me that that on on its face shows that it's like a registration fee.\n Well, Your Honor, I think a couple things. Number one, I think that I believe that if you look at the structure of the Michigan statute, you'll see that under section 2, which contains both the interstate fee and the intrastate fee, virtually all Michigan vehicles that are plated in Michigan the effect of it is that all vehicles that are plated in Michigan will have paid this $100 fee. And furthermore, if you look at section 7 of the Michigan statute, which is 478.7, that involves the registration procedure. That's specifically applicable to the registration of interstate authority. And within that section 7, subsection (4) deals with the payment of the $10 fee for and and it's to be made by vehicles that are not plated in the State of Michigan.\n That's that's the problem.\n Well, that's the argument.\n That's the problem because here we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the fee for them. Well, let me I have a question. I'm trying to test this. Suppose that I have a company in Maine. All right? And I have I decide all my I I have all Maine plates, by the way. And I decide I want my now, let's one word is license plates. I'm going to talk about plating. Another word is the ICC insurance. Let's call it a decal. And the third kind of a concept is whatever you refer to in your statute by a fee. All right? The $100.\n Right.\n All right. Now, suppose in Maine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan to be my home State for purposes of what do you call it? The SS?\n SSRS.\n Yes. And so I go to Michigan, and now I pay all the registration fees here. Do I get a a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to show I did it?\n No. Your Honor, I I you say that you're a Maine company  \n Yes.\n but your principal place of business is in Michigan?\n Yes, yes. So that's right.\n Okay. And your question is?\n Do I get a decal after I go through all this procedure? You have a whole form. I pay $6 for Alabama. I pay $2 for Idaho, and but but I do it all in one shopping place which happens to be Michigan.\n Okay.\n Then do I get a little certificate to put on the truck to say I did it. I I registered my ICC decal everywhere.\n If that vehicle if the vehicle you're registering is plated in Michigan  \n No, it's not.\n Okay. You will pay nothing.\n I know for Michigan. But I have to pay. But Michigan is my I can't ask the question until I get clear on this.\n I'm sorry.\n Don't when I when I go under this this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home State  \n That's correct.\n and I make all the relevant payments to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a piece of paper saying I did it?\n I believe so, Your Honor.\n Fine. Now, I'm now plated in Michigan, and I make Michigan my home State for this. And I go and I make I say, Michigan, I'm going to give you this big check to distribute, but the amount I'm putting here for Michigan, by the way, is zero. And you say pay me $100. No. I'm not going to do it. So I haven't paid them the $100. I haven't paid Michigan everything, but I paid $2 for Idaho. Do I get the decal or don't I?\n To get a decal from Michigan, you have to be Michigan-plated and you have to pay the $100.\n Excellent. Now, if I don't get the decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100 is a charge that falls within the SSI. It is a charge for a decal which shows that I registered the ICC and my insurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me the decal.\n Your Honor, we believe that under the the section 7 of the Michigan law, there is no fee charged for your SSRS.\n I'm talking about a fee. I'm trying to oh, fine. If there's no fee charged and I didn't pay the $100 and I didn't pay anything else, you'd give me the decal. But you said you wouldn't.\n Your Honor, you have to you have to if it's Michigan-plated, that's the triggering mechanism. It's not the that's that's what triggers the $100 fee.\n Mr. Boynton, may I just may I just ask this question? Is part of your position that the Federal statute does not prevent Michigan from waiving the $10 fee on for this particular purpose?\n Our position, with respect to that, Your Honor, is the fact that under section 7 of the Michigan Motor Carrier Act, 478.7, Michigan has no authority to charge a Michigan-plated vehicle any fee at all.\n Right. So that but you're saying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $10 and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are plated in Michigan because they've already charged them $100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being plated.\n Well, I don't know if I'm saying that, Your Honor. I'm saying that the there's a zero charge, and then there's there's another charge with respect to a vehicle fee. The one thing that I need to point out here is that the SSRS is not vehicle-specific. It talks about numbers of vehicles, but the Michigan decal fee for or the interstate fee is vehicle-specific. You have to identify the particular  \n Is that right? Let me let me I wanted to ask this question to see whether it's vehicle-specific. Suppose I have nine trucks. They're Michigan-plated, so I have to pay $100 for each of the nine.\n Interstate commerce.\n Now, suppose I suppose I only pay the fee for eight of them. What happens?\n And how do you want to use the truck? Do you want to use it in interstate commerce?\n No. I've paid for eight, but I haven't paid for the ninth. As I read the Michigan law, it says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or over the highways of this State while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid. Now, if if I can't operate the other eight because I haven't paid for the nine, that sounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.\n Yes, it is.\n I mean I mean the opposite. It's it's not vehicle-specific.\n Oh.\n I've paid for the eight, and I can't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth.\n Well, I think administratively that that wouldn't happen. I I think once you go  \n It seems to me how it reads. Am I reading the law wrong? It says, shall not operate any motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by this act remain unpaid.\n I suppose that if the for for nonpayment of fees, a motor carrier risks its authority to operate in the State.\n At all. So it's not really vehicle-specific.\n Well, I I think it is. I would disagree with Your Honor.\n Well, the computation is vehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles as hostage for the payment of of any shortfall. That's what you're doing, isn't it?\n So it's carrier-based.\n Well, Your Honor, I would have to disagree with Your Honor respectfully. I think that the that it is vehicle-specific because it identifies the particular vehicle that's involved here. And I I think you have to read the statute, the preemption statute, the scope of what preemption has sought to do here, and not all State fees and charges on motor carrier vehicles are preempted.\n Do you place any reliance in this scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it are people who have their principal place of business in Michigan?\n No, Your Honor. The triggering event for the interstate fee is the plating of the vehicle in Michigan.\n And and anyone can choose to do that? I mean, going back to Justice Breyer's example, anybody can say, well, I think I'd like to be plated in Michigan even though I operate in in other States. My principal place of business is in another State.\n Right. I think all parties have noted, Your Honor, that the under the SSRS it's much more stringent, more rigorous  \n No. I'm just asking about what you do in Michigan.\n Yes. Yes, you can.\n You really can do that?\n You can plate wherever you have contacts with the State. If your principal place of business is in Ohio but you have trucks going to and from Michigan, that that would allow you to plate in State of Michigan.\n You you can plate your whole fleet in Michigan under those circumstances.\n You could you can choose where to plate your feet plate your trucks, and a number of considerations go into that. It's not just the license plating fees. It has everything to do as we noted in our brief, it could have to do with no fault insurance, the weight limits on trucks. It's an economic decision and there's a number of different factors that go into that decision of where to plate a vehicle. In conclusion, I would say that the Michigan Court of Appeals correctly decided this case. And they they found that the challenged fees in these cases are regulatory fees, that they serve the critical function of protecting the people of Michigan that use the highways. And the Michigan Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Thank you, Mr. Boynton. Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States as amicus curiae supports the State in American Trucking and the petitioner in Mid-Con. With respect to American Trucking, in our view the central question in resolving the constitutional issue is not whether it would be possible to apportion the intrastate fee on a more precise basis. The question is whether the Constitution requires it. And in the prior cases that we've cited in our brief, both the older cases dealing specifically with intrastate transportation and the more recent cases dealing with authority to engage in other intrastate businesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authority of States and municipalities to charge flat fees for the privilege of engaging in the local business within the jurisdiction during the the relevant period of time. And that practice  \n That seems to me really to go back on on Scheiner. And I thought we tried to get away from deciding Commerce Clause questions on the basis of whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce, you know, the original package doctrine and things that succeeded it. And you're you're just dragging back in this this inquiry into whether it's really interstate or or rather local.\n Well, with with respect, Your Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the notion that there is a bright, absolute line between intrastate activities which are subject to plenary regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune from State regulation. The Court has recognized that the question is more complicated than that. But in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance, the Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an interstate bus trip could be taxed in in its entirety by the State in which the ticket was purchased because the sale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete event properly severable from the underlying interstate transaction. And the case for severance is all the more powerful here. That is, here we're dealing not with a an aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. It's true that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do interstate business, and it's even true that in some instances the intrastate load may be carried on the same truck at the same time that it's also carrying goods between the States. But the intrastate haul is itself a discrete commercial transaction. To the shipper it's wholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the the truck is also doing an interstate business. And to differentiate this case from Scheiner, one of the things that the Court has looked at in the dormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple taxation. And the Court doesn't just mean multiple taxation in in the abstract because it's necessarily going to be the case that an entity that does business in many States will be taxed in many States. Rather the question is whether there's an undue risk of multiple taxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or the same activity. And that was at real risk in Scheiner because if you imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to Florida and passing through several States on the way, and it's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for entering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage traveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable to say that the imposition of those cumulative trips cumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to Florida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same event. Here we don't have a problem with that. The tax is being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. If a particular truck also makes point-to-point hauls in some other State within the calendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they can't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or the same transaction. The second aspect of of Scheiner  \n Yes, it could. I mean, if if this this truck is making one one haul, it's carrying some goods from Texas to to Maine, but some other goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and just carries it to another place within Tennessee, and then it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it elsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed. It seems to me it's it's one trip. We never used to used to divide railroads on the basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the interstate portions and and the two stops within a State can be regulated by the State.\n I mean, I think you're right that it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of goods between States as a discrete, separable event. But if the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and depositing them at another point in Texas, again from the shipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete transaction. The shipper is unlikely to have any interest in whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods among the States. And it's reasonable to regard that as a discrete event that is taxable by the State in which it occurs. The other point to make about Scheiner is that even if we assume, as the petitioner argues, that the average interstate truck that makes some point-to-point hauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the average truck that does business solely within that State, there's still a whole different class of interstate truckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads that could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage traveled and they're being let off the hook because the State has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity. Petitioners' response to this is that you can't discriminate against one class and then make up for it by by discriminating in favor of a different class. And if this were, to use title VII terminology, a disparate treatment case, we would agree. That is, if a State overtly discriminates against one class of interstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of the law those people are treated less favorably, then we would entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for it by giving more favorable treatment to a different class of out-of-state entities. But here the petitioner is making what amounts to a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a disparate impact claim is not that any particular individual has suffered unfair treatment. The way you prove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect cumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in this case in the aggregate. And there's really no way to feel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't do better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to focus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the basis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of-state truckers that are not currently covered. I'd like to speak briefly at least about the the Mid-Con case. And in our view the best way of understanding to to return to the historical antecedents of the current SSRS provision, in its original form, as enacted in 1965, the statute said it's not an unreasonable burden of on interstate commerce to require an interstate carrier to register its Federal certificate so along as you do so in accordance with the standards of the ICC. If you go beyond those standards, it's an unreasonable burden on commerce.\n I'd like to know the text you rely on.\n That was  \n For for preemption, the text of the current statute that you rely on.\n The text of the current statute is set forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari petition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b). And the statute says, the first sentence, the requirement of a State that a motor carrier providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter 1 of chapter 135 and that refers to interstate transportation providing interstate transportation and providing transportation in that State must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred to in section 13501.\n 13501 deals just with SSRS.\n No. 13501 is the provision that that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation and the Surface Transportation Board. And it basically says these agencies have general regulatory jurisdiction over transportation between points in one State and points in another State and or between points in the same State passing through another State. So in in using that shorthand reference, the Congress just means interstate transportation.\n May I ask this question? Because I know your time is short. Supposing Michigan imposed a new $10 fee per and it identified it precisely as in order to comply with that statute and then reduced its present plating fee from $100 to $90, would that be permissible?\n Well, as long as the again, to in our view the distinctive and disqualifying feature of the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed specifically on vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce. And if Michigan reduced to $90 the extra  \n I'm not saying they reduced to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10 fee specifically designed to comply with the statute.\n As long as  \n Could they do that?\n As long as they were still imposing that additional again  \n The $90 is for plating. It said only only Michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90. Everybody else everybody and everybody also pays the $10.\n As long as that $90 fee was imposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally, but specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate entirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's preempted because our reading of the statute is that basically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what you can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to intrastate carriers.\n Where does it say that? Let let me come back to the to the section of the statute you're quoting. You didn't finish the sentence. It says that it's not an unreasonable burden when the State registration is completed under standards of the Secretary under subsection (c). Subsection (c) is entitled SSRS, Single State Registration System.\n May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?\n Briefly.\n The State doesn't argue that this registration was completed in accordance with this standard. It argues that the provision doesn't apply at all because this is not the sort of registration requirement that the statute speaks of. We think it is because it's imposed strictly on interstate carriers.\n Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Digges, you have 4 minutes remaining.\n Thank you. I'd like to just briefly cover three points. First, I believe that that is accurate to say that the Solicitor General's position is returning us to the pre-Complete Auto days of line-drawing, but more than that, the Solicitor General's position is ignoring the practical effect of these fees on taxpayers. I think the the citation to the Peddler v. Drummer line of cases illustrates that. The only difference between the Peddler cases and the Drummer cases was that in the in the Nippert case and and the Drummer case, they looked at the practical effect on an out-of-state salesman and whether that salesman would be discouraged by the $50 fee that was being imposed from coming into the State. In the Wagner case, they simply said that the fee fell on an essentially local event, didn't look at the form of the fee, didn't look at the form of the fee on the out-of-state salesman. I don't think it can be disputed that to out-of-state that out-of-state salesmen would be equally discouraged from coming into a State because a $50 fee or a $100 fee, whether or not they're carrying the goods with them in at that time or whether the goods are later mailed in. So, again, I think it is returning to the line-drawing issues, and really there is no test that is made as to, after you you draw these lines, what the appropriate test should be. The second point is it with respect to the administrative practicality of apportioning these fees. The purpose of apportionment would not be, as in a highway tax, to to show the amount of highway damage that was done by a truck. The purpose of apportionment here is simply to show the extent of the taxpayer's level of activity in the State. It would be like a general revenue tax in which we're trying to allocate the taxpayer's activity to particular States, make sure that that taxpayer is paying its fair share of the State's costs with respect of the State's generic costs, in this case, generic regulatory costs. So, again, I think that apportionment would be very easy. As Justice Scalia said, the trucking industry is willing to take the onus of this. We bill by the mile. You could do it on number of loads. You could do it in a lot a lot of ways. And by apportioning the fee, you eliminate the burden and you make the out-of-state carrier, who would be otherwise prohibited from only hauling a load or two he would then have the ability to haul that load and and not be discriminated against. The final area I'd like to talk about a little bit is the need for additional the need for evidence in this case. Again, in the Nippert and the Scheiner cases, there they they it was expressly said that there was no need for evidence in the cases because in the general average of instances, the out-of-state trucker will always pay more than the in-state trucker. And in answer to your question, Justice Stevens, I think it was recognized in those cases that there would be some exceptions to that rule. There would be a few out-of-state carriers that would operate more heavily in the State than in-state carriers. But that exception wasn't wasn't what was going to happen and the most often, and that the average of instances, it would always work to the disadvantage of the out-of-state carriers. And and the final point is that with respect to evidence, you have here also a failure of internal consistency test, and this Court has said a number of times that failure internal of internal consistency is not a test related it doesn't rely on specific facts but it relies on hypotheticals. And in this instance, I think there's a very clear failure of internal consistency. Like in Scheiner, there's a cumulative burden on an out-of-state trucker. If a trucker wants to operate in intrastate commerce around the country, it has to and just haul one load in every State, it has to pay 48 times a $100 fee or pay $4,800 in eligible in order to be eligible to haul in all of those States. So that illustrates how that's going to balkanize commerce, that that carrier is not going to be able to pay that kind of entrance fee nationwide. So that carrier will operate in less intrastate activities in in only a few States or maybe none. And again, we think that that defeats the purpose. When Congress passed economic deregulation of the trucking industry, that they wanted to open it up to out-of-state carriers to be able to augment their interstate loads.\n Thank you, Mr. Digges.\n Thank you.\n The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Your Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Your Honors, there is no dispute among the parties, nor among the 19 amicus briefs presented before the Court today. As to the answer to the threshold legal question, everyone agrees that the FDA exemption does, indeed, apply, with full force, to the sorts of experiments that are conducted and that would be relevant to the FDA in consideration of an Investigational New Drug application, a so-called IND. So the battleground now shifts to Integra's alternative arguments in support of the judgment  \n Well, would you just clarify something for me as we start to consider the case? I guess this thing went to the jury under an instruction that tried to come to grips with the definition under the statute in some way. Was that instruction one to which Merck preserved an objection?\n No, Your Honor. We did not object to the core of the jury's instructions stating the legal standard. And we  \n Do you think it was properly stated in that instruction?\n The core of the instruction, yes, Your Honor, was  \n That's as good as we could do.\n Your Honor, I believe the answer is, the core was as good as this Court can do, and\n All right. And, under that, you think that Merck was entitled to a directed verdict  \n Yes, Your Honor.\n from the evidence?\n It was entitled to a verdict as a matter of law, but let me just  \n Okay, but the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not address the case in by looking at the evidence and whether a directed verdict should have been given  \n Your Honor, the  \n or not?\n the Federal Circuit did understand that this was a JMOL case  \n I know, but it seemed to decide the case based on its view of the statute as just applying to generic drugs or something like that.\n That is absolutely correct, Your Honor.\n So it didn't, in fact, come to grips with the evidence.\n It absolutely did not come to grips with the evidence, nor did it grapple with the alternative arguments that Integra was presenting  \n Yes, so  \n so they  \n maybe all we have to do is deal with whether that court should have addressed the evidence.\n That would be one answer, Your Honor, reverse and not addressing the alternative legal grounds, but I would urge this Court to address the alternative grounds, because they raise  \n All of them? You mean, like the research tools problem?\n No, Your Honor, because the research tools problem was never presented  \n No.\n as an issue before the jury or before the District Court. And  \n Or the Tripps Treaty?\n No, Your Honor.\n No.\n In fact, that's not even raised by Respondents. It's raised by amici's  \n All right. And how about the common-law research example  \n I would I would urge the Court not broach the subject of any of the questions that are not properly presented  \n Okay, so  \n to this Court.\n all we're doing is looking at the statute.\n We're  \n Thank you.\n Yes, Your Honor, we're looking at the statute  \n Okay.\n but it is an it is important, in answer to the very first question, to embellish a bit, because the lower courts need this Court's guidance, because every one of the theories on which Integra defends the judgment below raise exactly the same problems that the Federal Circuit's opinion raises. They defy the plain language of the statute Congress passed. They are equally at odds with the purpose that Congress had in mind when it passed the FDA exemption.\n What are the alternative grounds that you're discussing now passed on by the Federal Circuit?\n Your Honor, they were not passed on by the Federal Circuit, except perhaps to the extent that the Federal Circuit may have concluded that all or that, excuse me that safety is the only issue before the FDA when it is considering an Investigational New Drug application, or that a drug innovator may not harbor additional purposes in an experiment beyond the FDA exemption, or that the excuse me beyond FDA regulatory purposes or, third, that the exemption does not cover efforts to optimize the drug candidate after it's identified and that drug candidate is, in fact, the lead candidate. Those are the three legal theories, Your Honors, on which Integra is resting its defense of the judgment below. And every single one of them is either incorrect as a matter of law or immaterial as a matter of law. If this Court were to ask Integra to come up with a single genuine issue of fact that does not relate to one or another of those three propositions, it will not be able to do so, save a footnote to be addressed later about the credibility of witnesses on a topic on which Integra never argued the witnesses were not credible. Just beginning with the safety question, and I'll defer to the Government on that, because the Government can speak better than anyone else as to what it is that is relevant to the FDA in consideration of an IND, suffice it to say that the regulations say, as a matter of law, that safety is not the only consideration before the FDA as it considers an IND. The FDA cares very much about whether a drug will work: efficacy. The FDA cares very much about how it works: mechanism of action. It cares about what the body does to that drug: pharmacokinetics. And it cares very much about what that drug does to the body: pharmacology. And Integra's position before the jury, and before this Court, depends upon the proposition that it can bring in a witness to argue that the law is other than what the law clearly is. And the same thing goes for the so-called GLP studies that the FDA considers in connection with safety data, but need not limit itself to GLP studies when it's considering those other IND-relevant topics.\n Mr. Rosenkranz, just one piece of information. Because the IND is so important at this point, is it in the record do we have a copy of the IND?\n The IND, Your Honor, is not in the record, because it was excluded from evidence, which may be why the jury reached the wrong conclusion. But, I hasten to add, that will not be uncommon in these sorts of cases, because there are many circumstances in which a preclinical study begins and fails, and the IND will never materialize. There are circumstances in which a preliminary injunction is brought and won, and the research stops cold, so an IND never materializes. And, again, it's important to understand, as one assesses the FDA exemption, that the inquiry is always ex ante, it is always, \"What is a reasonable drug innovator? What does that drug innovator or scientist know at the point in time at which it is about to perform the next set of experiments?\" So you always reflect back to a point in time before the IND materializes.\n Mr. Rosenkranz, the items you listed earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what I took to be the point of your opening brief, which was that the decision below was wrong because the Federal Circuit simply excluded all consideration of materials prepared for purposes of the IND, as opposed to materials prepared for the for the drug application, later on. Are you abandoning that more expansive position?\n No, Your Honor.\n Because I don't read the opinion that way. I don't think that opinion has to be read to say that they're not going to allow in anything that goes to the IND.\n Your Honor, there is certainly a way to read the Federal Circuit's opinion and this is also in response to Justice O'Connor's earlier question in which it did grapple with the very questions we're talking about now, and did answer the questions about whether it's just safety and I believe the Federal Circuit believed that only safety data were relevant; that is certainly what it indicated in oral argument and also that dual purposes are not permissible. So let me now turn to the dual-purpose question, because it's another major theme of  \n Have you answered my question? You're abandoning the assertion that the Federal Circuit did not consider anything that didn't go to the IND that didn't go to the  \n The  \n drug application.\n No, Your Honor. I believe that there are two ways to read the Federal Circuit's opinion. To the extent that the Federal Circuit said nothing before the clinical stage is relevant to the FDA exemption if that is what the Federal Circuit held, we are we are not abandoning the position that that is wrong. I understand that there is another way to read the Federal Circuit's opinion that grapples with the subsidiary questions that we're discussing here, which are all fairly presented in our question presented. And that's what I'm addressing myself to now.\n For your first answer, are you relying what the Federal Circuit said in its opinion and it's in 10a of our cert petition appendix that is, the Federal Circuit's statement of the question presented, whether the preclinical research conducted under Scripps-Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of Integra's patents.\n Yes, Your Honor. And then, two pages later, on 12a, the Federal Circuit states its conclusion, and I quote, \"Thus, the Scripps work sponsored by Merck was not solely for use as reasonably related to clinical testing for the FDA.\"\n Yes, but it it's not at all clear in the opinion that the Court was using preclinical and clinical in the very technical sense that you were that you use it, which means \"clinical\" is stuff submitted for the drug application, and \"preclinical\" is for the earlier application. That is not at all  \n Your Honor, it's not at all clear. And, just as in Boyle, when this Court faced a situation where it wasn't clear what the Federal or, excuse me what the Court of Appeals held, the Court  , \"The best thing for this Court to do is to address what appears to be the threshold question that the Court of Appeals decided,\" but then also to address the subsidiary questions on the basis of which Integra is defending the judgment below.\n Well, Mr. Rosenkranz  \n A moment ago a moment ago, you were reading from 12(a). Was it the first sentence you were reading from?\n It was the first paragraph, and I was reading from the end of that paragraph, Your Honor, the which begins, \"Thus,\" three lines really two the word \"thus\" is at the end of the third line from the bottom of that paragraph, Your Honor.\n Thank you.\n And so, I was saying earlier that a critical component of Integra's case revolves around the notion that the use may not have more than one purpose, and that purpose can only be FDA directed. That argument is also incorrect as a matter of law. And one way we can tell that is that there is no such thing as a preclinical course of study that has only one purpose. When one is studying mechanism of action, a scientist is deeply interested, not just in how this drug works, but in how the disease works. And the language of the statute is, of course, the touchstone here. The statute is triggered by uses. The use, in this context, is an experiment. And the statute covers, provides a safe harbor for, experiments that develop the sorts of information that are relevant to the FDA. If that  \n Would that would that would that be explained by the research-tool doctrine, or not?\n No, absolutely not, Your Honor. The research-tool question let me begin by saying, these were not research tools; these RGD peptides were the objects of study.\n I guess what I was asking, Would you ever use the peptide as a research tool, was my was my question.\n Oh, yes, Your Honor. There are circumstances in which these peptides could be used as research tools to stunt the growth of blood vessels and study what happens next with other compounds, but they were emphatically not used as research tools in this case. In this case, they were the objects of study, and Integra won a jury verdict based upon that presentation. And, in fact, never argued to any court or to the jury that there is a resource tool carve out. So, I was just talking about the subjective purpose earlier, and it is again, it's important to note that the information can be used for other purposes. There's nothing in the statute that prohibits that. Now, let me turn, just briefly then, to what is often one of the most important questions in these FDA exemption cases, which is the timeline question. At what point in the arc of drug development is it unreasonable for a jury to conclude that the FDA is an inappropriate audience for the next set of experiments? Our position and people may differ, as a matter of law, as to whether it is earlier but our argument is, at a bare minimum, at the point in time at which a drug developer has a known structure and cures a disease in an animal with that known structure, all eyes turn to drug development; which is to say, all eyes turn to the FDA. As a matter of law, everything after that, so long as it's relevant to the FDA, is FDA is appropriate to view as FDA directed.\n Do you agree then that at whatever period, however you want to describe the period, at which the researcher is basically trying to figure out what drug to concentrate on, that that period is too far back in time to come within the exception?\n No, Your Honor. That's exactly the trigger moment. If it has a structure, and it's investigating analogs of that structure to figure out which of these various structures are the best ones to move forward, everything from that point on is FDA directed.\n Okay, here's what here's the problem I have with your argument. I can understand that argument more easily under the statute, under the text of the statute as it is written, than I can understand it under the instruction that you agreed to, because the instruction that you agreed to had a limitation, a textual limitation which is not in the statute itself, that refers to \"relatively directly\" as describing the relationship between this information and its object. And if we decide this case on the basis of the statute, and we read the statute more broadly than the instruction, then you're getting something that you're not entitled to, because you agreed to the instruction. If we decide this issue by construing the statute as if your instruction is correct, then we're making an assumption about the proper construction of the statute that has not been argued here.\n Well, Your Honor  \n It seems to me that the law of the case, as to what the statute means for your case, is set by the instruction, and that is why I am reluctant to get into the issue that you raise here, because I think we're rather you are limited, and we are tied in what we can do as a result of your agreement with the instruction.\n Your Honor and I see my time is running out; I'd like to reserve a bit for rebuttal, so let me answer, just briefly. Under Praprotnik, of course, this Court is not bound by law of the case by the instruction. But the instruction, as I understand it, says exactly what the statute says. \"Reasonably directly\" is simply another way of saying, \"Are these activities reasonably related to the FDA purposes?\" And every one of the comparative experiments is relevant to the FDA's inquiry, whether this drug or that is the optimum drug. Every experiment that is involved here and there were only 10 percent that were comparative in nature develops information about the lead drug candidate, including understanding why this one works, rather than that one. So, if it's all right, Your Honors, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\n Very well, Mr. Rosenkranz. Mr. Joseffer.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I believe the question before the Court is the proper construction of the statute, and we believe the lower courts committed three important legal errors that should be corrected. The first is in drawing the clinical/preclinical distinction. And, understanding that, Justice Scalia, I think the important thing to understand is that clinical studies refer to studies conducted on humans, and at the IND stage, the whole question is to decide whether studies should be conducted on humans. So at that point in time the only information that's available is the preclinical studies on animals and in test tubes. So when the Court distinguished between preclinical and clinical, it was essentially saying, you cannot do the information that's necessary to submit an IND, necessary to do clinical trials, necessary to get your drug approved. And that's why we it seems to us that that's clearly wrong.\n Do you have to have the FDA's permission to start clinical testing?\n Yes, that's the purpose of an IND application, is the whole the only thing that FDA is looking at, at that point, is whether to permit human clinical trials to proceed. The second important legal error committed by the Federal Circuit was in apparently concluding that only tests regarding the compounds ultimately submitted to FDA in an IND are subject to the protection. Now, the problem with that is that a company can decide which specific compound to submit only by first comparing doing studies on that compound and on others in order to determine which would be the best compound to submit, which would strike the best balance between obtaining health effects or avoiding safety concerns. So, if the exemption only  \n Would you state again what you say the second error was?\n The second error, we believe, is that the Federal Circuit indicated that only studies undertaken on the single compound ultimately submitted in an IND are protected by the exception. And the problem with that is that I can't figure out what that one compound is until I've done studies on it and on other compounds to determine  \n That  \n which is the best to submit.\n But that might well determine whether the research was relatively directly related. I mean, if I were a juror, I would I would say it's relatively directly related if it relates to that particular compound which is ultimately submitted, and not relatively directly related if it was preliminary, trying to found out which compound to submit.\n We would we would look at it this way. If I'm say I have 12 compounds that I'm going to test and decide which is best and go forward with. At the time I'm doing a test on any one of those compounds, if those tests succeed, it's reasonably foreseeable I'll submit an IND for that compound.\n Yes, I understand all that. But  \n And the  \n I'm just saying that that is certainly one interpretation of \"reasonably directly.\" And if that is so, then you are erroneous in your assumption that the question before this Court is the meaning of the statute. It might not be. It might be it might be the meaning of the instruction.\n Well, I think we would disagree with that, for two reasons. The first is that the Federal Circuit, as Justice O'Connor noted, reserved resolved these questions entirely as a matter of law, based on a de novo interpretation of the statute, without regard to the jury instruction. And that's the holding that's now before this Court.\n What's your position on the jury instruction? Does it correctly state the law?\n We think that it's if it's construed correctly, we think that it's correct, but just too general to be of assistance to the courts in addressing the more specific questions of the issue here. And this is remember, Merck has sought judgment as a matter of law. And when a party seeks judgment as a matter of law, the courts are not constrained to only applying the law that's found in the jury instruction; they can also articulate and apply and do all the time other legal principles that are relevant. Praprotnik v. St. Louis is a great example of a case where this Court did that. Now, there would be a problem if the jury instruction was inconsistent with the correct rule of law, because then there could be a waiver concern. But we don't see that at issue here, because the jury instruction, we think, was just too general to speak to these issues. But getting back to my point about why it can't be limited to that single compound  \n But who's fault is that that the jury instruction is too general. I mean, if both parties agreed to it, aren't they, in a sense, bound by it?\n We think that the Petitioner should not, and is not, arguing inconsistently with the jury instruction. The point is just that juries, being lay people, tend to be instructed  \n The Petitioner said he agreed with the core of the instruction, whatever that is.\n I think that's just with the general principles. Take, for example, a negligence case. Jurors are instructed all the time that the Defendant has a duty of ordinary care. And then courts, on appeal, will determine more specific legal questions, whether entire classes of conduct do or do not comply with the ordinary care, in much greater detailed instructions to the jury. And example of a case where this Court did that would be Shenker v. B&O Railroad, at 374 U.S. 1. And we think that in a in determining whether a Petitioner is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, this Court should just articulate and apply the specific legal principles here; they're not inconsistent with the jury  \n Was the court below wrong in saying that the statute was enacted only to help generic-drug development?\n Yes. In fact, this Court already held in Eli Lilly v. Medtronic that the statute is not limited to generic drugs. In fact, it's not even limited to drugs, but also applies to things like medical devices, food additives, color additives. And it's a very important point, because the Federal Circuit thought the statute to be construed in an artificially narrow manner in light of a supposed focus on generic drugs, which is just inconsistent with this Court's authoritative construction of the statute.\n Is that going to be your third point, the third error that the court supposedly committed?\n No, the third is the error committed by the District Court and relied on by Respondents here, which is the statement that FDA only considers safety, and not efficacy, in determining whether to permit human clinical trials to proceed. It's a very important point, because at the IND stage the question for FDA is whether a drug should be given to human beings. And because there's no such thing as an absolutely safe drug, because all drugs entail at least some safety risks, FDA will not let human clinical trials proceed unless there's some reason to believe that the study could be useful. It's a it's a benefit-risk analysis. The Court looks to whether the potential benefits of the test would outweigh the risks of the test; and if not, the Court will not let a test proceed. Now, Congress charged FDA with doing that by instructing FDA to determine whether the drug would pose an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of humans. And FDA has construed that, as I said, to mean the benefit-risk. The most express articulation of that comes in the guidance document that FDA has put out regarding the preparation of the investigators brochure, which is a required part of the 9d submission. And the investigators and the guidance document explains that the investigators brochure must provide sufficient information for the for the reader to, quote, \"make his/her own unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the proposed clinical.\" That's set forth on the bottom of page 10 of our brief. And  \n What are the consequences if someone goes ahead and conducts a clinical trial without the approval of the FDA?\n That's contrary to federal law. I certainly would be severe civil consequences. And my guess is there are criminal consequences for doing that, too.\n Your time is short, so could you tell us how far back you think, under the statute, you can go and not and be within the safe harbor?\n Yes. We think that the proper test looks to whether a company is trying to develop a particular drug, by which we mean a substance with particular characteristics designed to achieve particular objectives. To explain that, we recognize that basic scientific research into human biology and disease processes is not protected. That's just too far down the stream of causation. But once I get a particular concept for a drug, this says I'm going to treat the disease in a particular way by targeting a particular part of the disease process. Then we think that the work done, going forward, with includes comparing different substances to figure out which would be the best active ingredient, is protected. To provide a concrete example  \n Why isn't that basic research? I mean, I want to I want to treat this disease by stifling the development of blood cells around it, or something like that, and then you ask yourself, \"Gee, what would stifle the production of blood cells?\" And let's assume there hasn't been any research done in that field before. You wouldn't consider that basic research, so long as the idea I have in my in my head is, I want to create a drug to treat this disease that will stifle blood cells?\n No. And here's why. The basic insight, and then I'll explain it, is that the first time a study a study is run on a particular substance, if that's first study is not protected, then the exemption is worthless, because I'd have to commit that infringing study before I gained the protection of the exemption. So, we would say that the in this case, for example I think it's easier on particulars the basic research was figuring out that the key to cancer is the key to the growth of tumors is angiogenesis, and the key to blocking angiogenesis is blocking the alpha v beta 3 receptors. That's the basic research into how the body works. But once I then start trying to figure out which substance would best block an alpha v beta 3 receptor, it's very specific, because I know what that receptor is, I know what it's like, I know what characteristics I'm going to need in a drug to block that. And when I try different things out to block that, that first experiment, at that point, has to be protected, because, otherwise, I'd have to commit the infringement before I could get  \n Did the earlier process that you described, the basic research, is that within the common law research exemption?\n The it would be if it was noncommercial.\n How does the common law research exemption figure into this case, if at all?\n It's not directly before here because Petitioner has not relied on it at all, and for good reason, which is that the courts have consistently held that the common law research exception applies only to noncommercial activity. The most obvious example would be kids in their basements. But when a drug company, that its entire business is developing and manufacturing drugs, undertakes the activity, that's commercial, and that's never been considered protected by the common law exception.\n Does Scripps is Scripps in the business, too?\n I see my red light is on, if I could answer the question. Some of Scripps' work, when it's working directly for Merck, certainly is, we would think, you know, tied closely to Merck's commercial activities. Scripps may also do some other bioresearch  \n Thank you, Mr. Joseffer. Mr. Flores.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court stated, in Black versus Cutter Laboratories, which is cited on page 27 of our brief, as follows, \"At times, the atmosphere in which an opinion is written may become so surcharged that unnecessarily broad statements are made. In such a case, it is our duty to look beyond the broad sweep of the language and determine for ourselves precisely the ground on which the judgment rests.\" This is such a case. The judgment of the Federal Circuit was its order affirming the District Court's denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law. The precise grounds for the Federal Circuit's opinion is set forth in page 14a in the appendix attached to Merck's petition for certiorari. And there the Federal Circuit said that it upheld the denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law because the Federal Circuit discerned no error in the District Court's interpretation of section 271(e)(1), which raises the question  \n Where is this? Page 14a  \n Yes, Your  \n What are you quoting from?\n Is it just before the letter \"b\" on 14a?\n Yes, Your Honor.\n What are the first few words of the sentence there that you quoted?\n \"Because the language and context of the safe harbor do not embrace the Scripps-Merck general biomedical experimentation, this Court discerns no error\"  \n Exactly. And so, they are saying that they're wrong on their ground for thinking that the language and context don't embrace it. Since they used the wrong standard, they never got to the question of whether the evidence warranted a directed verdict. So I don't see how we avoid looking at all of what you'd call the atmospherics.\n The precise holding and the reasoning of the Federal Circuit was, they found no error in what the District Court's  \n Because they interpreted the statute in a particular way. Isn't that right? I'm asking. I'm not  \n No, Your Honor.\n No?\n The only interpretation of the statute that can be found in the District Court's order denying Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law is the standard articulated in the jury instruction.\n No, but I think I think the Justice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals that  \n Yes.\n applied a particular standard. And certainly it had to have been. Didn't the Court of Appeals have a particular standard as to what constituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed to the kind of experimentation that's covered by the by the safe harbor exemption? It must have had. I mean, how could you how could you rule on the question before you unless you have, in your head, a notion of what the safe harbor consists of and what is beyond it?\n The question before the Federal Circuit was whether the District Court erred by not applying the rational predicate interpretation of section 271(e), which was the sole focus of Merck's appeal to the Federal Circuit.\n Why should we say that's the question, when the Federal Circuit, itself, said what I read before from 10a?\n Your Honor, on page 10a, the Federal Circuit said, \"Thus\" and this is in the the last sentence in the middle paragraph of the page \"Thus, this Court must determine whether section the section 271(e) safe harbor reaches back down the chain of experimentation to embrace development and identification of new drugs that will, in turn, be subject to FDA approval.\"\n That would answer that question?\n It does not. The Federal Circuit answered that in the negative. The Federal Circuit rejected the interpretation advanced by Merck, which was the rational predicate standard, which was basically a causal test, and held that the District Court's interpretation, under the Intermedics standard that's given in the jury instruction, that Merck now concedes is the correct standard.\n So they say that it does not the safe harbor does not reach, among other things, back down the chain of experimentation to embrace the development of new drugs that will be subject to FDA approval. In your opinion, is that statement, as I read it I left out the word \"identification\" as I read it, is that statement a correct statement of the law, or incorrect statement?\n That is a correct statement of the law.\n That is a correct statement of the law. So then, I take it, the other thinks that it isn't, because, for example, you could have a situation where you are developing drugs, and, in developing drugs, you do some experiments and you get some information that would be useful to the FDA and the IND process, and, therefore, they are within the safe harbor.\n No, Your Honor. I believe the Solicitor General agrees with this aspect of the Federal Circuit's opinion and makes that clear at the bottom of page 15 and onto page 16 of the Solicitor General's brief. Merck no longer challenges this aspect of the Federal Circuit's opinion. Merck concedes that there are experiments in the basic research phase, that, although they're necessary in the chain of causation, are not exempt. The rational Merck has abandoned the rational predicate standard that the Federal Circuit rejected here.\n Mr. Flores, when I asked you about the sentence on page 10, I intended, not the one that you read, but an earlier one that precedes it, and that is, \"The questioning arising in this case is whether the preclinical research\" that is, the research on animals, as distinguished from humans \"conducted under the Scripps-Merck agreement is exempt from liability for infringement of Integra's patents.\" Now, if you just took that as the question, then you would say it this Circuit is drawing the line between clinical and preclinical. It's not a crystal-clear opinion, by any means, but that is one question presented that they've identified. And how do they answer that question?\n Your Honor, I disagree. I think the operative language in this sentence is the reference to \"the Scripps-Merck\" is to \"research conducted under the Scripps-Merck agreement.\"\n That's the way I read it. It the and this is why I was disagreeing with counsel from the other side. It well, counsel ultimately conceded, you could read it not to draw the line between clinical and preclinical. And the way you read this sentence is the question, they say, is not whether preclinical research falls under 271(e)(1); it's whether the \"preclinical research conducted under the Scripps- Merck agreement.\" And then the next sentence explains what that means. The experiments did not supply information for submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration, but, instead, identified the best drug candidate. So, I think what they're describing as the question presented is whether preclinical research that is that is not directed to supplying information for submission to the Food and Drug Administration, but, instead, to selecting the drug candidate, whether that type of preclinical research is within the safe harbor.\n Yes. In fact, Justice Scalia, if this opinion by the Federal Circuit were interpreted to hold that preclinical experiments are categorically excluded from the scope of the exemption, that holding would be inconsistent with the District Court's interpretation of the law, because the District Court's interpretation of the law was that preclinical experiments are potentially eligible, and the District Court submitted the question to the jury. So the Federal Circuit would be completely inconsistent, if, on the one hand, it categorically excluded preclinical experiments, and, on the other hand, it approved the District Court's reasoning.\n This very dialogue makes me able to ask a question that I think will reveal better to you what I need an answer to. Reading this, and listening to the discussion, and your use of the word \"atmospherics,\" suggests that the opinion below is pretty foggy. We have Merck, the Food and Drug Administration, the Government, the entire biotechnology industry, the drug industry of the United States, and everybody else telling us that they are wrong in the way they stated the standard. And you, yourself, urge us to look beyond the way they stated it. So, what's the harm, and why wouldn't we, given this and the unclarity, just try to do a better job at stating the standard, say, \"That's the standard,\" and then send it back, and then you can make all your arguments there about how it applies.\n Yes. The reason it would not be appropriate for the Court to do so is because no standard, other than the Intermedics standard that was applied by the District Court, was ever suggested to the District Court. There was only one standard ever considered.\n We're not reviewing the District Court's opinion. We granted certiorari as to the particular question which will deal with what was the Court of Appeals opinion. We don't ordinarily simply compare the Court of Appeals' opinion with the District Court's opinion to see if they parse.\n Yes, Your Honor. But in this case the issue before the District Court was whether the District Court erred in denying a motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n Well, don't you think that the Federal Circuit may have focused too much on generic drug applications? Do you think it was right about that?\n I think the Federal Circuit was right, as a factual matter, in describing the impetus for Congress adopting section 271(e).\n Well, it seemed to be driven by its very narrow focus on generic drug development. Do you do you think that the efficacy of the drug being suggested plays a role in the IND application?\n No, Your Honor, it does not.\n See, I think there may be a difference there, because I think the other side thinks that how the drug is expected to work, in practice, and whether it, in fact, will attack a certain disease, is part of what the FDA looks at. Apparently, the Government takes that position, as narrowly as I could determine. But you reject that, as well.\n Yes, Your Honor. I think the answer to that is in the statute. It's a it's section it's 21 United States Code 355(i)(3)(B)(i). And in that  \n Can you repeat that 355 what?\n (i)  \n (i)  \n (3)   (B)(i) again. And, in this section, Congress is telling the FDA what are the considerations that the FDA has to weigh in making the safety decision, the decision whether to allow clinical trials in humans  \n Is this text that you're referring to, is it someplace is the text someplace where we can look at it while you're explaining this to us?\n No, Your Honor, it's not in the appendix, unfortunately. Let me read that statute, because it's instructive about what Congress told FDA to weigh for the  \n But does the does the statute is that the only place we would look to decide whether safety is the only consideration for the FDA?\n No, Your Honor. The regulations, I believe, address that. And the regulations are 312.22(a), which is in the appendix attached to Integra's brief on the merits. And I'll read that. It says  \n But you do  \n What are you  \n you do agree, do you not, that the Government does not agree with you on this point?\n The Government disagrees, Your Honor.\n Right.\n What are you reading from?\n Page 3a in the addendum to Integra's brief.\n Okay.\n That's 21 C.F.R. Section 312.22(a). It states that, \"The FDA's primary objectives in reviewing an IND are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure the safety and rights of subjects, and, in phase two and three, to help assure that the quality of the scientific investigation of the drugs is adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug's effectiveness and safety.\"\n Okay, that talks about the primary concern. There is certainly going to be concern with efficacy to this extent. They are going to want to know, before they allow clinical trials, whether the drug that it is proposed to give cancer patients has some relationship to cancer, as opposed to the common cold. Admittedly, at the clinical trial they're trying to find out how effective it is on human beings, but there's got to be some threshold showing of effectiveness. They can't simply ignore effectiveness and look at safety entirely prior to that point.\n In fact, that paragraph refers to effectiveness, as I read it.\n Yes, it does, Your Honor. But it does it refers to it in the context of phases two and three. And the simple fact is that until there's clinical trials in humans, there's no way tell whether this drug is going to be effective.\n But there is at least there's got to be some way to tell whether it even addresses the disease. That is essentially a threshold effectiveness question.\n The FDA statutes and regulations do not use the term \"efficacy\" to describe that. In section 355(i)(3)(B)(i), when Congress listed the factors to consider, what it listed was not efficacy. Efficacy is not to be found where its listed  \n Congress described the need that there be some relationship between the consequences of taking the given drug and the disease which is supposed to be addressed by taking the drug. If they didn't use the word \"efficacy,\" what word did they use?\n They  \n They used the word \"effectiveness,\" which is pretty close. [Laughter.]\n No, Your Honor, they used the word, in the statute, \"the condition for which the drug is to be investigated.\"\n That's important. They say they want to know the pharmacological action of the drug in relation to its proposed therapeutic indication. The reason, I take it, the word \"efficacy\" is not there directly is because that word has a history, the Kefauver hearings, and it was involving drugs that don't do anything. Safety is a different matter. But of course when you consider whether something is safe, you must know, since, for example, cancer drugs poison people, the extent to which that poisoning is outbalanced by its effect in curing people. So how could you possibly, particularly where cancer is at issue, know whether this is an appropriately safe drug, without knowing how effective it is, as well as knowing the side effects that are that are harmful? If I knew that there was any answer to that question at all, I might be tempted to agree with you, because it doesn't use the word. But what's the answer?\n The answer is that the FDA considers what information is available to it. It does not have information about the effectiveness of the drug, because clinical trials have not taken place; and, therefore, the regulations and the statutes say you do the what you can. You look at the condition for which the drug  \n But why wouldn't it have information about effectiveness on animals? I mean, if the you show that the all the FDA's interested in is that it didn't kill the animal, never mind whether it was effective to cure the tumor?\n The FDA is concerned with safety in animals. And there may be some cases in which there is a known safety risk to a drug, and there will be a heightened look at potential benefits in order to balance that out. But the regulations focus on safety. And in this particular case  \n Yes, but it's absolutely clear, I thought, that the FDA, at the end of the day in some of these drug applications, ends up looking at not only safety, but how effective it is. And sometimes if the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great, I understood at least, that could affect the decisions. So, I would think that you would want to encourage the exemption to cover those matters.\n Your Honor, of course FDA is very concerned about efficacy, and it but concerned about that after it gets data from human clinical trials. That's the that is the basis of  \n Well, I'm not sure. If there's data earlier, at the IND stage, as a result of the lab tests and the animal tests, I would think that would be part of the exemption.\n If efficacy or some information about what benefits the drug might have, is probably a better way to phrase it is considered at the safety stage as part of the safety balancing, then it's got to be done under good laboratory practices, because  \n Suppose that we concluded well, I don't want to cut you off. Go ahead, please. If I cut you off.\n Yes. If I believe the Solicitor General's point is that the safety decision is a practical one, and you've got to look at both sides of the ledger potential harm, potential benefit I don't believe it's proper to call that \"efficacy.\" But whatever you call it, if it's part of the safety balancing it has to be done under good laboratory procedures. That, I think, is clear from the FDA regulations. And, as a matter of policy, it wouldn't make any sense for the FDA to say that half of the safety equation need not be done under good laboratory practices. Both parts of the safety equation have to be done under that.\n I don't so what? I don't understand what conclusion that leads to.\n Well, Justice Scalia, let me say that I think that this whole discussion about the interpretation of the FDA law is really somewhat off the point here.\n I was beginning to think that, too. [Laughter.]\n And the reason I say that is because we're not here to judge the legality of an FDA action in its discretion, saying we want to consider preclinical  \n Yes, but the reason you brought it up is because the particular certificate that is for a safety-certified lab is not applicable to the lab that used this stuff. That's why you brought it up, I think.\n That is correct.\n And I understand that. And you'd have to conclude, for them to win but suppose I did conclude suppose, for hypothetical the sake of for as a hypothetical, suppose I thought, yes, this does include the safety part, looking at how effective drugs are, too. Suppose I concluded that the statute meant sometimes you could do that, in an ordinary laboratory that didn't have the special certificate? Suppose I concluded that, indeed, you could look well in advance of the clinical test period to get the information for the IND? And suppose I concluded that sometimes, where it was reasonably related, you could, in fact, look at other drugs, too, that are related to the ones you do. If I concluded that and I'm not saying I would then would you concede that a directed verdict would have been appropriate against you?\n No, Your Honor.\n Because? And what's your strongest argument that it wouldn't?\n Well, Your Honor, there's numerous admissions in the record that Merck made which would indicate that they've that the program carried out at Scripps was not reasonably related to the FDA, that the real FDA work was being done in Germany, that the majority of these experiments conducted by Scripps were conducted on chicken embryos, which Merck's own scientists agree have nothing to do with safety, and, by logical extension, they can't tell you much about efficacy, either. Merck agreed that a significant portion of these experiments in which Merck was looking for non-peptide compounds as possible drug candidates, is something that  \n Well, we don't I hope we don't have to, at this Court, look at all the evidence and try to sort it out that way. What we have to focus on is whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was in error in articulating the scope of the exemption.\n Your Honor, this Court does not have to get into Rule 50 review of the evidence here  \n No.\n because there's no dispute about the legal standard. We've all heard that this morning. The only other possible issue is Rule 50 review. But Merck has failed  \n Well, I thought the issue was whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit correctly determined the scope of the exemption. If they were wrong about it, then it is open to us to correct that and send it back.\n Your Honor, the Federal Circuit didn't determine the scope of the invention. There's it's  \n Exemption. The statutory exemption. I thought that was what we were looking at.\n Yes, that's what I was referring to. The Federal Circuit didn't articulate a standard for that. The Federal Circuit approved the District Court's use of the Intermedics standard, under which preclinical experiments are potentially  \n Well, but it certainly thought that the FDA considers only safety, and nothing else, that it was directed at generic drugs, not others, and that there was a cutoff point earlier than that argued by the Government and the Petitioner for what is exempt preclinical trial information.\n The Federal Circuit's opinion, I believe the Federal Circuit's opinion rejects the rational predicate theory. It does not articulate an alternative standard to that. It merely  \n They spent about ten pages in the appendix trying to do that.\n But Federal Circuit didn't do that. That was discussion in there. It gave a lot of background about the statute, which may not have been necessary for its ultimate holding. But the Federal Circuit, when it comes down to it, didn't do anything other than approve the District Court's interpretation. Now, if the Federal Circuit did something different than that, which we just which is Integra does not believe is the case, its judgment should be upheld on the grounds articulated, that it could discern no error in the District Court's judgment in the District Court's denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law. To respond to one of Justice O'Connor's earlier questions, \"Does this Court have to get into a Rule 50 review,\" the answer is no, because Merck failed to preserve its right to Rule 50 review. In the District Court, in the Federal Circuit, the Merck argued the rational predicate standard as a matter of law. That was rejected. Rule 50 review, under the Intermedics standard, is an entirely different argument, and Merck never raised that argument in before the Federal Circuit. In its brief, Merck relies, on pages 50 and 51 of its brief to the Federal Circuit, saying there it argued substantial evidence. But what it argued there was, the experiments are rational predicates. Merck never argued, before the Federal Circuit, that the verdict can't be sustained under Rule 50, under the Intermedics standard, as opposed to the rational predicate standard, so it's not entitled to that review here.\n The dissenting judge did not the dissenting judge, Judge Newman, did not read the Court's opinion the way you do. Is that correct?\n That is correct, Your Honor.\n Maybe we should take that into account, to some extent, that someone who participated on the bench had a different take on what her colleagues were saying?\n That is certainly a consideration, but we disagree with Judge Newman on that point.\n Is there a difference between you and Merck concerning the scope and extent of the common law research exemption? And if there is, does that even enter into our case?\n That issue hasn't entered into the case, so there's been no differences articulated, Your Honor. And to get back to the point that Merck did not preserve its right to Rule 50 review under the Intermedics standard, even if it had raised that issue before the Federal Circuit, clearly the Federal Circuit didn't reach that issue. And if the Federal Circuit didn't reach an issue that was properly presented before it, that was error, and Merck would have had to seek relief from that error. And it did not do so in its petition for certiorari. So, I do not believe this Court even needs to address the issue of Rule 50 review. There is no dispute in this case as to the substantive standard that governs the scope of Section 271(e)(1), and Merck, having failed to preserve its rights to Rule 50 review under the Intermedics standard, there his no controversy for this Court to decide. If the Court does reach the issue of Rule 50 review under Intermedics, it is the case should be decided under the basic principles that it is the exclusive province of the jury to weigh the evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses. And my time is up, but almost but I'll say one thing. After 25 days of trial, the District Judge, in his denial of Merck's motion for judgment as a matter of law, expressly said that the jury had reasonable cause to disregard the testimony of Merck's main witness, Dr. Cheresh. And, on that ground alone, the judgment of the Federal Circuit should be sustained. Merck can't be rescued from the jury's verdict unless this Court determines, as a matter of law, that the jury was required to believe the testimony of Dr. Cheresh. And Merck can't show that, and hasn't even attempted to show that. Unless there are any questions  \n Thank you, Mr. Flores. Mr. Rosenkranz, you have two minutes remaining.\n Thank you, Your Honor. With my two minutes, I want to make one overarching important point, and it's really in response to a question Justice Scalia asked. The emphasis in the statute is about the use, so let's get past labels about, Is this drug discovery or basic research, or is it, as Merck says, optimization on the lead drug candidate, and look at exactly what was occurring here. Here, this was not a, \"Gee, we'd like to see what affects angiogenesis.\" Merck knew what affected angiogenesis. It had a structure. And if you look at page 42 of the supplemental appendix, you will see that structure. It knew exactly what that structure did and how it did it. It then tweaked it by changing, literally, three atoms to compare that activity with other activity, exactly the sorts of research that any drug innovator would do to verify that they have the best and most effective candidate. Then, with and with every single one of its experiments, it was examining information that was relevant to mechanism of action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. With 10 percent of the experiments, it was also running them in parallel with a series of analogs that were designed to look exactly like the RGD peptides, and to work exactly like the RGD peptides. And no rational drug innovator ever proceeds to clinical trials, nor does the FDA want it to, without conducting that research, because you don't spend millions of dollars for expensive toxicology studies until you know you've got the safest and most effective drug candidate. The FDA reviews that evidence, because it wants to know why you're proceeding with that candidate. And if you shift midstream to another lead, as Merck, in fact, did in this very case, the FDA wants to understand why. So each of those experiments, even in comparison, developed information that is relevant to the FDA. Thank you, Your Honors.\n Thank you, Mr. Rosenkranz. The case is submitted.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are two issues in this case. One concerns walking time, and the other concerns waiting time. And unless the Court has a different order, I'd propose to start with the walking time. Section 4(a)(1)'s language, which comes from the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was enacted in 1947, by its plain terms clearly covers the walking that's involved in these two cases. The statute, which is reproduced at the appendix of the petition, at 88(a), says that there is no mandatory compensation for, quote, \"walking to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\" It's difficult for me to imagine language that could more directly cover what we're dealing with in this particular case, because the Plaintiffs here are for IBP are employed to slaughter and to process beef. The employees at Barber Foods are employed to process chicken. And thus, the actual place where they perform those services are obviously on the lines where the processing takes place.\n I would have thought that, but we've held otherwise.\n Well, I don't know that we've I don't know of any case where this Court has held otherwise.\n Well, we've held that they're that the principal activity consists of doffing donning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?\n Well, this Court said that donning and doffing was a principal activity in contradistinction to a preliminary or postliminary activity for purposes of section 4(a)(2), but the Court specifically said, in Steiner, that that holding does not apply to matters that are specifically excluded under section 4(a)(1), which deals with walking time, Justice Scalia.\n So, you think Steiner is irrelevant?\n For no, I don't think it's irrelevant to the workplace. I think it is irrelevant to the proper disposition of this case, yes.\n Well, it is if we don't accept the continuous workday rule. If we do accept the continuous workday rule, why isn't it, in effect, the premise from which the conclusion for the other side falls?\n Well, we don't have any quarrel with the continuous workday rule. The question is, When does the workday begin? And our assessment of the workday, as defined in section 4(a)(1), which controls, specifically, the walking time in this particular case, begins when you arrive at the actual place where you're going to perform the services  \n No, but your argument  \n or primary activities.\n assumes that there is only one actual place. And their argument, which is consistent with the text of the statute, is that there may be more than one principal activity, and hence, more than one place. And if the if the place of donning and doffing is such a place, then wouldn't it be at least administratively odd to apply the continuous workday rule immediately to exclude some walking time that follows that?\n No, I don't think so. I think it is perfectly sensible and a clear bright-line rule, Justice Souter, to say that when you arrive at the actual place where you perform, not just any activities, and not just the activities that are integral and indispensable to your working activities, but to the principal activities for which you're hired and, admittedly, there can be more than one of those, but that doesn't you know, donning and doffing is not a principal activity  \n So, you're saying that  \n of anyone who's cutting beef.\n so-called \"integral activities\" are not principal activities.\n Right. They don't have to principal activities. They're better understood as  \n They felt otherwise.\n Mr. Phillips, I the Steiner opinion explicitly agreed with the lower court in that case, which said that the term \"principal activity or activities\" embraces all activities that are integral and indispensable.\n Right.\n And if if you think that putting on the clothes fall within that, then that covers walking, too  \n It  \n after that.\n The problem with that analysis is that the court was only analyzing section 4(a)(2) for these purposes. And what it was saying is, \"We are prepared to accept that there are certain activities that are either preliminary or postliminary, and then there are others that are primary activities. And if you are integral and indispensable to a primary activity, it is a compensable event.\" Recognizing that Steiner is probably the most extraordinarily extreme facts that you could imagine, because we're talking about clothings that had clothing that had to be changed in order to protect the public  \n But, Mr. Phillips  \n health and safety.\n you're asking us to interpret the same words, \"principal activity or activities,\" differently in sub (2) that was at issue in Steiner, and in sub (1), and then the clause that follows both of those. The same phrase is used. So if \"principal activity\" includes donning or doffing, under sub (2), why wouldn't the same follow for sub (1) and the following clauses?\n Because you have to read the language \"principal activity or activities\" in (a)(1) within the context of what Congress was trying to achieve by the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was to absolutely and categorically exclude walking time from being part of mandatorily compensated activities of a particular employee.\n But it is included if it's once the workday begins, if there's a rotation, you walk from one station to the other. That walking time, I think it's conceded, would be included.\n Right. But that  \n So, if your date if the principal activity is donning and doffing, then the walking time thereafter would also be included.\n But, Justice Ginsburg, if you step back and think about this language in the context of the words that are written here, it says, \"walking to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity.\" No one would think that that  \n \"Or activities.\"\n Or activities. But, again, Justice Souter, all that suggests is that there are times when somebody who's working in a clothing operation may you know, may spend time distributing the cloth or may spend time actually sewing the cloth. Those are two separate activities. They're different activities. But it doesn't mean and it certainly doesn't convert anything that had can be described as \"integral and indispensable\" into a primary activity which such employee is employed to perform. No employee, in these cases, was employed to perform the act of putting on clothes or the act of picking up equipment.\n What do you think about the possibility, \"it depends on the clothes and depends on the equipment,\" so that, in Steiner and here, it's a lot of protective gear, it's really quite part of the job and special and unusual. In Mt. Clemens, it's a kind of uniform. It's just washing your hands up, putting on an apron. So, where it's minor putting on clothes, as someone might in his house, doesn't come in substantial, doesn't come in integral and indispensable; but where it's quite a big deal, it does. And who decides? The agency.\n Well, there are two parts about that that are worth focusing on. One is, I don't think you can lump the two cases together, because the clothing or the equipment that has to be put on with respect to the Barber Foods company is barely is quite minimal and, indeed, was deemed to be diminimus. So, I'm not I'm not sure you can lump the two cases together in that way. But also, in terms of where the Secretary comes out on this, let's not forget 79.7(g), footnote 49, which is, candidly, the clearest statement from the Secretary with respect to, What do you do when you have donning and doffing that is followed by walking time? And what does the and what does the regulation specifically say? And that's on, I think, 92 and 93 of the appendix to our petition. It specifically says that that walking time is not excluded, not necessarily  \n Not necessarily excluded. It's really noncommittal on the point.\n Well, except that, under their theory of this case, it is always excluded. Always. So that whatever else you can say about the meaning of that particular language, the interpretation the Secretary offers to you today flatly rejects  \n But \"in certain\"  \n that language.\n that footnote that's where I actually got the idea it says, \"We reserve, in certain situations.\" To me, that meant sometimes it can be a major big deal to don clothing protective gear; sometimes it isn't an apron. And whose job is it? Now I'm repeating myself.\n Right.\n The Secretary's.\n No, but and if we were talking about that in the context of other kinds of activities if you're back in the (a)(2) world of looking at whether something's preliminary or postliminary, I have less of a problem with dealing with that. The problem is, here we're talking about (a)(1) activities, the core of what Congress enacted the Portal-to-Portal Act to protect employers for. The Portal-to-Portal Act is not a statute that remotely provides protections for the employees. This is a statute that was designed to protect employers from billions of dollars of liability. And so, when you're talking about, \"Under what circumstances can you ignore the flat prohibition on requiring walking time to be regarded as a mandatory subject of compensation?\" then it seems to me the distinction you're proposing doesn't work. And it's also, Justice Breyer, again, flatly inconsistent. Their that's not their theory of the case. Their theory of the case is, \"If we can describe it as in any way integral and indispensable to some other activity, that makes it a primary activity, that starts the workday, and everything after that then becomes compensable.\"\n Mr. Phillips, can I call your attention to the text of Section 254(a)? It's in the red brief in the Alvarez case, at App. 1. What it what it says is that you don't have to pay overtime compensation or minimum wages for and on account of any of the following activities: (1) \"walking, riding,\" blah, blah, blah. This is (1).\n Yes.\n for the \"place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform.\"\n Now you skipped over \"actual place,\" there  \n Right. Okay.\n Justice Scalia, but which I think is an important  \n Okay.\n word.\n (2) \"activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities.\" You're trying to sever (1) and (2), when the text itself joins them. The activities referred to in (2) are \"said principal activity or activities.\" The \"said\" refers to the ones that are in (1).\n Right. But that  \n How can we possibly sever (1) and (2) and say that for purposes of one, it means one thing; for purposes of two, it means something else?\n Because when the court was interpreting (a)(2) in Steiner, it wasn't interpreting (a)(2) to determine whether something was a postliminary activity in connection with \"said preliminary primary activities.\" What it was saying is, these are not preliminary and postliminary activities, that they are excluded from that. And so, the court's really coming up with what is a third category of cases, which deals with integral and indispensable activities to a primary activity. They didn't have to analyze it as a primary activity. All they had to say was, it's not that the preliminary and postliminary activities are not simply temporal, that there is a substantive component to it. And that is essentially the holding of the court in Steiner. It says there's a substantive component; and, therefore, we're not going to just simply look in time-wise, whether it comes before or after principal activities. We're going to decide that there are some there are some situations that are so important that they need to be compensated under (a)(2), because they don't fall within preliminary or postliminary language.\n But, Mr. Phillips, it says it either something is before, preliminary; or after, postliminary. And if it's neither of those, then, it seems to me, it fits it's not before the principal activity, and it's not after the principal activity, so what else is it, other than the  \n It's work  \n principal activity?\n that's mandatorily compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Remember, the Fair Labor Standards Act, under this Court's interpretations from Mt. Clemens Pottery and the cases that preceded it, I mean, it you know, it had a very sweeping definition of what is work within the meaning within the meaning of what is compensable as minimum wages and as overtime. And that's in place. And now Congress has stepped in and said, \"Well, wait a second. When we did it when that got interpreted that broadly, we're talking about $6 billion in liability.\" So, it's very important, given that we're talking about fairly minimal activities on the on the that are involved here, triggering potentially massive liabilities. And so, what we've done is, we've excluded from those massive liabilities the walking, riding, and traveling time, because that's the basis on which you end up with big numbers.\n So, your approach introduces, really, a third concept. You have the principal activities and you have either preliminary or postliminary and now you've got a third concept: integral. But the statute that's nowhere in the statute.\n Right. Well, I mean, that but that's this Court's decision in Steiner was the one that reached out to decide that \"integral and indispensable\" was a category of activities that were going to be compensable, even though, on the face of them, they may have appeared to be  \n Well, unless they were saying those activities were, in fact, principal activities. If it's integral, if it's embraced by the principal activity, it is a principal activity, and that at least is more consistent with the statute in keeping it in two categories rather than inventing a third.\n Well, I don't think that creates any particular problem, but what you end up doing, Mr. Chief Justice, under those circumstances, is, you completely eliminate the protection that Congress meant to provide here for walking, riding, and traveling time, which is which is a vital consideration  \n Well, how does how does your analysis apply? Let's say these employees had to change their equipment several times during the course of the day.\n You mean after they've  \n Yes, I mean, the  \n arrived at the actual place  \n the equipment is only good for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to get new ones. They have to walk back to the place  \n Right.\n they have to doff the other equipment, don new equipment, and walk back. Wouldn't your analysis say that that walking time is excluded?\n No. No. Once you  \n Why not?\n We don't have any quarrel with the argument that once you, for the first time, arrive at your actual place of performing the principal activity for which you were hired, which is cutting beef or whatever it happens to be in your hypothetical once you arrive there, that does begin the workday. That's the definition of what starts the workday, which is why I to our mind, this is a much clearer and brighter-line rule. We can tell you precisely when you start the workday. It's when you get to the place where you got hired to work, and start to do that work.\n But do you have compensated activities that do not begin the workday?\n Yes, you do have compensated and that's true for lots of different situations, Justice Kennedy. You could have a situation where you go home, and you get called back in on an emergency, and nobody disputes that that's clearly compensable time, and nobody has ever seriously argued that you ought to extend the workday  \n What happens with the microchip or a laboratory with highly contagious viruses where there's got to be two hours of scrubbing and then there's a walk? What do you do with that?\n If the  \n Two hours of scrubbing  \n You know, it's it's very possible that the scrubbing will be regarded as an integral and indispensable part of the of the of the employment, and  \n But then there's but then there's  \n therefore, it's compensable.\n but then there's a walk. What about the walk?\n The walk is not compensable, because Congress didn't want you to have walking until you got to the actual place where you would perform the services. And nobody's principal activity as an employee is to go take a shower or to go and pick up certain types of clothing. That's not  \n But the problem  \n the understanding of \"principal activity.\"\n Mr. Phillips, the problem I continue to have is that I thought Steiner embraced, explicitly, the notion that principal activity embraces all activities that are integral and indispensable. You take issue with that, but do you want us to overrule Steiner  \n No.\n or make some changes in it? I just don't understand.\n I want you to limit Steiner to the very unusual facts that arose in that particular context. I we don't have any quarrel with the \"indispensable and integral\" test as a reason for beginning as a reason for compensating certain activities.\n What was  \n What we do  \n so unusual about the facts  \n I'm sorry?\n What was so unusual about the facts in Steiner? They're pretty common.\n Well, no, I the notion that if you didn't shower and change, you would expose not only yourself, but your family and everybody else to the risks of lead poisoning is a pretty extraordinary  \n No, but the  \n circumstance.\n the routine where you have to don, you know, safety equipment, and you have to shower when you're done, whether it's being the meatpacking or the stuff at Steiner that's a pretty common occurrence.\n Right, well, I would I would argue that you could make a you could make a claim that none of that donning and doffing ought to be compensable. And, candidly, we've made that argument. But, unfortunately, the court didn't grant the petition on that particular on that particular question. So, we have to take it as a given. But I don't I don't I for exactly the reason you identify, Mr. Chief Justice, that does create a problem. I mean, part of this problem is a bit contrived. I don't think that the ordinary donning and doffing ought to trigger the beginning of the workday. But, assuming that it does  \n But you're saying  \n I still don't think I'm sorry, Justice Souter.\n No, no, I didn't mean finish.\n But I still don't think that, even if you accept that that is compensable conduct within the meaning of Steiner, which I that's what it's talking about but Steiner, Justice O'Connor, doesn't say anything about the fact that there was going to have to be walking or traveling, or the workday. The court, in Steiner, clearly had in mind the workplace, where you're producing batteries. There's a lot of language in that opinion that says, \"This is where you really do the work. That's your battery, and here's where you're going to get engage in activities that we think you need to be compensated.\" But the court never remotely suggested that you were entitled to the walking time between those two. And, if you go back to 790.7(g), that language specifically told every employer that simply because you have to pay for certain kinds of activities at the outset, because they're integral and indispensable, as decided by a court, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to pay for all the walking time. And so, you've got to come up with  \n You would say that's  \n a theory that supports that.\n so for all activities that are that are integral and indispensable? What about sharpening tools?\n Well, sharpening tools is the easiest one, because you do that right on your workplace. I mean, that's exactly what Congress had in mind in its legislative history  \n No, no, no.\n But your  \n But that's but suppose  \n but your time shouldn't start from then.\n that's not the hypothetical. Suppose you sharpen the tools outside, by your locker, and then you then you go for a 10-minute walk to get to the and you carry the sharpened tool?\n Well, again, if the Court decided that sharpening the tools, even though it's done not at the same time, which is what Congress had in mind when it when it identified that hypothetical but, even if you assume that, that that's integral and indispensable, it still isn't what triggers the time for starting the actual employment.\n No, but isn't your in the answer that you just gave, and an answer which you have, in fact, consistently repeated, inconsistent with Steiner Steiner didn't say there is a separate category of integral activities. Steiner said that activities which are integral are part of the principal activity. And isn't your argument premised on denying that identity?\n No, I can accept that identity for purposes of distinguishing between what's preliminary and postliminary activity. What I cannot do is to is embrace that for purposes of deciding when walking time/traveling time ought to be included. Congress was as plain as it could humanly be in saying that, \"We're not going to allow walking and traveling time to be included in an unexpected fashion.\" And that is precisely as the Chamber of Commerce brief says, that is precisely what we're talking about here. And, candidly, as Judge Boudin said in his concurring opinion, the circumstances arising in this context bear a very eery resemblance to the situation that gave rise to the Portal-to-Portal Act in the first place. And so and I think it's important to put this into context. You know, the language of the statute, as I read it, clearly is in our favor. The purpose of the statute is clearly in our favor. And then the question is, Did this Court, in a decision that dealt solely with 4(a)(2), mean to vastly change the scope of 4(a)(1) in a way that would dramatically expose employers to liability  \n Why is it  \n and  \n why is it so dramatic, if we recognize that nothing begins until the donning and doffing that is, the travel to wherever you don and doff?\n Well  \n None of that is included, even from the plant gate to the place where you don and doff.\n But the well, in part, because plants are not have never been designed remember, we've got 79.6 the Secretary of Labor told employers for 50 years, \"You can set up your plant without fearing that you're going to suddenly be hit with walking time after somebody engages in donning and doffing, even if it turns out to be integral and indispensable.\" For 50 years, they followed that advice. They set up all of their plants with that expectation. And now this Court, if it follows the ninth circuit's lead, will suddenly say, \"Okay, what you need to go out and find is all of the integral and indispensable activities\" not just donning and doffing any integral and indispensable activity that you can get a court to buy into, that will start this ever-expanding workday, such that any walking that goes on after that and before you get done with all of these ever-expanding post-doffing activities. Then you have the that's you know, so you have this broad and that's why you're going to have these substantially greater and totally unexpected liabilities on the workplace.\n Where is that advice contained, that you say was given to  \n 790.7(g), footnote 49, and it says, as  \n Not  \n plain as day  \n not necessarily.\n Right, but there there, it means always. Always.\n And you say that they operated on the assumption that it meant never.\n No, I'm prepared to  \n It seems to me they were on notice that, although it did not, necessarily, it might. I think you're  \n It might, and but  \n you're exaggerating the effect of that statement.\n But, Justice Scalia  \n That's right, they don't say I mean, they exclude, for example, the canine cases, where you have to walk and feed the dog in the morning before you show up at work. So  \n Well, the  \n they're not saying only  \n the Secretary does. I don't know whether the plaintiffs necessarily do. And certainly the plaintiffs in those cases didn't. They took the position that the workday started as soon as you engaged in protecting the canines, just as in insurance industry, they the insurance adjusters are all taking the position that as soon as they have to get on the computer, that's an integral and indispensable part of their day, and everything after that, including traveling and movement, are all part and parcel of what gets added in there. What I'm suggesting to you is that once you go down this path and you say, \"Okay, we're going to define the workday by reference to whatever somebody determines is integral and indispensable,\" you are going to have an expandable workday, and that if you are really looking for a fairly clear rule, you sit you stick with what the language of the statute says, which is, the actual place of the performance of the activity for which you were hired. Once you've got that in place that's not to say that's the full length of when you get compensated. You can be compensated for activities outside of that workday. Happens every day, when you have to come in for an emergency or if you have to come in  \n My problem with your argument is Steiner.\n I understand the problem with Steiner, Justice Kennedy, but I think it is inappropriate to read Steiner, which says, point-blank, \"Our holding does not deal with conduct that is specifically excluded by 4(a)(1),\" and then and ignore that. That whole that statement of the holding of the court seems to me to say, \"All we're telling you the answer to\"  \n No, it doesn't.\n \"is 4(a)(2).\"\n The only thing specifically included in (a)(1) is walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities. And once you assume that \"principal activity or activities\" includes everything that's integral and essential to principal activities, (a)(1) doesn't cover it.\n No, you can get to the logic of that. The question is, Is it appropriate to apply the \"integral and indispensable\" test, which is an atextual standard, in a way that essentially guts 4(a)(1) and the fundamentally important values that it was designed to serve? And what I'm suggesting to you is, that's a mistake. And we know that, because the regs protected us against this precise event. It is exactly what the Portal-to-Portal Act was designed to accomplish, and it's the better interpretation of this particular statute.\n Mr. Phillips, may I just ask you a preliminary question about the IBM case IP IBP  \n IBP.\n IBP case? As I understand it, whatever we do here is irrelevant to what the bottom line is going to be in that case, because the determination is going to be made only under State law. The court below said that's what it was going to do. And the employees are not objecting. So, it seems that that case, as distinguished from Tum, is really not anything that this Court should decide, because it would be academic.\n Well, they don't argue that it's moot. And it's not purely academic. There are collateral consequences to deciding what the Federal law issue is in this particular context. We briefed this issue at the cert stage at some length, and the court granted cert, so I'm assuming that, in some respects, you, sort of, pass by that particular problem. There are collateral consequences. And the other side, again, doesn't say it's that it has mooted this case; it simply says that there's this serious issue on remand as to precisely how it'll all play out.\n Could you give us a collateral consequence? I mean that is  \n Yes, because it reas judicata collateral estoppel effects from the ruling that we've that we have violated federal law, both that might be available to the Secretary of Labor and otherwise. If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the  \n Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\n balance of my minutes.\n Mr. Goldstein.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As the previous questioning suggests, the outcome of this case follows directly from Steiner. The Portal Act, by its terms, applies only to activities that occur before the commencement of before the commencement of, or after the conclusion of, the employees' principal activities. Steiner holds that donning and doffing, such as in this case, is \"part of\" that's a quote the employees' principal activities, and it, therefore, follows that the Portal Act applies only to activities either prior to, or after, that donning and doffing.\n But why isn't walking from the gate of the of the factory to the to the place where you're on the assembly line, why isn't that integral and essential to the performing of the activities?\n Because and this is the language that Mr. Phillips is referring to in Steiner 4(a)(1) itself makes clear that a walk will not be the first principal activity, including on the theory that it's integral and indispensable. The first principal activity has to be something other than a walk, and that's what happens in this case. As in Steiner, there is donning at the beginning of the day. That's part of the principal activities  \n No, no, but if once you accept the theory that the principal activity includes those things that are integral, you can say walking from the gate of the plant to the assembly line is part of the principal activity. Now, walking to the gate may not be part of the may not be part of the principal activity, but I  \n Two reasons, Justice Scalia. The first is the one that I gave, and that is, the Steiner Court concluded that and that was the end of the sentence, where it said, \"except as excluded by 4(a)(1),\" that Congress made clear in 4(a)(1) that the initial walk wouldn't be the first principal activity. Second, the walk won't be integral and indispensable. The test for whether or not something is integral and indispensable is whether it's work that's required and closely related to the productive activities. And simply walking to the donning station is not. That's in contradistinction to putting on the clothes that are required here, required as a matter of law in order to do your job. That's the line that the statute draws.\n Well, what about the dog grooming cases?\n The dog cases, Justice Kennedy and I let me make sure we're I have your hypothetical, and that is, the police officer at home grooms the dog  \n Yes.\n then comes into the office. That is part of their principal activities. The subsequent commute is not compensable, on the ground that it is a break and a commute. That's covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Portal Act is concerned with something else that is, before the beginning and after the end of your day. The dog cases are, of course, also entirely different from this one. You have you have arrived at the place of the performance of your principal activity. Steiner said that occurred, quote/unquote, \"on or off the production floor.\" And so, you're at the plant, and your workday has started. Justice Scalia, you made the point, and I simply want to reinforce it, that the reference in to \"principal activities\" in 4(a)(2) is the same as the reference to \"principal activities\" in 4(a)(1), but it's also the reference to principal activities in the concluding clause of section 4. If I could just take the Court to that. The statute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places, but it's also at page 3 of our brief. And so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this concluding clause, and the text frames the workday. And it says that the Portal Act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply to activities which occur I'm quoting now \"which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.\" And it simply follows, as a matter of the plain text, that when Steiner held that those activities, \"such principal activities,\" include the donning and the doffing, that everything that happens between those two events is not encompassed by the Portal Act.\n Your  \n What if what if  \n answer to Justice Kennedy said that the dog cases were distinguishable because there was a break in the principal activity. So, if we were to rule in your favor, all the employer has to do is make sure that the donning and doffing station's far enough away from the production line so that there will be a sufficient break between the two activities.\n Well, the both the donning and the doffing and the walking in between and the wait for the equipment, which is the bulk of the time in all these cases, would be compensable. The Department of Labor has regulations  \n What do you mean \"it would be\" that's my question.\n Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. There the donning and doffing in the Alvarez case, by and large, happens in one place: in a locker room. In the Tum case, by contrast, the employees show up at a cage, they wait for things, they walk, they pick up something else, they wait, they pick up something else. And so, there's a body of time that I refer to as the donning and doffing process. All of that would clearly be compensable, even in your hypothetical. Your hypothetical would address the final piece of time, and that is, you get your last piece of clothing on, and you have to go to the floor, and the employer could say, \"Take a 15 minute break,\" in there. I suppose that's hypothetically possible. I think the reason it doesn't happen in these cases and in the other cases I've studied is that the employer has an incentive, when they're forced to compensate, to do things efficiently. What happens is, the employer will say, \"All right, your shift is going to start at 6:30 in the morning; therefore, you can clock in and start donning at 6:23.\" That's a 7-minute window, and that forces the employees to do everything efficiently. They don't insert artificial breaks.\n Yes, but why if you're talking about efficiency, it may well be that the employees, instead of imposing upon the employer the costs of moving the donning and doffing location closer to the to the place where the real work is being done, they might prefer, instead, to get a slight salary increase per hour. But and that is that is possible, under the petitioner's scheme, because it is left to private negotiation; whereas, what you say is that they must pay for that. They must pay for that walk from the donning and doffing. They cannot negotiate out of it, because if it's in the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is mandatory. So I don't talk to us about efficiency. It seems to me that the efficiency arguments are on the other side. Leave it to the private sector. The employers the employees can decide what they care more about.\n Well, Justice Scalia, I all I have in before me that I can rely on is the statute that Congress enacted. Your point would cover, of course, equally, the donning and doffing in Steiner itself. Congress made some choices about things that were going to be compensable. It's worth noting that Congress drew a line about whether in terms of whether there was a collective bargaining agreement involved, because under section 203(o) of the statute, in workplaces covered by a collective bargaining agreement, you can negotiate out of at least clothes changing. But I think within the framework of the statute that we do have, I am actually quite correct, and that is, right now, today, the employers have no incentive to adopt an efficient scheme for arranging donning and doffing. They can put things in different buildings if they like. The employees here are required to spend 10 or 20 minutes waiting for different clothing at different times, depending on how long the lines are. It is a workable scheme that Congress designed that said, \"We're going to have a workday.\" And the employer is in charge of deciding when the workday begins or ends, but, during that workday, they're going to have to pay. I did want to  \n Mr. Goldstein, I just wanted to have a clear answer to the question Justice Scalia asked you. Is it so that collective bargaining could not trade off the compensation for the walking and the donning and doffing for some other benefit that the employees might prefer?\n Justice Ginsburg, it is an unsettled question, is the answer. I will give you the best answer I can. 203(o) allows for the negotiation away of clothes changing time. The question whether clothes-changing time includes safety equipment is a matter in dispute. The ninth circuit held that it didn't. This Court denied certiorari on that question. The further question, if you did negotiate away the clothes changing time, whether that would negotiate away the walking and waiting time has not been confronted by a court, so far as I am aware. It might be said to logically follow, but it hasn't been decided. It's not presented by this case, because cert was denied. And so, I haven't thought very much  \n So, you say it's an open question.\n It is. I'm confident it's an open question.\n What  \n Could  \n about what gear qualifies? That is, here we have no dispute that this is protective gear. But it's not any changing that counts. So, how do we know whether this is the kind of donning and doffing that's compensated in or the kind that isn't?\n The line that has been drawn by the Department of Labor, is where I will start, and the Department of Labor and let me give you some citations says that the line is between whether the employer requires you to do the donning and doffing on the plant or not. The citations for that are section 785.24(c) of the regulations, 790, note 65. And then it contrasts clothes-changing that's by your own choice, in 790.7(g). I think that's a sensible line, but it's not presented by this case. Justice Breyer, it goes to your characterization of the final sentence of footnote 49, and that is: sometimes. The reason I think it's sensible to draw the line that the Department has in required clothes changing is that the employer will only require you to do it onsite if it is truly integral and indispensable to your job; otherwise, it'll be optional, or they'll let you do it at  \n Can I ask you about a the other part of the case? I mean, I think, as I've suggested, most of these things are up to the agency. They're minor things in law, so but it seems well established in the agency reg, as well as in Skidmore, the famous line about waiting being, \"Are you waiting to be engaged, or are you engaged to wait?\" So, assuming that this is just putting on and off clothes that are essential so, assume you win on that part when they wait to put on the clothes, you would think if it's like an airport, sometimes you wait; if you're lucky, you don't. Well, under those circumstances, you wouldn't be engaged to wait. You're waiting to put on the clothes, not you know, etcetera so, why would you win on that part?\n Can I, again, make sure I have the hypothetical in terms we are, in a sense, talking about the first wait. You show up at the first  \n The what happens you win on the  \n Yes.\n clothes. They're protected gear. That's the assumption. That's part of the job. The workday begins. But you have to get there, and you wait to get the clothes. On that  \n But  \n one, why not Skidmore? Why not the reg? And, if so, why don't you lose on that one?\n You are in that situation, you're waiting for the very first piece of equipment. In the Tum case, you show up at the cage at the beginning of the day. You are engaged to wait. The regulatory citations are two: 790.6(b) and 790.7(h). There's also a case that's confronted this, which is the Metzler case, 127 F.3d 959. All those authorities make clear that if the employer tells you, \"Show up to do something, show up here to put on your clothes,\" and, because of the way the employer has designed the system, you have to wait, through no fault of your own  \n But suppose sometimes you have to wait? Sometimes it's a minute, sometimes it's nothing. Is it like an airport? Or does the employer here say, \"You must show up seven minutes early, because there'll be a wait\"?\n It's the it would be the same result whether the employer puts a time on it or not. The employer says I'll give you an example we could agree on, when it's a time  \n Is that what the reg says?\n The reg doesn't  \n It's surprising I didn't see that in the reg, if it says that.\n The regulation gives this example, which I think is on point, and that is, if you are told to show up for when the production begins the meat's going to come across and the machine breaks down or they simply don't start sending the meat until five minutes later, the fact is that you get compensated, because you're supposed to be there. The fact that they tell you, \"Be there for the\"  \n Where it's first in the day.\n Yes.\n First thing  \n Yes.\n in the day.\n Yes. Unquestionably.\n I thought you would say that the whole principle of, you know, \"Are you engaged to wait, or waiting to be engaged?\" just contradicts the principle that was adopted in Steiner. I mean, are you putting are you employed to put on your to put on your clothes, or are you putting on your clothes to do your work? And Steiner essentially repudiates that. So, you know, let's forget about Skidmore.\n Well, Justice Scalia, I think Justice Breyer is testing a very particular piece of time.\n No, I understand.\n He's trying to say, What is let me take you to the text of the statute  \n No, I  \n The he's trying to figure out when the the final clause of 4(a) talks about commencement he want to know when it commences. Does it commence when you get in line or when you  \n Right.\n first get the piece of clothes? It's a fair question. The other side hasn't made any argument that it doesn't include the first wait, I think, because you're told that you have to don, it's part of your principal activity. Let me also say, this, I think, is a somewhat academic question when it comes to and nothing against academics, but the it's a somewhat academic question when it comes to actual workplaces, because what happens is what I described before, the employers, under employers that are following our rule, do set up a time clock, and they say, \"Show up at 6:23, and that's when you can clock in.\" They have computerized swipe cards, and the computer won't recognize them until 6:23. And it's the time after that that will be compensable. So, if the Court were to say the donning and doffing process starts and ends the workday for purposes of the Portal Act, everyone will understand what the  \n That wasn't decided below, was it? It was just a question of walking and waiting, and they weren't specific about whether that included waiting or walking, predonning.\n That's right. The reason for that is, there isn't a predonning wait in the Alvarez case, where the plaintiffs won, and the Tum plaintiffs lost on an unrelated theory that the actual donning and doffing couldn't start the workday.\n So, perhaps we shouldn't reach a question that hasn't been aired and decided below.\n And my formulation, which is simply the donning and doffing process, would, in fact, leave the to the lower courts the question of precisely when donning begins and doffing ends. That's a fair point.\n Mr. Goldstein, since you display such respect for the agency here [Laughter.]\n what do you do about the agency's footnote that flatly contradicts your theory of the case, and which says that the mere fact that donning and doffing may require compensation does not necessarily mean that travel between the clothes changing place and the actual place of performance would be excluded?\n Justice Scalia, my answer, I think, is that you had it right in the first half hour, and that is, that phrase [Laughter.]\n \"not necessarily,\" can mean one of two things; i.e., we're denying that it follows a fortiori, or we're simply not deciding the question. The agency itself, which the Secretary wrote this guidance the agency explains that it meant that we're simply not deciding it. That's actually perfectly intelligible and a correct understanding of the history. Remember, the Portal Act gets enacted, and, right afterwards, the Secretary issues this guidance that then gets put in the CFR. This was their first reaction to the Act. Subsequently, after several years, these are what you're referring to is something in the what are known as the Part 790 guidance. Later on, the Secretary issued what's called the Part 785 guidance. And, in 785.3, it said, anything that, in 785, contradicts 790, controls. And 785.38 is the relevant citation. And there they say, \"If you show up at the beginning of the day and you're given instructions, or you show up at the beginning of the day and you get a set of tools, what follows after that, in terms of travel time, is compensable.\" Can I answer two make two other very quick points? Justice Ginsburg, you asked about mootness. I would refer you to the Deposit Guarantee case, 445 U.S. 326, which talks about collateral estoppel effects. There is ongoing litigation against this defendant on this question, a case called Chavez, in the district court. The citation for the proposition that it will collaterally estop them is the restatement section of judgments, section  \n I wasn't questioning that, so much as it is it is extraordinary for this Court to take a case when the bottom line is going to be the same. And, since we have the identical issues, with no such preliminary question in Tum, if we decide in your favor in the Tum case, then the other case is taken care of.\n It's true, you could dig the case. My only point is that it is not moot. And perhaps the variety of workplaces shown in the two cases would illustrate things for the lower courts. I suspect that may have been why the Court granted cert. I also wanted to respond to the suggestion that this is a surprise to industry, with just a couple of citations. Walking and waiting time has been held compensable since at least 1961. The Mitchell case, 286 F.2d 721, the Barrentine case, 750 F.2d 47. There was a meatpacking plant at least seven years ago, 127 F.3d 959. And this has been the agency's enforcement position at least since the late 1980s. It's sufficiently settled that the court of appeals here held that IBP's failure to pay for this time was a willful violation of the statute. If there are no further questions.\n Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. Mr. Gornstein.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Portal Act excludes walking time from compensation only when it occurs outside the workday, before an employee commences, or after he ceases, his principal activities. And Steiner held that the term \"principal activities\" includes activities that are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities. It follows that when donning and doffing are integral and indispensable parts of the principal activities of the employees, then walking that occurs after donning, and before doffing, occurs within the workday, and it is not excluded from compensation by the Portal Act. Now, the employers in these cases have argued that the term \"principal activities\" does not encompass activities that are integral and indispensable parts thereof, and that Steiner did not so hold. But, at the very outset of its opinion, the Court, in Steiner, posed the question presented as whether changing clothes and showering are compensable as part of the employee's principal activities, and had answered that question several pages later by stating that it agreed with the conclusion of the court of appeals in that case that the term \"principal activities\" includes activities that are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities, and that the activities in question in that case fit within that description. Now, that was the only textual basis on which the Court could have reached the conclusion that it did, because, if the only principal activities in that case had occurred on the production floor, then the changing of clothes at the beginning of the day, and the showering at the end of the day, necessarily would have been preliminary to and postliminary to said principal activities, and thereby expressly excluded from compensation.\n What if I think that opinion was just flatly wrong, that Congress, when it referred to the \"principal activity or activities,\" was talking about the cutting of the meat or whatever the employer hired the person to do? He didn't hire him to put on clothes. What if I think that? Why do I have to extend what I think to be an erroneous decision beyond its narrow holding?\n Justice Scalia, we are not asking for an extension of what you would regard as an erroneous holding. All we're saying is that you read the term \"principal activities\" as the Court interpreted it in Steiner. Once you do that, and you plug it into the statute, the plain language of the statute takes over, because it says that walking is only excluded when it comes before the employee commences, or after he ceases, the principal activities. Once you plug \"integral and indispensable\" into that sentence, as Steiner requires, then you are the plain language of the statute tells you that that time is not is compensable when it occurs after donning and before doffing.\n Why can't I say that Steiner requires that interpretation of what constitutes a \"principal activity\" only for purposes of determining what is compensable, and that when we when we come to examine the separate question, of when the workday begins, we can we can apply, as far as precedent is concerned, a different interpretation of what is a \"principal activity\"?\n Because the term \"principal activity,\" I believe, as, you yourself, pointed out, is listed in the first at (a)(1). That's the first place it appears. Everywhere else it appears, including in (a)(2) and in the concluding sentence, it says \"said principal activities.\" So, the statute itself tells you that the term \"principal activities\" has to mean the same thing everywhere it appears. And since you have already interpreted that term, in Steiner, to include \"integral and indispensable activities,\" that terminology has to appear everywhere in the statute.\n Mr. Gornstein, do you agree that just because it's a compensable activity doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't going to be a break in the workday? People have talked about the dog example, and there are others. I mean, and so, all you're talking about is the determination that this is a principal activity. It seems that there's a separate second question, which is, How do we tell if the space in time between two different principal activities, and they're two very different types of activities, is a break or part of the continuous workday?\n Well, first of all, that question arises not under the Portal Act, which only applies before the principal activities begin and after they end, but under the Fair Labor Standards Act, itself. And that question would be governed by the Court's prior decisions on what constitutes hours worked, together with the Department of Labor's regulations that address what constitute hours worked. And within the workday and what the Department of Labor has said is, generally, everything within the workday is compensable, except for a meal period and except for a time period where there is a break that is so substantial that the employees can effectively use that time for their own purposes. And so, it says things like 5- to 20-minute breaks are not periods where the employee is not working, but they are resting for the further work. That is common in the industry. And so, that would be an issue that would arise when you had a break that was much longer than that, probably at least a half hour, where you can actually effectively use that time for your own purposes and are not required, essentially, to stay around on the employer's premises and to wait or rest to begin your work anew. So  \n I take it you then agree that the answer for which you argue here follows not merely from the text of 4(a), but the text of 4(a) plus a continuous some variety of a continuous workday rule.\n That's correct.\n You've got to have both.\n That you that you have to have a work under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and then you have to have the exclusion from that not apply.\n Yes.\n The issue here, the exclusion doesn't apply, and nobody has raised the question about whether this is hours worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act. But clearly it is, under the Court's decisions.\n But you don't but you don't get the answer from simply the text itself.\n That's correct.\n Did you say  \n Mr. Gornstein, what about in the Tum case, the walking and waiting before the donning of the clothes?\n Yes. On the on the waiting before the clothes, there's there are two series of waits: the first wait and then later waits. As to the later waits, once you decide that the donning begins the process of principal activities  \n I'm talking about the  \n The initial wait.\n these. The initial.\n The initial wait  \n You don't think that's covered.\n We do think that's covered. And under the Department of Labor's approach is to treat a required wait for an activity as an integral part of that activity. So, if that activity is, itself, compensable as a principal activity, then the required wait for that would also be  \n But the word  \n compensable as part of that.\n \"required\" is what I didn't understand in that. My airline example, what's required?\n What the the Department distinguishes  \n \"Required\" is sometimes there's a wait, sometimes there's not a wait. Is that required?\n Well, if the employee is simply voluntarily arriving earlier than  \n He has to  \n he has to and wait  \n put on his uniform. And sometimes there's a wait, sometimes there's  \n When  \n not a wait.\n If  \n Is that a required or not? And, if it is, where does it say that in the regs?\n It's a required wait anytime, in order to get to the production floor on time, the employee has to be at the donning station in a sufficient period of time to get there, and if there's a wait at that time, then he's being required to wait.\n Mr. Goldstein acknowledged that that issue, the predonning wait, was not decided below.\n I'm not sure I view that the the question as not having been decided below. And the Court also did grant certiorari on waiting time.\n But it wasn't, obviously, decided in the first circuit, because they ruled against the employee's position.\n But they said \"a reasonable period of time for waiting\" is non-compensable. And that, at least as a general rule, is not  \n But the but the question of when what waiting are we talking about? Before the principal activity or only after? That specific issue, as I understand it, was not aired below.\n Well, I'm my memory, at least, of the court of appeals opinion, is that it was saying that the wait before the donning was not compensable, because it was a preliminary activity. But I if you've read it differently, then that may be  \n Do we have to decide the second question? I think it's actually quite difficult. I can find a lot of authority that seems to me just  \n The Court always has discretion not to decide  \n No, no, no.\n the question.\n I don't mean that.\n It's  \n I mean, is there is there a basis in this record will it make a difference? It's not really well briefed, I don't think.\n I the  \n It's not thoroughly briefed.\n Justice Breyer, if you do not want to decide that question, you don't have to decide it.\n I don't do things on the ground  \n The Court granted  \n I'd like it or not.\n certiorari as an issue that can be, and should be, resolved, in our view. But if the Court doesn't want to resolve that issue, that's fine.\n Mr. Gornstein, one thing I'm curious about. With all the trouble of various interpretations and famous footnote 49  \n 49.\n why, in all these years, hasn't the Department of Labor gotten rid of it? [Laughter.]\n It should have. Because even at the time it was written, that reservation was in tension or not in conflict with the plain language of the regulations. And certainly by the time of Steiner, it was clear that this kind of time was compensable.\n Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Phillips, you have four minutes remaining.\n Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I just have a couple of points I'd like to make. First, Justice Breyer, I want to start with the waiting times. I didn't actually have an opportunity to spend much time talking about them. But I think the answer that the Solicitor General's Office has offered with respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the expandable nature of the workday. Their position Justice Ginsburg or, no Justice O'Connor specifically asked that question, \"You're not saying that waiting time prior to engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the workday.\" And the answer is, absolutely, it does, because they find that everything that is integral and indispensable triggers the start of the workday. So, to put it into fairly graphic terms. If you have to show up in order to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in order to do your services, then the waiting time for that coat counts. If, however, you also have to put in earplugs in order to get to the place where you have to get the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count, under that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have that, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking in between there. So, if you're asking, \"Is this going to become a significant liability?\" the answer is clearly yes. For very significant compensable acts and, indeed, in this context, some of those compensable acts were found by the jury to be utterly diminimus you're going to end up with significant waiting time, and you're going to end up with significant walking time.\n Was the predonning waiting issue decided below?\n Yes, Justice O'Connor, they specifically held that all of the waiting time is not it is to be excluded. And they did that on the basis of 790.7(g), before you get to the footnote because that's the tag to the footnote as to what is what is the ordinary meaning of wait of preliminary and postliminary for waiting time? And the expectation is that if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're waiting to check in, the recognition is that those those are completely fortuitous, just as it is here. There's nobody who structured this arrangement so that you will end up spending time waiting. Indeed, the scheme is designed to get people in as efficiently  \n They decided  \n as possible.\n no waiting time. They didn't decide \"if\" waiting time \"which\" waiting time. But they said no it's irrelevant whether it's before or after, because waiting time isn't covered. So, I don't see how they specifically decided, yes, waiting time is covered, but not  .\n Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, if they specifically decide that there is no waiting time that's covered here, and the plaintiffs have sought compensation for both pre- and post-waiting time, then the issue is squarely posed, and they've certainly posed it in their petition, and the Court granted it. So, again, obviously, you're free to decline to decide issues, but it seems to me that one is posed. I want to  \n Well, it seems the court below said waiting time isn't covered, so we're not going to engage in any debate about what if waiting time is - were covered, which waiting time?\n Right, but that just goes to the question I think it disposes of the issue of, if you have waiting time that otherwise looks to be fairly ordinary preliminary/postliminary activity, it, nevertheless, can be converted into primary activity under their interpretation of the statute. And they clearly suggest that the answer is yes. Our suggestion is, that's inconsistent with the way waiting time is handled under the regulations; and, therefore, the answer clearly should be no. And, at a minimum, the Court ought to affirm that part of the Tum decision. With respect to the holding of Steiner I mean, it's important to put in mind, Steiner one of the things two things that Steiner focused on it focused on section 3.0, and it recognized that there are going to be situations where you're going to be able to bargain away clothes changing. And so, now you're in a situation where, for some for in some circumstances, because you've bargained away compensation for clothes changing, walking that takes place before or after that will never be compensable; in other situations, it will be compensable. That's an absurd outcome in a situation where Congress clearly had one thing in mind that it absolutely wanted to accomplish, and that was to ensure that walking, riding, traveling to the place where you actually perform the services for which you've been hired, has been has is excluded from being mandatorily compensated Steiner doesn't deal with 4(a)(1); the language is as plain as it can be are not you know, unless specifically excluded by section 4(a)(1). Thank you, Your Honors.\n Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) for the sole purpose of increasing the penalties for money laundering conspiracies. Congress did not intend to abandon the overt act requirement from money laundering conspiracies and for good reason. The list of specified unlawful activities under 1956 is vast. Anytime two or more people conspire or reach an agreement to commit a crime that generates economic proceeds, invariably the discussion will lead to what they're going to do with the money get that gets generated, how they're going to spend the money, which is a potential 1957 offense, or how they're going to hide the money, a potential 1956 offense. The Government would charge these agreements as money laundering conspiracies without there even being a single overt act to demonstrate that criminal intent had crystallized, that a money laundering conspiracy was really afoot, and that steps were being taken to launder money, oftentimes triggering substantially higher penalties for the underlying offense, and subverting subverting the overt act requirement for conspiracy to commit the underlying offense.\n Would you just clarify one thing for me? Did they have to prove an overt act in order to establish venue?\n Excuse me?\n Does the Government have to prove an overt act in order to establish venue?\n Our position is that the venue provision in 1956(h) for a money laundering conspiracies requires that they establish an overt act and that venue would lie  \n Well, your you say the the statute requires. I'm just asking if it independently of the conspiracy statute of the the substantive statute itself, how do they establish venue. Do they have to prove an overt act just for the purpose of getting a venue established  \n Yes.\n as they do  \n Is that the only basis for venue? I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just one of the bases for venue.\n Our position is that the venue provision in 1956, 1956(i), is the exclusive venue provision for money laundering.\n But but read it. What does it say?\n Are we talking about section 1956(i)?\n Section 1956(i) is the venue provision.\n And doesn't it allow it to be brought where venue would lie if the completed money laundering offense that's the object of the conspiracy has been accomplished or anywhere an overt act was committed? Isn't it an either/or?\n Yes. Our position is that when you read the venue  \n So you don't have to read it as requiring venue. It's just requiring an overt act. If there is an overt act, then venue will lie, but it also will lie where the completed offense would have occurred.\n Certainly, but where the completed offense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts. You know, it's inherent in completing the money laundering transaction that there would be overt acts as part of the financial transaction.\n But why would they state it in the alternative if why would they state it in the alternative if the overt act were always required? That's the  \n I agree that it's it's somewhat confusing, Your Honor, but we would submit that the Government's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if two people conspired in if two people in Florida conspired to commit a money laundering offense in California, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy would lay in California.\n But that doesn't respond to the venue question. Venue, as written in this statute and in most statutes, is permissive. It gives you a choice of forum. It doesn't limit. In in the times when venue is exclusive, Congress is explicit in telling you that, but ordinarily a venue provision, as this one, either/or, is permissive. It would be extraordinary to make a venue provision exclusive.\n Well, this Court has made venue provisions exclusive in the patent infringement context and in the Banking Act precisely using the  \n Well, this Court has no authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or permissive. Congress decides that.\n And our position is that Congress made this venue provision the exclusive venue provision  \n I I mean, one can understand that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may be brought in any in let's see may be brought in the district where venue would lie for the completed if it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place, then we could argue about whether that is the exclusive venue or not. But I don't see how there is even an argument that it's the exclusive venue when you're dealing with a provision which says that a prosecution may be brought in the district where the where venue would lie for the completed offense or in any other district where an act in furtherance took place. How can you possibly read that to say that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in furtherance took place?\n Our position is that those are the two alternatives for where venue would lie for a conspiracy case.\n Oh, okay, but but then then you acknowledge that the place where an overt act took place is not the exclusive venue.\n Our argument is that the first clause of that provision contemplates the existence of an overt act.\n What about the rule provision for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute? The ordinary provision for venue.\n The ordinary provision for venue would be that venue lies in the district where the crime occurs.\n Yes.\n That would be in the money laundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h), that would be where the overt act occurs. So it would be consistent with it. Our  \n I thought the crime is the conspiracy. The overt act may be an additional requirement.\n The overt act is part of it's our position that the overt act is required, and there needs to be an agreement  \n But you will you will concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy crimes, in which an overt act is not required. The Shabani case requires you to recognize that.\n Correct. And in those cases where all that's required is an agreement, then venue would lie where the agreement occurs, but in this case, because the the offense requires an agreement plus an overt act, it's our position that that's where venue would lie. As a practical matter, if there is if if this Court construes 1956(h) as requiring overt act, as a practical matter, anytime two people agree to commit a money laundering conspiracy in one district and commit overt acts in another district in furtherance of that, it would be highly unlikely that there would not be some overt act in the district where they agreed to commit the offense.\n So you're saying that it doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be hard to prove.\n As a  \n But there are I mean, the difference between statutes that say overt act is required and those that just say conspiracy there are many, many such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani. But of all the statutes that include no express overt act requirement, have any of them been read to implicitly include one, which is the argument you're making that we should adopt here?\n That's correct. And no. There we have not found any cases where the Court has heretofore read an overt act requirement into a conspiracy provision. But this statute is unique. The money laundering statute is unique. If you look at the statute and we lay it out the statute in total in our reply brief, starting at 1a the structure of 1956 strongly supports our position that all Congress was doing, when they enacted 1956(h), was increasing the penalty for money laundering conspiracies. As this Court is well aware, when Congress typically writes a complex statute, the statute begins by setting forth all of the offense elements. Here, that would be set forth in (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). The statute then goes on in subsection (b) to set forth the civil penalty provisions. Subsection (c) then defines the various terms used in the act. Subsection (d) then talks about relationships with other laws. Subsection (e) identifies those Federal agencies that can investigate money laundering offenses. Subsection (f) talks about circumstances under which there would be extraterritorial jurisdiction. Subsection (g) then talks about recording reporting requirements, and then you get to subsection (h), which we say, when you read the statute as a whole, clearly intends simply that the penalty for money laundering conspiracies would be increased to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense provision.\n Except that there are other statutes that that read this way, which we have held to to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the penalty for it.\n Your Honor  \n I mean, it it could do that. Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense. And that could be deemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe the penalty for it.\n It could be construed as a freestanding offense provision  \n And there are other such provisions, aren't there?\n There are not any other offense conspiracy provisions that this Court has interpreted that had the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h).\n Well, Shabani comes pretty close, doesn't it?\n Shabani is a separate, distinct statute. 846 was a separate, distinct, discrete offense statute.\n like this it seems to me contains no express requirement of an overt act, and we've said, indeed, none is required and that at common law it wasn't required.\n That's true.\n So why would we read it in here?\n Because text as this Court has said on multiple occasions, in order to understand what the words mean in a statute, you have to look at context. So you have to look at where the provision is placed and what Congress meant by that provision and look at the statute as a whole. If anyone if we look  \n If you look at this statute as a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in it anywhere, do you?\n You don't find the overt act explicitly in the statute.\n And the fact that you described it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me cuts against you.\n No, because our position is that placing it in subsection (h) evidences that Congress' intent and sole focus when they enacted this was the purpose of increasing the penalty for money laundering. The  \n Let's get  \n And they were making it unnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in 18-371 or whatever it was.\n It's our position that they're incorporating the overt act requirement, the act in furtherance requirement, from 371 as evidenced by the legislative history.\n If that's so if that's so, then why does the venue provision which you were just alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph (2), a prosecution for an offense under this section. An offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought in and then it says (2) a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section. Not under section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section.\n And it would be an offense under this section because certainly the jury would need to find that the object of the conspiracy was money laundering. So it would be an offense in that respect.\n I I think that language really cuts very hard against you. A conspiracy offense under this section. It it is reading as though that's the section that defines the offense, not just the section that provides the penalty.\n I can see how you would read it that way, Your Honor, but the offense  \n Only because I'm a reasonable man. (Laughter.)\n The offense provisions set forth in 1956 are clearly set out and enumerated in subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). In 1988 when the statute was originally enacted, (a)(1) and (a)(2) set forth the offense provisions. When the statute was amended in 1988 and Congress intended to create another offense provision, they set forth (a)(1) the third sting provision which is (a)(1)(iii). If Congress intended to create an offense provision when they enacted 1956(h), they would have set it forth as (a)(1)(iv), or alternatively, they would have added or conspires to each of the predecessor offenses. Notably, the offense provision at issue here does not include attempts, which 846 did, and which the overwhelming majority of conspiracy subsections include attempts are included with offenses. The fact that Congress did not include attempts in this provision again reflects the fact that they were solely focused on 371, a conspiracy offense, and all they were trying to do was increase the penalty. The placement of the  \n Then you would expect at least a cross reference to 371 for defining the conspiracy, but there's nothing here.\n That's true, and it clearly would it certainly would be clearer had they done so. But if you take the language originally, this provision was proposed by Representative Annunzio to be an amendment to 371, and we lay out in our in the blue brief at page 12 what that amendment would have looked like, virtually identical language to 1956(h). Certainly if you read it in subsection 371 if you take the identical language and put it in section 371, there wouldn't be much of an argument, we would submit, that Congress surely intended to include the overt act, act in furtherance language and they were just talking about increasing the penalty for money laundering. That makes our point that you look at the language, and depending on where it's placed in a statute, it can have different meanings.\n You have given a few examples of a word may mean different things in different contexts, but you haven't given any example and I don't know that there is one where the entire string of words is identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies, and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the other. I mean, you have a much harder argument to make when you're talking about an entire provision where the wording is almost identical than when you're talking about one word used in different contexts.\n That's true, Your Honor, but as this Court said in Shabani, absent contrary indications, the Court will presume that Congress intends to incorporate the common law concept of the terms that it uses. In Shabani, the defendant did not argue any contrary indications. They argued that at common law conspiracy required the commission of an overt act. That is not our position. But our position is that here there are contrary indications, and because the statute is ambiguous based on the placement and structure of 1956(h), you have to look to see if there are other indications. And clearly in the legislative history  \n Yes, but there's nothing in the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?\n No, but that is not dispositive because the placement the Congress has said I mean, this Court has said on multiple occasions that you need to read a statute as a whole, and when you look at the  \n But if you read it as a whole, you can't find any ambiguity.\n I think you can find ambiguity, Your Honor.\n In the text of the statute?\n In the  \n Reading the whole text.\n Reading the whole text of the statute, it looks to me it reads that the offenses are set off set forth at the beginning, followed by the civil penalties, then procedural aspects, including this penalty provision for increasing conspiracies.\n None of which mentions an overt act.\n No, it doesn't mention an overt act, but  \n So I don't find anything ambiguous in what you describe.\n Well, we believe that 1956(h) clearly reflects Congress' intent to solely increase the penalty.\n Perhaps that's all they thought of, but maybe they did a little more than they thought they were doing.\n Well, if Congress inadvertently omitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior occasions read into congressional silence terms, definitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out. So in United States v. Taylor, for example, the question was whether or not Congress intended to revert back to the common law definition of burglary in the Career Criminals Amendment Act, and in 1984, the Career Criminals Amendment Act had language that talked about a generic burglary, breaking and entering into a dwelling. In 1986, when they amended the act, they removed that language. The question before the Court then came up what does you know, what does burglary mean. Congress had omitted those words, but the Court found that that wasn't Congress' intent. They clearly didn't intend to revert back to the common law, and it was probably an error of drafting and this Court found that generic burglary was the standard. So this Court has done that before. In the in the Perrin case, United States v. Perrin, the same thing. There words were missing from the statute and the Court did not find that in Perrin it was a bribery case, and what was at issue was whether or not the the statute covered bribery of private persons or only the common law definition where it would only incorporate bribery of public public persons, public officials. And the Court said even though there are other statutes that have private person language in it, similar to this case, even though there are other statutes that have overt act requirements in it, we are not going to assume that Congress intended to revert back to the common law and interpret bribery as only applying to public officials. So this Court can look at the legislative history. The purpose is clear. The Government admits that the purpose of the act was to increase the penalty. Prior to 1956(h), money laundering conspiracies were prosecuted pursuant to 371, which required the commission of an overt act. Congress clearly intended to increase the penalty from 5 years to a potential 10 or 20 years, based on what the object of the conspiracy was. The legislative history all reflects that fact, and the Government admits that. The as contrasted with 846, which in which the public law described 846 in a section labeled offenses and provision in the money laundering context, the public law described 1956(h) as a penalty to increase the as a money laundering conspiracy for increasing the penalty.\n Can I can I ask what you make of subsection (d) of of this provision which says that violations of this section may be investigated by such components of the Department of Justice as the Attorney General may direct and by such components of the Department of the Treasury as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to offenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction, by the Postal Service? Apparently there was some turf war going on as to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and and this was meant to to solve the turf war, but it reads violations of this section. Now, does that allocation of authority among Justice and Treasury and the Postal Service not apply to the conspiracy offenses under section 371? Because that's not a violation of this section.\n I'm not sure I understand your point. I would think that if it's a conspiracy to commit if the specified unlawful activity is one of the postal offenses or one of the customs offenses, both of which carry  \n The offense is never completed. there's nothing nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and you're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this section. This section sets forth the penalty that's your argument but it does not establish the offense. The offense is established by 371. If that's the case, this allocation of responsibility among the various divisions of the Government doesn't apply to conspiracy prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.\n It's our position that when Congress enacted this, they were trying to enact a penalty-enhancing statute. 1956(h) then incorporates or impliedly recognizes the overt act requirement from 371. Congress was not intending to change the way money laundering conspiracies were prosecuted. They would have done so under 371, requiring the act in furtherance, and a jury or a judge would find that money laundering was the object of the conspiracy. That's how Congress envisioned this act as as being applied, and so I would assume Congress would envision that if it was a conspiracy to violate one of the postal offenses, that the postal authority would have had authority to investigate that offense. Interesting  \n What do you excuse me. What what do you make of of this argument? Let's start with the premise that Congress wasn't thinking about overt acts at all. Start with the premise that you argue from that what Congress was concerned with here was primarily penalty. However, Congress did this in a context in which there are two recognized kinds of statutes, two recognized kinds of of conspiracy formulations. And if one has the magic words in it referring to an overt act, you got to prove an overt act. In the other variety, there's no reference to overt acts, and as a general rule, you don't have to prove overt acts. Why isn't it a sensible interpretive rule to say, look, when there are recognized models and Congress, in fact, chooses one rather than another, we're not going to get into the question of did Congress really mean to make a change when it picked one model rather than the other? It simply picked one model, and the the clearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law is to apply the model. If it didn't talk about overt act, there's no overt act requirement. Why isn't that a sensible way to to work our way through these thickets?\n I I think that would be a sensible way to work your way through thickets of statutes that were enacted after Shabani when this Court created that formulary.\n But Shabani rested on on the existence of these prior models. Shabani didn't create them.\n That's correct, but there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Nash and Singer, the cases that Shabani relied on, were ever discussed or contemplated by Congress. If Congress was going to make such a fundamental change in how they were going to prosecute money laundering conspiracies, they would have said so. We're not talking about a backdrop of not requiring an overt act and should Congress read an overt act into Congress' silence.\n There are about there are over 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act requirement. The the argument you're making, I suppose, would require this Court to go by one by one through those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests of every one because the absence of those words is not dispositive, as you see it. So you would be generating a controversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that just wouldn't be there if you agreed with Justice Souter's approach.\n Well, we don't we don't believe that's the case because if you look at all of those subsections in title 18, none of them have the structural ambiguity that 1956(h) has, combined with a venue provision  \n Have you looked at all 59, I think  \n The  \n and assured yourself on that?\n I've I've looked through the entire statute, and I have not found title 18. I have not found any that have both an anomaly, a structural anomaly, and a venue provision that turns on the existence of an overt act.\n Well, we've already dealt with venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a requirement.\n Well, first of all, we would submit, just briefly on on the venue point, if Congress wanted this to be a permissive venue provision, they could have said venue would lie where and in the circumstances or as otherwise required by statute, in which case they could have shown that they were applying to other statutory bases for venue, as well as what Congress was establishing here. They didn't do that. The venue provision was enacted in response to this Court's decision in Cabrales, which dealt with the money laundering the substantive offense of money laundering, and this Court's suggestion that money laundering could be considered a continuing violation for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 3237, the continuing offense venue provision. If all Congress was doing was codifying that principle and trying to address the issue in Cabrales, they would have just dealt with substantive money laundering in the venue provision. They would not have also included a provision in the venue section dealing with conspiracy. The fact that they did and the fact that they used language that this Court has previously found to  \n It gave it gave the prosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.\n We say those are the only choices on where to bring suit. But  \n Do you want to reserve any time?\n Oh, yes. I'm sorry.\n Mr. Marcus.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The money laundering conspiracy statute does not require proof of an overt act for three reasons. First, the text of the statute contains no such requirement. Second, the statute is modeled on the drug conspiracy statute which this Court unanimously held in the Shabani case does not require proof of an overt act. Third, the statute was enacted against the background rule of statutory construction that that a conspiracy provision, whose text conditions liability on the act of conspiring only, will be construed to follow the common law, where proof of an overt act was not required for conviction. This Court should adhere to its bright line rule in this case because it provides clear guidance to Congress and to the lower courts. Petitioners seek to avoid application of the bright line rule on a variety of grounds, none of which has none of which has merit. I will address a few of those grounds here. First, the money laundering conspiracy statute, section 1956(h), is not a penalty provision for the general conspiracy statute, section 371. Section 1956(h) does not contain any reference to section 371, and petitioners are unable to cite any provision in the United States Code that provides a penalty for an offense defined elsewhere, without also referencing where that offense is defined. Under petitioners' theory, if section 371 were repealed tomorrow, section 1956(h) would also no longer be valid. But there is  \n If if 371 were repealed, would it affect the actual practice in the Justice Department? I I think I recall reading in the briefs for the other side that that the the United States has continued to charge conspiracies in money laundering cases under 371. Is that correct?\n Well, my understanding is on on occasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case. Where there are several objects to the conspiracy sometimes for purpose of simplification, the Government will just will charge a 371  \n But not in exclusively laundering cases.\n Generally, no. There might be there might be an occasional example where it may have been an oversight where a prosecutor may have overlooked section 1956(h), maybe soon after 1956(h) was enacted, but generally speaking no. The money laundering conspiracy prosecutions were done under 1956(h).\n When when you say when there are multiple objects, you're not getting the money money laundering just under 371. You'd surely charge both under 371 and under under what is it? 1956.\n That's correct, Justice Scalia. You could. You could prosecute you could prosecute them as as separate offenses, but sometimes the Government for just for purpose of simplification will just charge one one agreement with multiple objects, and one of those objects might be a money laundering object.\n If it were just money laundering, could you charge under 371?\n Yes, you could charge under 371. There's nothing that prevents the Government from doing so. This Court has has held before, for example, in the Batchelder case that there can be multiple provisions that essentially cover the same conduct, and the Government has discretion to choose which one to use. Generally speaking, the money laundering conspiracy statute contains higher penalties. So the practice today is is to prosecute those offenses under section 1956(h). Another another reading there another reason they're reading that it's a penalty provision should be rejected is that Congress modeled section 1956(h) on the drug conspiracy statute that's virtually identically worded to section 1956(h), and no one disputes that the drug conspiracy statute establishes a freestanding criminal offense.\n This is 846.\n 846, yes, in title 21. Petitioners also argue that because prior to enactment of section 1956(h), the Government had to prosecute money laundering conspiracies for 6 years under section 371, that this Court should presume that Congress intended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of section 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense. But this Court looks, first, to the text of the statute to discern Congress' intent, and had Congress wanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement, it could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h) on the language from 371 or on the language from any of the other numerous conspiracy provisions in the code that contained express overt act requirements. Congress chose a different model, the drug conspiracy statute, which as I said before, this Court held in Shabani does not contain an overt act requirement. By choosing that model, Congress manifested its intent not to require proof of an overt act because at the time it because at the time it acted, the background rule of statutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute that conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring would be construed to follow the common law. Petitioners point to silence in the legislative history, but the silence in the legislative history on the overt act requirement is not the kind of compelling evidence of of contrary intent that would justify departing from the text of the statute and this Court's bright line rule. Finally, petitioners rely on a venue provision for money laundering cases, section 1956(i), which was enacted 9 years after the money laundering conspiracy statute at issue here. That venue provision reflects Congress' intent to identify a variety of districts in which money laundering cases can be brought. It does not reflect an intent to redefine the the elements of the substantive money laundering conspiracy offense.\n What do you make of the the argument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that the reference to any other district where an act in furtherance, et cetera, took place implies that in the clause preceding, they were referring to a district in which an act in furtherance took place?\n Justice Souter, I think what what that terminology was was referring to was district. The other is meant to modify district. In other words, the first the first clause there provides a venue where the case can be brought. And if it's not brought in that if it doesn't fall within that venue, then you can bring it in in a different district, an other district. I think that's the the best way to read the the statute. I mean, otherwise, it could have as it was pointed out during petitioners' argument, otherwise they could have just had one. They wouldn't need separate clauses. They could have just had one clause that said, and the case the conspiracy case can be brought in any district where an overt act was committed. Petitioners seize on the fact that the venue provision permits venue to be laid in any district in which an overt act was committed. But the rule in conspiracy cases has always been that an overt that venue can be laid where an overt act was committed regardless of whether an overt act was an element of the offense. At common law, as I said before, conspiracies a conspiracy conviction did not rely depend on proof of an overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common law where an overt act was committed. The common law venue rule has been applied consistently to modern Federal conspiracy statutes, such as the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not require proof of an overt act as an element of the offense. Congress' codification in the money laundering statute of of this of this venue principle cannot be read to presuppose an overt act element when the very venue rule it was codifying did not presuppose one. If this Court if this Court has no further questions  \n I had just one other question, just out of curiosity, about how important this case is. How many prosecutions under this statute does the Government bring without proving an overt act?\n I'm I'm not aware of I'm not aware of a number, Justice Stevens.\n Are there any?\n I I don't know. I mean, it's  \n It seems to me quite unlikely.\n Well  \n I'm just wondering. It seems to me sort of a tempest in a teapot, this whole case to me.\n Yes. I think it's true in the vast majority of cases, the Government does have proof of an overt act. And, of course, overt acts help establish the establish the agreement and and to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt there was an agreement. If the Court has no further questions  \n I I do have one and it's not on the money laundering conspiracy issue, but in this particular case, would it be consistent with the position that the Solicitor General has been taking for us to hold the final disposition of this case pending Booker and Fanfan? Wasn't there a sentencing question?\n Well, it's our position that it wasn't they didn't raise that issue in in the court of appeals. They didn't raise the Sixth Amendment issue in the court of appeals. They didn't raise that issue in their cert petition here, and so it's it's not covered by the by the question presented. So it is the position that we've that we've set out in the brief that it should not be it should not be held pending that that disposition in Booker and Fanfan.\n And that's consistent with the position that the Government has been taking routinely in cases where Booker where the sentencing guidelines are an issue?\n Well, I think in the I think that that position is based on petitions that have raised the question, I believe. If if the Court has no further questions, it should reaffirm the conspiracy statutes that do not contain an overt act requirement should not be read to include one. Thank you.\n Thank you, Mr. Marcus. Ms. Samek, you have about 3 and a half minutes left.\n Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Ginsburg, you had inquired about the number of subsection conspiracy subsections, and I didn't get a chance to answer your question. Even if you don't find the statute is unique because of the venue provision, as my review of the conspiracy subsections in title 18, there were only about two others out of the 50-some-odd cases that have the same structural anomaly that 1956(h) does. So this would not be opening up a can of worms to say that in this case an overt act clearly was intended by Congress and that we need to look at congressional intent. So it wouldn't be require a holding in this case consistent with congressional purpose would not require the Court to then have to review every single title 18 conspiracy subsection. As the Government pointed out, money laundering cases are not typically prosecuted without the commission of an overt act because overt acts are relatively simple to prove. There's no reason why Congress would have intentionally eliminated the overt act requirement from money laundering conspiracies when, on the one hand, it's easy to prove, but on the other hand, it placed such a critical value in money laundering conspiracies because it's not just that it shows that criminal intent has crystallized and that money laundering is actually afoot, but you're talking about taking offenses, like we say in our brief, where someone pledges a a cow for collateral for a loan and then they talk with a friend about whether or not they should sell the cow, and they decide not to sell the cow. Under the Government's theory, they couldn't be prosecuted for defrauding the Government because, in fact, they never sold the cow. They couldn't be prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud the Government because they didn't commit an overt act in furtherance of defrauding the Government. They couldn't be convicted or prosecuted for money laundering because they never sold the cow, so there were never any proceeds to generate. But they could be convicted, under the Government's theory, of conspiracy to commit money laundering based on the sale of a cow and their sentence would increase from a potential 5 years to a potential 20 years. There's absolutely no indication in the Congressional Record that Congress ever intended such dramatic triggering of substantially higher penalties without the commission of an overt act, which is not difficult to prove.\n The Government has said that that you have essentially waived their sentencing guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your brief to consider.\n In the district court, there were issues raised as to all defendants as far as various sentencing enhancements. In front of the Eleventh Circuit, one of those enhancements was argued and it was rejected. As to Mr. Hall, one of the sentencing enhancements were argued and was reversed on that sentencing enhancement. But there is still a sentencing enhancement that was raised in the Eleventh Circuit, but it was not raised in this petition. It was not the issue that this Court granted cert on, but we would argue that it's still a valid a valid claim and that this Court should hold this decision in abeyance until its decision in Booker and Fanfan.\n Was the argument below that   that imposing the sentencing enhancement was unconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts didn't support it?\n The argument was that the facts didn't support it. Finally, Your Honor, we would Your Honors, we would just again say that Congress did not intend to cause a dramatic change in the way money laundering conspiracies were prosecuted. This Court has said in other cases that when Congress intends dramatic changes, that you would expect to find something in the legislative history. The Court has said that in the Lewis case having to do with interstate gambling and I see my time is up. Thank you.\n Thank you very much. The case is submitted.\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The petitioners in this case are American citizens who took cruises to and from this country on tickets bought here that call for the application of U.S. law. They were subject to discrimination by respondent, a U.S.-based company on the land, in the ports, and in the waters of the United States. The question presented is whether the Americans With Disabilities Act applies or instead whether respondent's conduct is lawful because the case is controlled by Bahamian law, which freely permits cruise lines to discriminate against persons with disabilities.\n Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU area, have applied their own disability laws to some of the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?\n Justice O'Connor, our research does not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU. I can, however, provide you some information, and that is that two points I think. The first is they subscribe the members of the EU subscribe to the same conventions and to UNCLOS just the way we do, which gives the port state plenary authority within its ports and internal waters. And I have a couple of case citations for you on this issue. In the ECJ, the Diva Navigation case, 1992, ECR I-6019, and the Mateo Peralta case, 1994, ECR I-3453. It has not arisen in the EU, but it has arisen in Australia. Australia has a disability law. It applies that law to cruise ships, and the rule in Australia is that the port state law applies rather than the flag state law. And the citation for that is the Union Shipping case, 2002, NSWCA 124 CA 40379/01. I don't know what those numbers mean.\n Thank you. And would you also address at some point how the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea would affect the resolution here? For example, it has, as I understand it, requirements that there be watertight doors and those doors have to be set above the level of the floor so you couldn't roll a handicapped wheelchair or something over it. Now, do you anticipate that there would have to be structural changes if you were to prevail that would conflict with the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea?\n No, and you have put your finger on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts. We know that for a couple of reasons. The first is that there has been a detailed rulemaking underway in which the regulatory authorities charged by Congress with implementing the ADA have spent quite some time. They have produced this single-spaced, half-inch thick document that is dedicated to making  \n Are they in effect yet?\n They are not, but in terms of whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would conflict, you would look to this document and they took as their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such conflicts. What they did let me take your example specifically and then put place it within the statutory framework. Within the ADA and a question of the combings, what they said is, that's right. In certain cases SOLAS requires that the coamings be a certain height. If the coamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be worried about water coming in below, that is not an accessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it at all. Above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp down, unless that's structurally infeasible. So they what they did is they and this is the broader point. they applied the rule of the ADA that a change to the structure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's readily achievable. And what the regulatory authorities determined is that if there is any conflict with SOLAS at all, that change need not be made. Now, you Justice O'Connor, you also focused on the fact that there are some of our claims that implicate the structure of the ship. They are, however, a distinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this because I don't think the other side has any good argument at all, under international law or anything else, that would explain why they can charge a person with a disability double.\n Can you tell me just a little bit about that, how it works? Suppose that you prevail in this case and it does seem to me that the the charging the double doesn't involve modification of the ship, obviously. How does it work if you have, oh, say, an English passenger who buys an English ticket and is charged double I don't know if that's the English law, but let's assume then he comes on a cruise ship and he goes to New York and Miami and and New Orleans? Can he does he could he then sue, if if we rule for you in this case?\n I would think on the question of the charging double, the answer to that question would be no because it would present a traditional, not unique to the ADA, choice-of-law question, and that is, if you're in England and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is going to be subject to English common in that case, the English disability law. There is an English disability law. It doesn't discuss cruise ships. It's but it's broadly written. But with respect to the structure of the ship, I think that English passenger with a disability say that you come across to the United States and you want to get off in New York. I think that Congress clearly intended that that person would be able to come off a off the dock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the wheelchair; while you were in U.S. ports and you're staying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your accessible your accessible rest room, have grab bars. We are and and let me not pass too quickly by the fact that even when we talk about some structural changes in the ship, by and large we're talking about things that have nothing to do with Justice O'Connor, you focused the name of the treaty is the Safety of Life at Sea. Whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has nothing to do with that. Whether there is  \n Mr. Goldstein, may may I take it from your answer that it doesn't make any difference in your view, your answer to the question about the the ship leaving from a port in England and going many places and touching base in New York, that kind of a voyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast majority of the passengers are from the United States, the port of departure is in the United States, the port of return is in the United States. You don't seem to distinguish those cases because you say in the New York port, it doesn't matter if it's really a U.S.-centered cruise or a cruise centered in Italy or any place else. Is that correct?\n I think your formulation is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't matter to us where the cruise is centered. We do, however, and this Court's precedents do, however, leave room for a highly unusual cruise that I'm not aware exists. Take, for example, a situation in which a cruise comes from England to the United States. It doesn't pick up any passengers here. They just visit. They stop in 15 other countries. They stop here. The same passengers get up on the ship and leave. This Court's precedents involving maritime choice of law leave room for the conclusion that says, look, we just don't think  \n But if we go back to what is the more usual situation  \n Yes.\n Then you are, in effect, saying that the U.S. rules the world. Even if the home port, the place where this vessel is usually berthed, says we we don't require our ships to take care of the handicapped, you are, in effect, saying no matter what the other ports say, what the U.S. law is is going to govern because practically if you're going to design the ship to meet the U.S. requirements, you're not going to rip those out when the ship goes elsewhere.\n Justice Ginsburg, we disagree with the characterization that the U.S. rules the world, of course. We're talking about the fact that Congress exercised its sovereign authority to control vessels in its ports and internal waters, just as in take the Cunard example. In the Cunard case, there were countries and I understand it didn't involve the structure of the ship, but the principle is the same. There were countries that required alcoholic beverages to be on those vessels, and  \n We we could we could require ships that are docked in the United States to pay their crews according to United States Jones Act requirements or United States minimum wage laws and so forth. We don't do that. We could do it, but we don't because it conflicts with with the law of the flag and and that's the usual it's not a matter of our power to do it. We could do it, of course, but it's just not something we ordinarily do.\n Well, Justice Scalia, I actually disagree with your characterization and would like to point you to a couple of precedents. The Benz and McCulloch cases, which are very important to the respondents, were very important to the Fifth Circuit, embody the principle that you just described, to some extent, and that is that when you have a foreign ship in our waters, we will not apply the NLRA to the labor contract between the foreign crew and the foreign vessel. But when Americans are involved, we do apply the NLRA, and that's the Ariadne precedent that the and and in fact, Ariadne is the most on-point case because it  \n Was was that the ship or was it longshoremen?\n It was longshoremen working on the ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship.\n Longshoremen. Longshoremen based based on shore. Right?\n Based on shore, but so are the passengers.\n That's a different  \n But it is a different situation, but I think it's more analogous. Not only were the the protests in Ariadne directed at the safety conditions on the foreign-flagged vessel, but they were directed at the passengers. If I could  \n What's what's the scope of what you're talking about here? I mean, are it says cruise ships. So I had assumed those are those big ships that carry people mostly around the Mediterranean from Florida. But based on what you're saying, now I think you're talking about something more. Are you talking, for example, about a merchant vessel that comes from, say, Saudi Arabia and has a few passengers? What's the what's the scope of the definition?\n The well, that the definition we would have to return to the ADA. If a merchant ship has a few passengers, it would not be a specified form of public transportation or a public accommodation.\n Because? It what it does is it carries oil, but a certain number of people like to be on a ship with oil, I guess. And so every every month they take 12 people and they put them in a cabin somewhere and they love it.\n It's cheaper. It's cheaper too. (Laughter.)\n I'm not aware of of  \n No, no. I but all right. Now, I'm I'm being facetious.\n Yes.\n But I am aware of of people who have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily merchant ship. Now that that I think is a common thing.\n If let me  \n Are you talking because I think that makes a difference for the reason that once you talk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign-flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the United States where the costs would be very high probably to change the ship and the benefit to Americans would be tiny. All right. So I I want to know what you're talking about.\n Okay. Let me first say and just to to lock the point down in that cost is accounted for in the definition of what is readily achievable. But let's go to the definition of specified public transportation because this will tell us what's going to be covered by the ADA. And just for the transcript, the citation is this is section 12181(110). It's it's very short, but it's at the middle of page 12 of the blue brief. Specified public transportation means transportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance other than by aircraft, which has its own statute, that provides the general public with general or special service on a regular and continuing basis. That too would be covered. And only the public places on the ship would be covered by it. Can I just return briefly to my Ariadne point? Because I just wanted that's a case where the the NLRA was applied. And let me just read to you what the protest was that the NLRA was applied to because it fits perfectly with this case. And again, for the transcript, this is in the lower court opinion at 215 So.2d 53. This was the handbill. Warning. Is your cruise ship a floating death trap? Can a substandard foreign-flagged cruise ship turn your holiday into a Holocaust? They were very illiterate. If thousands of unsuspecting Americans continue to place their lives in jeopardy every day on cruises aboard foreign-flagged floating fire traps. And that that was a foreign-flagged ship. They we're concerned about the passengers. Justice Scalia, you also gave the example of the Jones Act, but remember that the Rhoditis case and the Uravic case, which involved injuries in the United States, then the Jones Act did apply. And that was and Rhoditis was a case in which someone was on the ship and a chain broke and they were injured as a result of it, and U.S. law applied. This is a situation in which millions of people in the United States are spending billions of dollars on cruises, and it seems  \n Yes, but I if I understand you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise ships. It's limited to ships that come into passenger ships, which would include the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, all the rest of them. Wouldn't it?\n Yes, but I I take it that the you know  \n And the fact that it's based in Miami or it had mostly American customers really is not relevant to the legal issue. Is it?\n It it is in the sense that it makes this the recurring scenario that Congress would have been aware of when it enacted the ADA in  \n But, of course, they would have been aware of those that are also less American in their patronage and so forth.\n That's true. In the very rare case, which I am not aware of, in which a cruise ship comes to the United States, doesn't pick up passengers, then it's possible that the that the ADA would not apply.\n No, but we're not necessarily thinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner that goes from Liverpool to Miami or something. That would be covered.\n It would in in U.S. territory. That's right.\n But there's no way they can change the ship structurally when it's in New York and not have it changed structurally when it's in Europe. So the mystery to me at this moment is what is the universe of ships that I would not say fit the ordinary word cruise. What they are are ships that go between Asia and San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York and Europe, or maybe through the Suez Canal. They're only here a little bit of the time. Their passengers are mostly not American. Now, is that something I should worry about? If that were your case, I would be very worried. If that's just a little bit of of added significance, then I want to know what to do about it.\n Let me tell you what I know, and that is that the other side has not identified any problems of this this type. My research has not revealed some situation where we have a lot of these ships. I did carefully study the the itineraries of the major cruise lines, and 95 percent-plus of all of their trips go out from the United States and come back to the United States.\n But you told me and I want to make sure this is your answer that it doesn't matter, that as long as the ship comes to a U.S. port as part of this overall journey, you you answered that question and I thought that was your candid answer, that it doesn't matter that these these particular cruise ships ply mostly U.S. waters and U.S. trade and are centered, even have their principal place of business in the United States. You're not concentrating on that category. You are saying that the ADA applies so long as the ship puts in at at a U.S. port, picks up passengers. It applies not only while it's in the port, but practically for every other place the ship goes. That's why I asked isn't this the United States rules the world on what your argument you made.\n Justice Ginsburg, here I think is the difference, and that is, that while U.S. law may have an extraterritorial consequence, just like our maritime tort law and the like, you cannot in Europe enforce the ADA. The fact that the structural changes  \n Well, you can enforce the the discrimination provisions, but the structural provisions don't have to be enforced. Once the step is changed, they're not going to change it when they get 3 miles out.\n That's right. But Justice Justice Ginsburg's point I take it to be a more particular one. It's true that our law will have consequences abroad, but it is not the case that the U.S. rules the world.\n Well, it rules the world unless the world does not want to use the United States ports as ports of call.\n Justice Justice Souter, I I simply disagree, and that is, when you talk about the U.S. ruling the world, in a in the context, say, of ARAMCO, we talked about the enforceability of U.S. law abroad. When the United States has tort standards or vehicle manufacturing standards and the like, all of those have consequences abroad for how devices are made and brought into the country. But that doesn't mean that what's going on is the plenary authority of the United States to enforce its laws in its ports and in its internal waters. That very rule always will have extraterritorial consequences.\n We're not questioning the authority. We're questioning whether Congress intended that to be the case. We have a rule that that requires a clear statement when it has effects of this sort.\n Justice Scalia, we disagree, and let me just take you to your cases. I did that, I think, in the Jones Act and the NLRA context. But let's just state the rule, and that is, from the Wildenhus's Case and that's at page 12. Foreign law governs matters of discipline and all things done on board which affected only the vessel and those belonging to her and did not involve the peace or dignity of the country or the tranquility of the port. And what we're talking  \n But, Mr. Goldstein, there's another aspect that troubles me. Your view, as I understand, only applies while the ship is in American waters so that if, for example, you complain about the training for a safety drill, if they conducted those after they'd gone out 20 miles to sea, there would be there would be no violation of the the statue. Would there?\n That is that is a difficult question. We have not we have not pleaded such a claim.\n In other words, I'm trying to understand. You don't know what your position is  \n No.\n with respect to what would otherwise be violations of the statute that occur on the high seas.\n We do believe it would be covered because the accommodation was purchased here, although we haven't raised the claim in this Court. If I could reserve the remainder  \n Yes, but I think we should the cruise ships are entitled to know whether they may freely discriminate against people in the casinos and so forth when they're on the high seas.\n We  \n You don't know the answer to that.\n Justice Stevens, our position is that because of the definition of commerce in the ADA, when you purchase a public accommodation in the United States, that is an agreement to provide a public accommodation and it doesn't  \n So your view is not limited to what happens in the territorial waters.\n That is right, although we have we would win the case on the internal waters and the territorial waters, and we haven't asserted in this Court a claim relating to the high seas. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.\n Mr. Salmons, may I ask before you begin whether the United States agrees that the statute would apply to the activities of these ships when they're on the high seas?\n Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: We do not think that title III of the ADA was intended to apply extraterritorially. That said, we think there is a question that would need to be resolved as to whether applying the ADA to a public accommodation that was entered into in the United States, that began in the United States, a necessary term of which we believe would be nondiscrimination, would in fact be an extraterritorial application of U.S. law.\n When when the ship is out on the high seas?\n That's correct, Justice Scalia.\n You think that's a hard question  \n No. We think the better view  \n whether that's an extraterritorial application of U.S. law?\n No. We think the better view, in fact, Justice Scalia, is that that would not be an extraterritorial application of U.S. law. But if the Court were to disagree, then we would say title III does not apply at that time.\n Do you  \n I don't know what extraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean that, that a ship that is not in the United States is bound by United States law. What why isn't that extraterritorial application?\n The reason, Justice Scalia, would be because the accommodation that was offered, that was entered into, and that began in the United States and and I would point out I think this is important to keep in mind  \n What you're saying is it would I thought you were saying that it would be the enforcement of the domestic contract of which the the statutory provisions would be an implied term. Isn't that it?\n Yes. Yes, that's correct.\n It does not apply of its own force. It applies because two parties in the United States contracted that it would apply. Is that it?\n That's correct. Now now, I I would just add that I think it you could characterize a public accommodation, you know, five nights lodging, for example. If that's entered into in the United States and and that begins in the United States, that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination, and  \n Well, then if you  \n if you have an ADA claim that governs that even if the discrimination occurred abroad, that would only relate to those things tied into the accommodation.\n But if you're on a round trip ticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend on where you bought the ticket.\n Well, again, we we think that if accommodation begins here in the United States, that that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination. Now, whether you characterize that as a contract claim or as a substantive application of the ADA, I'm not sure there's much of a difference.\n Yes, but Justice Stevens' question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool. Is the ADA an an American buys the ticket in Liverpool to come to the United States.\n To come to the United States.\n Is the ADA an applied term of that contract?\n I would I would assume not, although the question then would be whether or not it's a public accommodation that's been offered in the United States.\n Don't don't all  \n Even in U.S. waters? That wouldn't make sense. An American buys a ticket in in Liverpool. He's disabled. He goes to New York, Miami, New Orleans, and he's discriminated at at each step. No no coverage just because of where he bought the ticket?\n No, no, Justice Kennedy, that's not our position. Let me let me try and be clear. We think that any vessel that comes into the internal waters and ports of the United States and offers a public accommodation or a specified public transportation service to our residents is subject to the ADA.\n Do you  \n Well, that means  \n If if you had a situation I'm sorry.\n No, go ahead.\n If you had a situation where you had a ship that let's say, that began in in Great Britain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers here in the United States, I think that the better view would be, sure, United States law could apply to it because it's in our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter, with regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be a public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA because it's not an accommodation that's offered  \n But do you  \n or available to United States residents.\n Do you agree with Mr. Goldstein that nothing turns on one might characterize this kind of cruise as U.S.-centered, but his answer was as long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick up, they unload passengers, they take them back again on the ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port, letting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies? Do you agree with that interpretation?\n As I understand what Your Honor just said, I think that I would. Let me just clarify, though. We think the relevant question is whether that ship would has offered a public accommodation or a specified public transportation service  \n This is my  \n in the United States, and if the answer is yes  \n Let let me ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Goldstein. Even in the Cunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have liquor in the U.S. port, but when they leave and they go to Jamaica, they could pick up rum there. They could have liquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they enter and leave the U.S. port, they didn't have the liquor aboard. Here what you're saying is what goes in the for the New York port goes for every other place where this ship puts in.\n Well, again, I not as a matter of not as a matter of extraterritorial application of U.S. law, but that is our position with regard to a public accommodation that begins in the United States. I I think the the important  \n Suppose it doesn't begin in the United States in that it it starts in, say, The Bahamas, and stops at  \n I should probably should not have said begin, Your Honor. What I mean is if it if the public accommodation is provided for in the United States, that would be covered by the terms of the ADA, we think the ADA applies.\n Then you're saying exactly what everybody is worried about. I take it there is no way really for a ship to they either have the right door or they don't have the right door. And we're interested in the set of cases in which they're going to have to change their doors. And what I came in here thinking was we're talking about ships that pick up people and sail in Florida and sail around the Caribbean. That's the now, I've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those. We are talking about ships like I'm the last human being alive that went on a Swiss ship to Europe. Okay? (Laughter.)\n 50 years ago. And and we're talking about those ships, or we're talking about merchant ships that also say to the public, come as a passenger. Now, I would like to not what you're arguing. You're going to say, yes, we are arguing it. I want to know say something to relieve my concern about that set, which was Justice Ginsburg's concern. We are trying to rule the world in respect to those ships that only come here occasionally or it isn't a big part of their business, but they want to come to pick up American passengers.\n Sure. Sure. And what I would say with regard to that is that you're right that our broad view is that the ADA applies if that if they're offering public accommodation here in the United States. But if you reject that, I think there are several ways you could approach that. One would be to apply traditional choice-of-law factors that are that are applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you know, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient contacts here and whether or not  \n Well, you're saying that this is your position, but don't worry about it because we'll reject your position?\n No, no. He asked me to say something that that would would help his concerns. What I'm trying to say  \n One thing might be true, what you're not saying, is there really aren't very many of those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of those ships that there are are already subject to tougher tougher rules, say, in Europe. But you don't say either of those.\n No. No  \n Since you don't you say either of those, I think neither may be true.\n Well, I don't know the specific number. I would think that there are not many that the that this what you're concerned with primarily here are cruise ships that are in the business of providing public accommodations. But I would add as well and I think this is very important that the Court keep in mind that the clear statement rule, as it's as it's posited by respondent here, would not just apply to the ADA. It would apply to all U.S. laws, and that would include title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in its prohibition of racial discrimination, and I would find that that would be a remarkable construction.\n It depends on what what kind of laws you're talking about. Laws that require the crew to be treated differently are are quite different from law laws that that require a passenger to be treated a certain way in the United States.\n Justice Scalia, you're correct, and that's precisely why they have  \n And laws laws that require structural alteration of a ship are quite different from laws that say while you're in United States waters, you won't discriminate on the basis of race.\n If two two responses, if I may, Your Honor. And that is, if you if that is the conclusion you reach, then you still need to remand this case because there are an awful number of claims that are precisely those kinds of claims that the Fifth Circuit would not allow. Secondly, I think you're wrong with regard to the scope of the clear statement requirement. There is no requirement that you have to have a clear statement to apply a U.S. law to a foreign vessel. There is only a requirement that you need a clear statement if the conduct at issue would relate only to the internal matters of that vessel. And here you're dealing with public accommodation  \n If we haven't expressed it yet, we ought to express it then.\n Well, I disagree, Your Honor. And what I would point you to is is that the long every time this Court has spoken with regard to the clear statement requirement relating to foreign-flagged ships, it has referred to the internal order doctrine. And that is embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go back for centuries. The the treaty that was at issue in the Wildenhus's Case expressly said that if the if the conduct did not relate to members of the crew but to passengers or other members of the port state or otherwise affected the interests of the port state, that the port state law would apply. And that is the general rule. The international regime that governs this area by its terms provide minimum standards and leaves it available to port states and to flag states to add additional requirements. That would mean  \n Mr. Salmons, one of the alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear statement, but as a a response to the issue that was being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that it was intended to exercise the the fullest extent of the of the commerce power. And The The Bahamas respond to that by saying you could have said exactly or argued exactly the same thing in McCulloch. What is your response to that?\n Well, I I would disagree with that on on a couple of respects. The first is that the definition of commerce here is broader than it was and specifically refers to travel between the United States and foreign countries. The only other statute we're aware of that says that is title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition  \n Well, may I just ask you a a factual question? I didn't go back to the text to check this. Does the text of this statute say in these words basically we are exercising the fullest possible extent of the commerce power?\n Absolutely, Justice Souter. What what the text of the statute says  \n And it's not in McCulloch.\n That's correct. What the text of this statute says is that in fact, this is the definition of commerce that relates only to title III of ADA. And it says precisely that it includes travel between foreign countries and the United States and that Congress was intending to to reach the full sweep of its its constitutional authority.\n Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Frederick.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case is about congressional intent not congressional power. Congress undoubtedly has the power  \n Could you address the last point?\n Yes. It was not the fullest extent of the commerce power. That statute was at issue in this Court's case concerning the Lanham Act where the Court said that a violation of the Lanham Act that occurred in Mexico but had an effect in the United States was intended to be covered by Congress because that commerce clause, Justice Souter, did state to the fullest extent of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. This statute does not say that. This statute talks about commerce in and between States and territories, and it is much closer to the statute language that this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case where  \n So it it doesn't have the fullest extent language then.\n That's correct. That's correct.\n How does it compare to title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\n Well, there are slight differences in the language, but I don't think that's dispositive because title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case, the Court the Chief Justice's opinion there said that that language was not enough to express the intent.\n So that would be the same for title II, which is the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So I take it that you are saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the ADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would be inapplicable.\n It's all a question of congressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no indication of an intent that Congress needed to address any problem that arose with respect to that form of discrimination.\n So your but your answer is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in at a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its passengers on the basis of race.\n Well, there would be no U.S. congressional statute that would address that, Justice Ginsburg. There would be a violation of the Bahamian constitution which prohibits  \n I'm asking about the U.S. law and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in places of public accommodation.\n As I said, I'm not aware that there has ever been an instance of that in the cruise industry. Congress has not addressed that. We're talking about foreign ships here. And I want to get back to the structural features of the ship because the ADA fundamentally  \n Well, but this is a good question, and what is your position? That the ship could engage in racial discrimination while in U.S. ports on the selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations while in U.S. ports and within the 3  \n Justice O'Connor, our position is that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so there is no congressional statute that is on point.\n Then your answer, I take it, is yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because Congress has not told it not to. Is that it?\n No. No. Our position is that it can't discriminate because a different law proscribes that  \n So far as United States law is concerned, it could.\n Yes.\n And the same answer for 1981?\n Justice Ginsburg, as I said, Congress has not extended its laws to the full reach of U.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained that position ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago, The Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne.\n Well, let's put it this way. So my understanding of your answer is that we could write an opinion ruling for you but leaving these other questions open? I don't see how we can do that.\n What you say, Justice Kennedy, is that the clear statement canon requires Congress to say when it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel. Congress didn't do that.\n But if I'm writing the opinion and I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that I then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in the negative.\n You do, Justice Kennedy. And just as this Court in the ARAMCO case said that title VII doesn't apply to the foreign work in a foreign land by an American company of an American  \n But these  \n Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn't extended criminal laws of the United States to the full reach of U.S. power. It is only proscribed 15 offenses that will apply in the special maritime jurisdiction.\n Mr. Frederick, this is this is what concerns me about your answer. I know that Mr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter what kind of operation this is, but the operation that we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to what percentage of its passengers are from the USA?\n Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters in any given year.\n And does it normally start the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?\n The majority of them do.\n And how much of its advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?\n Justice Ginsburg, there all of those questions are going to be answered as a predominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the U.S. market.\n Well, this is the anomaly. You're asking us to buy an interpretation. An enterprise is U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to customers, passengers, and employment.\n And the reason, Justice Ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on vessels that go to other ports.\n Why don't you why don't you try to draw that line? Why don't you say that just as the applicability or not may depend upon whether you're dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're dealing with an American who happens to be injured on board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least in some of its applications requires structural changes or not? That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply, but would not compel you to say that title II doesn't apply.\n We are talking  \n You're not willing to take such a limited position.\n Well, Justice Scalia, I think the Court could certainly carve out in its clear articulation of the clear statement principle some of these lines. It becomes very  \n Well, the ADA itself makes an exception for things that aren't readily achievable. I mean, you could certainly lean on that because a structural change probably isn't readily achievable.\n Justice O'Connor, Congress, when it talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of cost. It didn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws of other nations or  \n Is there is there I mean, you're giving me the answer I thought the other side would give me. All right? And I appreciate it actually. (Laughter.)\n You say that two-thirds of these people, the customers, are American. So we're dealing with a business that is primarily American, not a business like the Swiss ship except with the exceptional cases. Then you say, all right, still it's a problem because of structural changes we'll have to make. What changes? That is to say, I would have thought I could have read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe also have discrimination laws against disabled people, and therefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr. Goldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your clients will have to make any significant structural change that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.\n That's  \n Now, what's the response to that?\n Well, that's completely false. In in the year 2000, the United States Government issued a report that contained an extensive appendix, which we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious detail the conflicts between land-based ADA standards and SOLAS. Now, I can give you some specifics, if you would that are fairly practical, such as the ADA requires under the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that there be a disabled access cabin on every level of the ship, but SOLAS requires that passengers with disabilities be placed near evacuation points.\n Why why can't you just fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably achievable? Because in order to avoid that problem, what you're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a a disabled person double the price  \n As a matter of fact  \n because they're a nuisance. And that's your position.\n Justice Kennedy, as a matter of fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination here. We're having to fight this on the basis of assuming the the allegations are true, but they are categorically false. And  \n But it doesn't matter what you want to do as a matter of good will. The question is what the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up to us, we govern. You're not governed by U.S. anti-discrimination law.\n Justice Ginsburg, what the other side wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in which a district judge becomes the special master of the cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that would require some modification to the ship  \n That happens to every employer under in the United States under the reasonably achievable standard.\n And that's why, Justice Kennedy, it's a question of congressional intent. The very same Congress debated extensively about whether to impose design requirements on foreign ships in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and it decided to buck the international system knowingly by imposing a design requirement that double hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil tankers.\n Mr. Frederick, that brings up a question I've been meaning to ask you. To what extent was this whole problem of the application of this statute to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative history of these statutes?\n Zero. There is not one word about vessel  \n All right. If if that's so and if you look at the earlier cases but all I could get out it is that those earlier cases the Court tries to do what it really would have thought Congress would have intended in the circumstances. And if that's so, why wouldn't Congress really have intended that a business that's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?\n Because it was encroaching on an area of foreign sovereignty. Foreign ships are governed by foreign laws.\n Does does Britain or does Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid you to charge this double price?\n I don't  \n Does European law I'd be surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?\n I I don't know the answer to European law on charging of an additional price, but I would point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures, do go to the structure of the vessel. And we're talking here fundamentally in the ADA about structural changes that they want to impose that go when ships travel, they can't dismantle those structural changes when they leave U.S. waters.\n Mr. may I ask this question to you? What about a an American-flagged ship? Does the statute apply or not?\n Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved that question.\n What is your view?\n Our view is that there are arguments that can be made that it does not because Congress didn't  \n What is your view? Not what arguments can be made. What is your view?\n Well, I think (Laughter.)\n No. I think our view is that it doesn't.\n It does not apply.\n It does not apply because Congress didn't express the intent.\n So really, we're not concerned with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. You're concerned with the fact it's a ship.\n The there's a difference and and there are about 1,000 U.S.-flagged ships that carry passengers, so that if Congress had given any thought to the question, it is reasonable to suppose it might have distinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. law directly governs and foreign ships that are governed by a different law. The fact  \n Do we need do we need a clear statement for United States ships? I thought your case rested on a clear statement requirement. Is there any clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?\n No, no, Justice Scalia.\n So why why isn't there a clear difference between the two?\n Because there aren't any words in the statute that go to ships. The best they can do is a catchall phrase at the end of bus, rail, and any other means of conveyance.\n Well, that's pretty good, isn't it?\n Well, it's not (Laughter.)\n If you don't require a clear statement, that's that's good enough, it seems to me.\n Well  \n Your your case hangs on the fact that, you know, when Congress wants to to rule the world and say all ships in the in the world that touch at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so clearly. It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity with respect to American ships.\n With respect to foreign ships, there is a clear statement rule and that clear statement rule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is governed by the law of the flag state where it is registered. That's been the rule for 200 years. And the other side's position  \n Well, is that limited, though, just to things that affect the internal order of the ship? Is that the context in which we've articulated that rule?\n Well, it's been articulated in several different contexts. In the Brown v. Duchesne case, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case where the Court said that a patented device on the ship, which was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an American patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law. And the Court said, because we can't conceive that Congress would have imagined this general language to encroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship. Now, the other side has exactly two sentences to say about that case, but that is the case that is directly on point because that case says that when you are dealing with American laws that are generally written, you would not ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless Congress said so specifically.\n But but in that case, there was as I understand it, there was no legal relationship of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing object and the ship in the United States. So it at least made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed to external relationships arguably involving or implicating American law. You've got exactly the opposite situation here. You've got contracts made in the United States with the foreign cruise line. You didn't have that in your patent case.\n Well, Justice Souter, you have a foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a foreign country under foreign engineering standards  \n With its principal place of business in the United States.\n For a time before that ship moves into another market.\n But  \n But its significant external its significant commercial relationships are in the United States with people in the United States performed partially in the United States.\n In just the same way that McCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course of business that is regular between Honduras and the United States is not going to be sufficient to apply  \n The crew members were Honduran in that case.\n They were.\n This if you just look at it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this operation. You'd say that's got USA written all over it. The passengers are from the USA. The company is centered in Florida. And then you have this flag of convenience that it flies which can legitimately govern the relationship with its crew. But to say that it governs the relationship with passengers, it seems to me very strange. And also the ticket says, passenger, if you're going to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and under U.S. law to boot.\n But a choice-of-law clause, Justice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be incorporated. I'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause that that simply takes in every domestic statute.\n Just it's just one other indicia that one looks at this operation and says this belongs to the USA. A practical judgment, I think, would come down there.\n And and you would have under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of other statutes of general application that are now going to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a lot of business in the United States. The problem here, as a matter of congressional intent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this, and because Congress  \n Well, we we do we do have the rule if it if it applies to the internal operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may well be governed by the law of the flag.\n And the internal operations of the ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how everything about the ship's design  \n That's a part of the case I'm not sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be fought out under the reasonably achievable  \n It doesn't Justice Kennedy, the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport with the language of of the statute. Congress didn't think in terms of as it did in the Oil Pollution Act, it said, if there's a conflict with international law, work it out. Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations and work out the conflict. It didn't put anything like that in this statute, which is a further indication that if Congress wants to extend this kind of disability protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so willingly. And the Government has had 13 years to come up with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. Most of the regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an application to a large passenger cruise ship. If Congress wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this Court need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic legislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has not expressed the intent to do that.\n Could you go back to Justice Breyer's question about the number of foreign ships? Once we get beyond cruise lines, does it would would the the application on your view cover the the dozen passengers who decide they want to take a trip on a on a cargo boat?\n Yes. I don't perceive a limiting principle to the other side's position. In fact, there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or two stops in the United States a year, and under their view, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well. If if Congress wants to enact these limits, it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex area and ships are different from land-based accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate people within 30 minutes. And so when we train people, we have  \n But doesn't it on the other on the other side of the coin, apart from the structural problem and I understand the arguments on both sides there. With respect to things like safety drills and access to gambling tables and all that, it seems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll just do that once we're on the high seas so there's no conflict with the statute when we're out there.\n As a matter of fact, Justice Stevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in a different way. We have special access and assistance squads that go to persons with physical challenges to get them off the vessel in an event of a a need for evacuation. That's a different procedure than most passengers, but it's it is one that is in place.\n Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Garre.\n Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Applying title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act to foreign-flagged vessels would invite precisely the sort of international discord, conflict, and confusion that Congress presumably seeks to avoid when it writes American laws.\n Do you agree with Mr. Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit discrimination.\n Justice Ginsburg, first let me make clear that the Bahamian Government does and all of its cruise vessels are governed by that prohibition.\n I'm asking about the application of U.S. law.\n We think that that question can be resolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested, which is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes to the internal affairs of the ship and there we would suggest that there is more central to the internal affairs of the ship than its construction and design. Under international law, article 94 of the Law of Law of the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has ratified and by the way, the United States has not, and that's an important principle for this Court to keep in mind foreign-flagged states may be bound by different international treaties than the United States. So simply trying to draw some conflict resolution device that would deal with treaties that the United States has entered into, international nations have not will not address that problem.\n So before you go on to that, I want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil Rights Act of '64. There's you say, well, that's easier to comply with. But that's not the principle under which you're operating.\n No. With respect, Justice Ginsburg, our principle is that when it comes to the matters that under international law have been traditionally governed by the flag state, then when Congress writes its laws, we presume that unless Congress clearly indicates an affirmative intention to address those matters, it did not intend to. When Congress wrote the ADA, not a word of the statute indicates that it considered the international repercussions of applying that law to foreign-flagged vessels. Not a word  \n What about the what about the full sweep argument? Let's sort of come full circle on that. You you say the full sweep argument is no good because the same thing could have been made in McCulloch. The response was there is a textual difference  \n What's what's the full sweep argument? I don't  \n Full sweep of the commerce power.\n Justice Souter, first of all, it's it the statute doesn't say full sweep. It says sweep, and that's in the findings of the ADA. It's reprinted on page 32 of petitioners' brief. And second of all, the definition of Congress, which doesn't contain that sweep language, is almost identical to the definition of commerce in McCulloch, which is on page 15, note 3 of that decision, and that definition, the United States argued in the McCulloch case, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to foreign-flagged vessels. It's important to understand the the potential international conflicts that extending the ADA to foreign-flagged vessels could create. There are more than 40 nations that have adopted anti-discrimination laws for the disabled. Three nations have have adopted laws for domestic vessels: Britain, Canada, and Australia. If a country like the United States extended its laws to foreign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations may well follow suit. And if you take a simple hypothetical example, the Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New York, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has adopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain different structural and design requirements than the draft guidelines that the United States have promulgated. There are different requirements for door widths. There are different requirements for sloping. There's different requirements for the watertight compartments. There are different requirements about whether vessels have to be have accessible cabins all throughout the ship.\n When you say different, you mean you cannot comply with both.\n Well  \n Is that what you mean? Or or are those just minimums and and the United States would would comply with those minimums?\n Justice Scalia, I think in some you could and in others you couldn't. And and that's an important important point.\n And incidentally just for the are this ship has these are regulations that help the disabled?\n Yes, Your yes, Your Honor. And and in many cases, it's not going to be clear which regulation is going to be more accommodating to the disabled and which is not.\n Could they work that out? That is, if two-thirds of our universe really is American-based, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking about conflicts in real conflicts that that affect, say, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas like antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities get together and they try to write memoranda that that work this out in a reasonable way. Could could the same thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?\n We don't think so, Justice Breyer.\n Because?\n We would take the same approach that this Court emphasized in in the McCulloch case, which is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak havoc for the question whether a significant regulation like the ADA would apply to a vessel. How would foreign vessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they have to undertake the extraordinary changes  \n The answer would be yes, you do. You do have to, and then if there's some other authority that wants to get involved in this, the two authorities would work it out.\n Justice Breyer, the way that those issues are worked out in the international shipping context is through the International Maritime Organization. This organization has been responsible for crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly. We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief. Those guidelines right now are are not binding guidelines, but they could well become binding guidelines. And when an organization like the IMO addresses this question, it resolves  \n That's perfect because then the Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding international rule, anything that conflicts with that will be viewed as not reasonably achievable. So all you have to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with American law, according to them.\n Well, we don't think the readily achievable language in the first case in any way contemplates conflicts with international law. This Court has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with international obligations or international laws, including customary international law, as you wrote for the Court last term in in the Empagran case. We presume that American legislatures give respect to the interests of sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign interests of other nations. And that's what extending the ADA to foreign-flagged ships would do. The Bahamian Government has a solemn responsibility under international law and under its own law to govern the construction and design of all flags of all ships that fly fly its flags. Article 10 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag states have responsibility for the construction and design of ships. Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions specifies that flag states have responsibility over administrative, technical, and labor matters, including construction and design matters. These are precisely the sorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has been responsible for. And in the Brown v. Duchesne case, this Court recognized that, a case that dealt with the application of patent laws to the construction and design of a foreign-flagged vessels. There are going to be conflicts within between international law and the requirements of the ADA, but first of all, there's going to be confusion. It's been more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we don't even have final regulations as to what rules apply. And in the meantime, foreign-flagged vessels are going to have to be reviewing the case law in the United States courts, determining on a vessel-by-vessel, design specification-by-design specification as to what standards apply. That's only going to create additional international discord and confusion. Petitioners proposed solution to this problem we think is telling. They urge this Court in their reply brief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to foreign-flagged ships and other nations begin to follow suit and you have a crazy made maze of different regulations applying to construction and design, then at that point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it to clean up the mess. With respect, we think they have it backwards. The purpose of the IMO and the international framework that exists for governing regulation of shipping is to establish a uniform set of rules in the first instance. The IMO has already begun to address the problem at issue in this case, accessibility for the disabled. They are available to address that in a multilateral fashion. And Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave no indication that it weighed any of the international repercussions of the action that petitioners urges the case petitioners urge the Court to take in this case. And we would urge this Court to return this matter to Congress. Congress is in the position to weigh the risk of international confusion, to weigh the potential for international discord and to address those matters as it sees sees fit. If there are no further questions.\n Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Goldstein, you have about 40 seconds.\n Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, our position is the one that can accommodate your concerns. Theirs cannot. Just like in Empagran, where this Court built in comity considerations, relying on cases like Lauritzen that involved foreign-flagged ships, it said, look, even if the text of the Sherman Act or the FTAIA could literally reach it, in these cases that we don't think Congress could have conceived of, we're not going to apply the statute. But here, we have a situation in which this company has 95 percent of its cruises going in and out from the United States. Millions of people, and billions of dollars in commerce are affected by this statute and Americans that Congress had to have in mind.\n Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. The case is submitted.\n"}
