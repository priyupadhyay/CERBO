argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6722 # FALSE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER #  # We'll hear argument now on number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. versus Lasting Impression, Inc. Mr. Machat?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6724 # FALSE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns whether or not a defendant in a trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements of the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of that affirmative defense. Now, here are four reasons why that should not be the case. In the first place, if that is the case it would render the defense useless, because if there is no likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark infringement? Second --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6725 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You agree with Judge Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6726 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. Secondly, what it does is, is it shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. There's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to prove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a defendant. And then, also there's no reason to prove the fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence of likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of a burden. You have to prove, first of all --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6727 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # In this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6728 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This was a motion for summary judgement.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6729 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And was there anything in the affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6730 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yeah, actually, the record does contain some references to confusion. The -- in this case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did have some people that actually were confused. And when that happens, you need to look at what is causing the confusion. And essentially --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6731 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6732 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, but that's shifting the issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of confusion. However, even if there -- what I'm saying is even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any resulting confusion.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6733 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, is it possible that showing consumer confusion could be considered by the court on the issue of what's the fair use? What's fair?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6734 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the thing is, a lot of times when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the confusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements are being met. The confusion does not go to the likelihood of confusion issue; rather, it goes to the individual elements of the fair-use --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6735 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, but I'm interested in Justice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only discretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly infringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith assessment? In other words, suppose that it were shown that the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion. Would that --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6736 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes -- well, that would show an absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the elements of the fair-use defense.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6737 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, so that if you know that there's going to be confusion, there is no good faith? You wouldn't go that far.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6738 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, I wouldn't go that far. It's a balancing Test and that's why it says "fairly and in good faith," and you have to look at how descriptive the word is, in particular. For instance, if you're using the word "best" -- as in "best buy" or "best foods" -- I mean, best is an extremely descriptive word. So you could go a lot further in claiming, "Hey, I have the best -- I have the best food," or, you know, "Come to my store. I have the best buy." And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one of the risks that --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6739 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, is it your position that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? Is that your position?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6740 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, I wouldn't go that far, because you also have to look at the objective use.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6741 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I would have thought that consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the issue of fairness. Some of the amici take that position, do they not?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6742 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think -- I was reading the amici brief last night. I think the issue of confusion, as the INTA brief points out, you have to look at whether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not the term is being used as a mark or not. The same evidence that shows confusion can be used to show a likelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the case, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the case of determining whether or not the elements of a fair use defense have been -- have been met.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6743 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # What did -- what did the district court do here? Did it grant summary judgement or deny summary judgement?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6744 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The -- well, the district court granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. It found that, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good faith. The Ninth Circuit --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6745 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But the district court -- the district court -- this way -- [Laughter.]
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6746 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- seemed to focus on the use of the word "micro color," just the word. It didn't bring up what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears where "micro color" is not simply a word, but it appears in a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the district court said you could use "micro color" as you had been using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized 1999 new brochure. So --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6747 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, that is correct. The district court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that use in 1999.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6748 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And it might not have been confusion just by using the word. But when you're using it in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6749 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, in the abstract case, it could be. I would argue, though, in this case it's not, because that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. And you -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very bottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup. So --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6750 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, that wouldn't relate to the question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate to the reason for which we took this case.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6751 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Correct.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6752 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I mean, maybe the district court misinterpreted or misapplied "fairly and in good faith" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I understand it, the only question we have before us is whether the "fairly and in good faith" provision is an exception even when there is confusion.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6753 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, I would agree.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6754 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6755 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, I think --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6756 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So as far as --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6757 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- I think we're both saying the same thing
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6758 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So as far as Justice O'Connor's question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, it's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to that?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6759 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, I agree.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6760 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No. So your answer to her question is, of course it could be relevant. Let the other side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't have to show that there is no confusion.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6761 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Absolutely.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6762 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's where we are, is that right?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6763 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's exactly --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6764 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Okay.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6765 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- where we are.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6766 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Could you give us a -- I'd be much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily envision a situation where there is confusion but, nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a clear example.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6767 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In my particular case? This --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6768 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No. I mean, make up one --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6769 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Okay.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6770 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- that's really clear.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6771 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Let's use the words "best buy." Best Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and somebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, "Mark's, he has the best buy." He wants to advertise on radio, "Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for the best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's," and he keeps using those words "best buy."
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6772 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I don't think there's any likelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6773 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6774 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- what if he just takes out an ad that says, "Best Buy," exclamation point? That would be closer.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6775 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Okay, in that case there would be confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using "best buy" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore, he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair use defense. Because a lot of times when confusion comes up, it comes up in the case that --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6776 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I didn't mean to make it that in my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type at the beginning of the piece, "Best Buy," exclamation point. That means it's a trademark?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6777 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it would be evidence that it is a trademark. You have to -- it depends how big the words "best buy" were in relation to the word "Mark's Electronics."
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6778 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, but if you had a -- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, "Great Sale," that surely is not a trademark, just because you have it in boldfaced print.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6779 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I agree, it's not necessarily a trademark. You have to look at the totality of the ad, and you have to look at what the person is trying to use to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the products, or, in this case, the store.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6780 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I suppose if you have a sign that says "Park `n Fly" and an arrow, with a capital "P" and a capital "F," then it's arguably being used as a trademark.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6781 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6782 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Whereas, if you say in a brochure, "Rent a car from us, and park and fly," then that's okay. Is that the distinction?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6783 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, but I'd go even further and say that the -- if you had a big sign that said "Park `n Fly," and it's next to an airport, that would not necessarily be a trademark. I mean, if it said, like, "Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly," I would say that's being a descriptive use. But some people may argue differently in that case.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6784 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # The Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on the trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive. So this opinion starts out by saying, "Yes, we know that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is obliged to show likelihood of confusion."
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6785 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They do it. But then on -- if you look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion, the Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle paragraph, "As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis only complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood of customer confusion analysis." And then they quote from Transgo, and they say -- explain that "anyone is free to use a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as such use does not result in consumer confusion as to the source of goods." In effect, what they're doing is, they're expanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive words. Essentially what they're saying is --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6786 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, they go further in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer to a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not available if likelihood of confusion has been shown.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6787 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, and that's -- that's where they're negating what they said in the beginning of their opinion.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6788 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # They do have one authority for that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think they're right about that.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6789 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6790 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But there is a treatise writer who does take the position that if there's confusion, there's no fair-use defense.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6791 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there are other treatise writers -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if -even if there is likelihood of confusion.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6792 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So does the -- what is it -- the unfair competition restatement?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6793 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, that takes a similar position, as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the same time. Again, you have to look at what's causing the confusion. And most often the problem is the confusion is being caused because the person with the words in question is using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion. If -- there's certain -- there's certain -- there's certain terms and words that Congress has said never get trademark protection. Descriptive words, of course, is one of them, in the sense that they can never get trademark protection in their primary descriptive sense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in their secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove secondary meaning.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6794 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But I thought we're dealing with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning would be assumed.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6795 # TRUE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. In the case of an incontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed; however, that still does not take away the burden of the holder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of confusion. And, second, the trademark protection attaches only to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the primary, descriptive meaning of the words in question. And one other quick example. The laws say you cannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag. Now, we have 12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on their ice cream. There will be confusion there. Someone will say, "I want the ice cream with the flag on it." But they all have a flag on it. That's another example where Congress said, "We will tolerate confusion." Sometimes we tolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so business owners are free to describe their goods to consumers. And, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6796 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Very well, Mr. Machat. Now, Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6798 # FALSE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of a case where there might be confusion, but there would still be a fair use. This Court's decision in William Warner versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that. You had Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold. And this Court held, as a matter of the common law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair, truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result. There are other cases cited in the briefs. Howe Scale is cited in our brief. The Canal Company versus Clark case. The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes its -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly, Justice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to your questions about, what does a fairness component of this test in the statute mean. There is not a general requirement that the -- say, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but the non-trademark holder acts fairly. That's not what Congress said. It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief -- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -- putting that aside, used fairly only to describe the product. That is not some sort of general equitable receptacle for fairness concerns. That focuses on what the defendant did and how they acted in describing. That's not a test of how the public reacted. How did the defendant behave? Which is exactly what William Warner, Canal Company, and Howe Scale also looked at. In common parlance, in a common dictionary meaning, when you talk about fairly describing something, that's not general equity. That is, is it a legitimate, reasonable, proper, objectively apt, and fair way to describe a product. One could reasonably --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6799 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, does -- does consumer -- if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6800 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Not by itself, no, Justice O'Connor. Congress told us what will defeat the defense, and that is a -- that is a conclusion that the term is being used as a mark. Consumer confusion might be, if you could explain that that demonstrates that it's being used as a mark. It might show that you're not objectively, reasonably, accurately describing your product. If I describe Twinkies as a sugary snack, that's a -- I can fairly describe Twinkies as a sugary snack. I can't fairly describe Twinkies as a healthy food.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6801 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Suppose, in the Coco-quinine case, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine without using the particular term, and then he decides, "you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm going to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do that just in order to get more customers away from the trademark-holder." Is that good faith?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6802 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, because there's nothing, in the marketplace, with wanting to increase your business and to do better and to use descriptive terms descriptively to do that. The good-faith --

MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I wouldn't begin to know whether other professions or occupations use the term "micro color." But my understanding, from the record, is that the color is obvious. That's -- it's different color inks. And the reason that they use the term "micro" -- and this is on page, I believe, 98 of the first volume of the joint appendix, is that the molecular size of these inks is very, very fine. It's going into the skin. It's micron-size. And so that's, I think, the -- as suggested by petitioner's client -- that that's the origin of the term "micro color." Now, "micro" is a common term that's -- common descriptive term in its own right. It appears in many contexts. Obviously, computers is one that we're all familiar with. Medical devices often will refer to "micro." But "micro color" --

I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me, if you think that side should win, that the words are being used in a descriptive sense.

They're going to have to do more work. But the downside, the tradeoff, is, as you said, Justice Scalia, that you do not get to take those terms out of usage. Trademark law protects usage, not words. And if the usage is descriptive, and it's fair, in the sense that it's reasonable, apt, and accurate, as this Court said in William Warner, Canal Company, Howe Scale, in the unfair-competition sense; and the Kellogg versus National Biscuit Company, the Shredded Wheat case, if it's apt and accurate, that's what "used fairly" means. And if its satisfies that objective test, and if it satisfies the subjective good-faith test, and it's not used as a mark, we will tolerate that confusion, because that --

MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- defenses that are available, but the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable. That's correct. The way you prove whether something is used as a mark -- there's, sort of, two ways of getting to that end. When something is used as a mark, that means it is signifying to the origin or source of those goods in the marketplace. It's not just describing it, it's telling you who is making it or who is putting it out on the market.

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6844 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there's -- there's going to be difficult questions of proof.

BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Defendant's - Petitioner's absolute defense is contrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of the fair-use defense of the Lanham Act. In response to Justice Scalia's question about this is the risk that someone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this defense does not apply only to descriptive terms. Under Petitioner's view, this defense would be available to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a mark. Indeed, our mark here is not --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6848 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # How can you use a fanciful term descriptively? I mean, I think that's the definition of an arbitrary or fanciful term, that it doesn't mean anything.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6849 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it may mean something in a different context, I think an example you could use would be the arbitrary trademark of "Apple" for computers. There could be advertising for Computer Electronics, Incorporated in the fall, when there's the back to school rush, using the term "Apple" in a descriptive sense: "Apples for Teachers," you know, the beginning of the year, "Come to our store." So, in reliance on that, you drive two hours because you're the school district director who needs to buy ten new computers to hook into the system. You get there, it turns out they're not Apple Computers.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6850 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, but do they use the apple as clearly a descriptive term with secondary meaning, that's what gives it protection. But if you have an arbitrary term, as Justice Scalia says, how could that be, how could the defense have any relevance to a fanciful or arbitrary term. And I thought the defense only was relevant when you -- everybody agrees you're talking about descriptive terms?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6851 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor, the Solicitor General does not take that position either, in their brief they recognize that this applies to all level of mark.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6852 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, but that, all we need to decide this case is to assume that it's descriptive.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6853 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive, or descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as was pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be found in the English language anywhere, it doesn't describe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests the small nature and the fine lines that are ultimately used when this is applied.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6854 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Let's assume that it was descriptive, would the Ninth Circuit test still apply? That you would have to show absence of confusion before you raised the good faith defense?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6855 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We don't believe that's what the Ninth Circuit test does, this was a summary judgment entered against us when we had introduced --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6856 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, would you agree, then, that in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non trademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the fair-use defense without having to show that there's no confusion?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6857 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, we believe it's the plaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden to show likelihood of confusion. The point is, under the district court's absolute rule, notwithstanding evidence in this case of actual confusion, indeed, summary judgment was entered against us because the district court took Petitioner's absolute view that there was no relevance whatsoever to likelihood of confusion to the determination of fair use, that's the rule in the Ninth Circuit overall, and that's what needs to be affirmed.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6858 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now, I'm confused. I thought the question you're supposed to answer, which is in the blue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of confusion. And I guess now you agree the answer to that question is "no."

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6859 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes.

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6861 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I believe the Petitioner came up with that formulation because they had taken on the burden because they were the movant on summary judgment. That's where that misnomer came from.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6862 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Did you object to the formulation of the question presented? Here's the question, "Does the classic fair-use defense to trademark infringement require the party asserting the defense to demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion?" That's the question. And you say, "no."
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6863 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We agree that the plaintiff, it's clear that under - in the Ninth Circuit - the Ninth Circuit pointed out that, Justice Ginsburg quoted before, made clear that the plaintiff does bear the burden of establishing likelihood of confusion.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6864 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now, suppose you establish it, maybe we can find some differences here, would you also agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show that the confusion, along with possibly other things are such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word, unfairness, or lack of good faith?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6865 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We believe that when Congress --

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6867 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor, we agree that when Congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms "used fairly" to refer to the common law, which included not only the common law of technical trademark, but the common law of unfair competition.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6868 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Good, so now we have something I can disagree with you about. Now, the question would be, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show there's some confusion, which normally there would be, or quite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome their defense that they put here?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6869 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, the time that those words were used, the common law, and we respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General's office on the reading of Warner, we'd urge the Court to read that. The reason the Court allowed the use of the term in that case is because they quite clearly said it did not have a secondary meaning. There is no trademark protection for descriptive words with secondary meaning, we are in complete agreement with that. We're dealing with the secondary meaning.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6870 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All right, so now, if we're going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get protection at all, because I was thinking "micro color," well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny, teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color. And when I think of "micro pigment," I think of a farm animal, I think -- I don't know what I think, it's confusing me. So, for an average person, the word "micro color," I thought, "Gee, that's very descriptive of just what it is, a teeny weenie bit of color."
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6871 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I would urge you to look at joint appendix pages 137 to 139 where it lists twenty other competitors that sell this very product, they have no cause to use that word. It is not used in the industry as a descriptive term, they're called "pigment," they're called "ink," they're not called "micro colors," that is my client's trademark.

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6874 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But, what about the word, is it -- am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the word, "micro pigmentation" is used in the trade as a synonym for permanent makeup?
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6875 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct, and oftentimes, trademarks are shortened versions of other terminology. The fact is it is suggestive because "micro colors" is the protected trademark here.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6876 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But there is a sense of color in which color is synonymous with pigment.

As I pointed out, it's contrary to the textual language used by the Congress in 1946. They meant "used fairly" to mean what the common law meant. The common law prohibited confusing uses of both technical trademarks and trade names. Moreover, Petitioner's interpretation is contrary to the clear focus of the Lanham Act, which is to prevent customer confusion. The whole point is so that you can walk into a store --

That incontestable mark was a conclusive evidence of the mark holder's exclusive right to use that mark on the same goods. Same mark, on the same goods that were set forth in the affidavit with the PTO. That was akin to early common law. At that point, the plaintiff could go into court with their incontestable mark, and it was conclusive evidence. So there had to be a safety valve for defendants to be able to say, "Okay, I know this is an incontestable mark, I know that, and I know I'm using it on the same goods, but notwithstanding, I can use it because I'm using it fairly, I'm not confusing consumers with this.

Because that suggests you're trying to pawn off your goods as another's. Are you using it as a mark? Or, are you using it, merely descriptively? I thought use as a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're not using it in good faith.

BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, that is one of the factors in likelihood of confusion, that you can take into account, that there can be non-trademark uses that are confusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full of examples of that. I would like to make one other response to Justice Scalia's point, if I could. Justice Scalia, to the extent that you hold that the fair-use defense no longer prohibits, all uses are likely to confuse as unfair, we would look to the suggestion made by the amici that there is a middle ground that likely to confusion, in any event, cannot be completely irrelevant to the used fairly determination, as Petitioner in the district court would have it. We discuss on page 15 of our brief, for example, the Restatement's position, which we would urge the Court to look to, which is akin to what the amici suggests.

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6924 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, that may be, but the issue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too far in the other direction and required too much. And all we have to determine is whether there is a per se obligation to prove non-confusion. If we do so, that doesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's position, it simply says that the Ninth Circuit went too far, isn't that correct?

For example, in the middle ground, to determine what used fairly is, in addition to likelihood of confusion, we would suggest that there are other factors that the Restatement puts forth. For example, whether there is commercial justification for the use. Did we point out, there is no commercial justification, there are twenty other competitors that don't use this terminology.

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6944 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, all the difference in the world, Your Honor. We maintain that that is a mark use. I mean, the district court rejected that as well, but that is one of the issues where you suggested that courts have resolved these on whether something is used as a mark or not, that is not an easy answer, and that is why it's always part and parcel of the likelihood of confusion. That's the purpose of the Lanham Act, to ensure that when you go into a store, you can buy the products you want. For example, in the health and safety area here, you may be willing to buy a product that costs more money because you know of the quality of them. At the same time, you want to be assured when you go in, because you don't want to buy the one that's recalled all the time, or that has ingredients that cause allergies for you, that's what the Lanham Act is to protect. And it encourages the economic efficiency of the market --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6945 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Your customers are pretty sophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably know this market pretty well.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6946 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's directly relevant to the likelihood of confusion, Your Honor. In fact, the typical way of proving that when it ultimately goes to trial is through consumer survey. And the law is clear that that survey would not be of the person on the street, it would be of the appropriate purchasers, who are more sophisticated clinicians and cosmetologists. But, Your Honor, even on that situation in this record, we have direct evidence of confusion. It's at joint appendix page 170, Your Honor, it's the declaration of Gloria Torres, where about 1998, 1999, she was one of the people who did sales, and she started getting calls from people wanting products, and it confused her because they weren't on my client's customer list, and also they were citing different prices. It didn't mean anything to her at the time, it turns out this was the confusion because they were actually seeing this new usage on the marketing brochure by KP Permanent.

BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # They do, Your Honor, that's absolutely right, color wheels, color -- and also in the micro pigmentation history, it's very important, because even though it's like tattooing, the purpose is absolutely the opposite, it's to hide the color. So mixing of the colors is a critical component of that industry. I want to make another point about the economic efficiency that is furthered by the trademark laws and not allowing likelihood of confusing uses, which is what Congress intended. By allowing purchasers to know that they're getting the product that they want, they're a lot, able to be more efficient in the market --

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6952 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I don't think there's anything -- the way that Petitioner passed the Lanham Act grossly overstates it. I mean, I would just submit the following list. The only thing that the Lanham -- the Lanham Act does not allow registration of generic brands, as we mentioned before. It allows cancellation of any mark if it becomes generic. It applies only to commercial uses, not usage in ordinary English language, only in connection with the mark. It can only have a valid trademark when it's actively being used, any mark can be canceled or abandoned after three years. It also, of course, only applies when there's likelihood of confusion. Also there is an expert agency that reviews and goes through a process in which there can be oppositions, objections, all of this could be brought up at that point. And also Congress directly addressed anticompetitive interests when it enacted the statute. It, in 1946, enacted B(7) as a defense for antitrust violations. It also reinforced the Justice Department, and the FTC maintains its enforcement authority, and it also had a particular provision that allowed the FTC to go in and cancel registration. I'd also point out --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6953 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # What would be a really expert agency, which you referred to as represented by the government here, and it takes the position quite different from yours.

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6959 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, no, what I -- the government's position is the same position that, in fact, it urged before Congress in 1946. The Court's opinion in Park 'n Fly makes this clear. They did not want descriptive terms at all protected, even with secondary meaning. And as the Park 'n Fly opinion makes clear, Congress rejected that and struck the balance this way and included all of these other safeguards, not allowing registration of generic marks, always prohibiting uses that are likely to confuse. We would also point out that that encourages economic efficiencies for businesses as well. By being able to benefit from the reputation of your mark, the business invests more. As soon as confusion is allowed, there is a free rider problem, and that competitor is free riding on that investment. And it's a disincentive for further investment and it undermines the quality of the goods, because the only way --
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6960 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Certainly the Restatement and the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on this.
argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6961 # TRUE # MS. BRINKMANN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We believe that the Restatement and the amici are very consistent in rejecting Petitioner's position and the district court's position that likelihood of confusion is completely irrelevant. We embrace that, I think that's a consistent position, and that would be the bottom line, I would urge, on this Court, because Petitioner's position in the district court wreaks havoc, truly, with the statutory framework that Congress set up and intended. We believe as a matter of strict statutory construction, that indeed it is now a vestigial provision, the fair-use defense, after the 1988 changes to the inconstestability provision. But if the Court is not going to hold that that fair-use defense prohibits uses that are likely to confuse, we would urge the Court to adopt the Restatement position, that the totality of the circumstances, likelihood of confusion is relevant, we think factors that it's confusing in relationship to a health and safety issue would be relevant, the investment by the mark holder could be relevant. And to the extent the competitor had a commercial justification for it, because it was a term that everyone needed to use, but "micro colors" is just not that kind of terminology as the record in this case demonstrates. If there are no further questions, Your Honor.

argument number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up # 03-409 # 6964 # FALSE # MR. MACHAT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you. I'd like to point out that Ms. Brinkmann's reference to the legislative history is incorrect, and I'd just like to refer the Court's attention to my reply brief, pages 14 to 17 where basically it shows that prior to 1988, courts were required to find a likelihood of confusion before finding for the plaintiff on a trademark case. I'd also like to point out that in this particular case, the trademark is not for the word "micro color," the trademark is for the logo mark, and here's some of the confusion. The Respondents were able to obtain a trademark registration for the logo itself, and the strength in the logo itself is not being copied, we're just using the descriptive words within the logo itself. And Congress always intended for descriptive words to be free for everybody to use in their primary descriptive sense, so long as the person, the subsequent user, is not using those descriptive words in the secondary meaning sense, and that's the distinction. The confusion is only an issue to determine whether or not the elements of the fair-use defense is being met, but that confusion should be distinguished from likelihood of confusion. Confusion is a factual determination, likelihood of confusion is a legal determination. So you can use whether or not there is actual confusion to determine whether or not the mark, sorry, the word is being used as a mark.

So I would maintain that "used fairly" means truthful, or can determine whether or not it's exactly true, reasonably accurate. And that would be the meaning of "used fairly." And of course, good faith refers to the intent, and there you have the elements of the fair-use defense. Also, I'd just like to point out once again the Ninth Circuit opinion, it says on the bottom of page 17a, it says, "KP can only benefit from the fair-use defense if there is no likelihood of confusion between KP's use of the term `micro color', and Lasting's mark."

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6975 # FALSE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Though bound by Stanford v. Kentucky, the Missouri Supreme Court rejected both its holding and its rationale. This Court should stay the course it set in Stanford, leaving in the hands of legislators a determination as to the precise minimum age for capital punishment within the realm of Thompson v. Oklahoma, and leaving to jurors responsibility for determining the culpability of individual defendants above that minimum age. The Missouri court justified its departure from Stanford on Atkins v. Virginia, but the result it reached is quite different from the result in Stanford. In that -- excuse me -- in Atkins. In that case, the Court was addressing mental ability, itself a component of culpability. The Court announced a principle based on that characteristic, that is, that the mentally retarded are not to be eligible for capital punishment, but then it left to the States the determination of the standard and the means of implementing that principle. The Missouri Supreme Court, by contrast, jumped beyond the question of maturity, which is an element of culpability analysis, to the arbitrary distinction of age. It drew a line based purely on age, which is necessarily over-inclusive, and then it gave that line constitutional status, thus depriving legislators and juries of the ability to evaluate the maturity of 17-year-old defenders.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6976 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, we didn't leave it up to the States entirely. I mean, you -- you mean the States could adopt any definition of mental retardation they want?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6977 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. The States certainly --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6978 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So there's -- there's some minimal level of mental retardation. Right?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6979 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There is some minimal level.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6980 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And isn't that necessarily over-inclusive, just as picking any single age is necessarily over-inclusive?

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6982 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Surely there will be some people who -- who, although they have that level of mental retardation, with regard to the particular crime in question, are deserving of the death penalty.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6983 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I don't agree that it would be over-inclusive, given the Court's analysis in Atkins. The Court said that someone who has that level of mental retardation is simply not sufficiently culpable by definition. That certainly would not be true here. There are 17-year-olds who are equally culpable with those who are 18, 20, 25, or some other age.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6984 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But the age 18 is set even for such things as buying tobacco. The -- the dividing line between people who are members of the community, the adult community, is pervasively 18, to vote, to sit on juries, to serve in the military. Why should it be that someone is death-eligible under the age of 18 but not eligible to be an adult member of the community?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6985 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that legislators would be surprised, when they adopted those statutes, that they were affecting their criminal law. In fact, many of those statutes have individualized determinations, the military being one of them. 17-year-olds can enlist. There is an individualized determination, albeit by parents, not the Government. 17-year-olds may be serving in Iraq today. That -- the other kinds of examples that you cite, for example, tobacco --

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6988 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So their parents -- the same thing with marriage. A 17-year-old can marry but not without parental consent.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6989 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Although in most instances can marry if they go to a court and demonstrate they are sufficiently mature, again contemplating individualized determination, which the Missouri Supreme Court says does not exist as to 17-year-olds with regard to capital punishment.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6990 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why pick -- why pick on the death penalty? I mean, if you're going to say that somehow people under 18 are juveniles for all purposes, why -- why just pick on the death penalty? Why -- why not say they're immune from any criminal penalty?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6991 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I -- I must assume that if we -- if the Court says they are immune from the -- from capital punishment that someone will come and say they also must be immune from, for example, life without parole.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6993 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. The -- the problem with adopting the -- the 18-year-old line is that it is essentially arbitrary. It's the kind of line that legislators and not courts adopt.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6994 # TRUE # CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But didn't -- didn't we adopt a 16-year-old line in our earlier case?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6995 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In -- in Thompson, the Court in a 4-1-4 decision struck a 15-year-old -- a 15-year-old execution, and the States have taken, including Missouri through its General Assembly, have taken that to mean that there is a 16-year-old line. And today, in fact, I think it's true that there is a consensus nationally with regard to the 16-year-old line, not because it has some biological or psychological magic, but because perhaps --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6996 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, but -- but there was -- it's about the same consensus that existed in the retardation case.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6997 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Absolutely, that's true. If you look at the -- the --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6998 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And -- and so are we somehow required to at least look at that? I mean, the statistics of how many States have approved 18 years as the line is about the same as those in the retardation case.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 6999 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The -- the Court has kind of three groups of cases with regard to the number of States. On one extreme, are Enmund and Coker where you have three and eight States. On the other extreme, are Penry and Stanford where you have 24 and 34 States. And then there's this middle group, which isn't just Atkins and this case. It's also Tison, which is also almost exactly the same number. The Court in Atkins had to find a way of distinguishing Tison, to the extent the Court relied on that -- that counting process, and the -- the Court concluded that there was kind of an inexorable trend with regard to the mentally retarded. We don't have that kind of trend here. In --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7000 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, we -- we have a different kind of trend. What do you make -- you spoke of a consensus, but what do you make of the fact that over the last, I guess, 10- or 12-year period, the actual imposition of the death penalty for -- for those whose crimes were -- were under 18 has -- has steadily been dropping. I think 10 years ago, there were 13. Last year, I -- I think the figures were that there were two. The -- the consensus seems to be eroding, and yet as -- as the counsel on the other side pointed out, this has been occurring at a time when -- when treating juvenile crime seriously has not, in fact, been eroding at all. What -- what are we supposed to make of that?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7001 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, two things. Number one is that capital sentences have been dropping for all ages, not just for those under 18. So it -- you have to take that into account. The second is that although the last --

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7006 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I don't think we've seen that, or maybe we have seen that, for -- for death imposition generally. Is that so?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7007 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It is certainly greater, but part of the problem is we're dealing with such small numbers for the -- the juveniles, those under 18, that the difference of one or two makes a huge difference in how the numbers come out. But if you look over the last 10 years, in fact, it has gone up and down and currently is in a down trend, but the down trend --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7008 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, it went up once I think, didn't it?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7009 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It -- it went up once within -- since -- since Stanford and then came back down. Now, whether this -- this period in which it comes back down is going to remain that way or whether we'll go back up to where we were 10 years ago I don't know. That's entirely hypothetical to suggest that -- that this very recent trend is more dispositive than the trends over the last 10 years.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7010 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So -- so you're basically --

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7014 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, and the time is too short on the legislative side as well. We're only talking about the States that have adopted new legislation having done so, one of them in 1999 and the others simply in 2002 and 2004.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7018 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Since -- since Stanford, we have had no executions under 16 even though it is possible to read Justice O'Connor's opinion in that case as allowing a State to adopt a statute that specifically says 15. No one has tried that. Everyone seems to have taken Thompson and Stanford together to mean there is a 16-year-old line. Two States have adopted 16 by statute.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7019 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And -- and so you say there's -- there's not so much as a consensus as an understanding of what that decision means.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7020 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I think that that's right. There are States that have adopted it specifically and others have simply implemented it. If I were a prosecutor today, I -- it's hard to imagine that I would -- even in a State where I could find a statute saying I could prosecute someone under age 16, that I would try such a thing.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7021 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Let -- let me ask you this. I -- I don't yet have the -- the record showing the full closing argument of -- of both sides, but we do have the portion where the prosecutor says, isn't this scary? Can adolescence ever be anything but mitigating?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7022 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I don't know how it could be anything but mitigating. But what we have in that --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7023 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But that's not how the prosecution presented it to the jury.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7025 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # He said -- he -- he almost made it aggravating. Isn't that scary? I don't have the -- I don't have the full argument.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7026 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. What -- what he's facing is -- is 18 pages of transcript that occupied the -- the defense counsel's argument. Of those 18 pages, 4 pages are dedicated purely to Mr. Simmons' youth, and throughout the rest of the argument, he uses terms to reinforce that. He refers to him repeatedly as a 17-year-old. He calls him a kid. He does things to reinforce with the jury that he's very young. So then we come back and in a few pages of rebuttal, we have a couple of words -- I shouldn't say that -- two sentences in which the prosecutor is trying to respond to that particular lengthy theme and argument.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7027 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It was pretty clear. The -- the words in question were: Think about age. 17 years old. Isn't that scary? Doesn't that scare you? Mitigating? Quite the contrary I submit. Quite the contrary.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7028 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And if we were here because Mr. Simmons said that was improper and the Missouri Supreme Court said that was improper, well, we wouldn't be here.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7029 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But the question is, can -- is -- is age, youth inevitably mitigating, and here is a prosecutor giving the answer no, it can be aggravating.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7030 # TRUE # MR.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7074 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The -- Missouri, in order to implement the principle that those who are immature should not be subject to capital punishment, has adopted an approach that, first off, excludes anyone age 16 and under from capital punishment; second, requires certification by the juvenile court for anyone who is 16, but otherwise turns the matter over to the jury and defines it as a statutory mitigator. The kind of evidence that is discussed in Mr. Simmons' brief at some length could have been applied -- could have been presented during the penalty phase of Mr. Simmons' trial. It has been reflected in decisions of this Court as far back as Eddings where there was evidence of mental and emotional development. In Penry, there was evidence of mental age and social maturity. And here, in the post-conviction proceeding, Mr. Simmons presented such evidence regarding his impulsivity, his susceptibility to peer pressure, and his immaturity. But he didn't present that at trial. There is a mechanism in Missouri for him to do that and he chose not to.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7081 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So the reason that I thought arguably it's more relevant to look at the convictions is there are a lot of States. Say, New Hampshire, I think, for example -- when I was in the First Circuit, there were several States that on the books permitted the death penalty, but nobody ever had ever been executed. And -- and that's true across the country. There are a number of States like that. So if we look at the States that actually execute people, it's 10 years, say, 11 percent of the population are in such States. You go back 15 years, and you get these three other States, which raises the percentage. How -- how should I understand that? I'm interested in both sides --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7082 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Frankly, we don't know what those numbers mean because we don't know to what extent juveniles are committing capital level murders. We -- and there is no way in current social science to make that determination. It's interesting that among the three States -- two of the three States that are on that list that Justice Breyer mentioned are States in which there is a specific instruction to the jury, or indeed, in Texas, a requirement, that the jury evaluate future dangerousness. That is, the argument that was referred to by opposing -- or that counsel made, the State's counsel made, the prosecutor made, in the -- in the trial here, there's actually an instruction in some of those States. And that may play into the manner in which this -- those States -- the reason those States have additional convictions and additional executions. But Missouri doesn't have that. We don't require that the jury find future dangerousness, and although that may come up in the course of a mitigation and aggravation argument in the penalty phase, it isn't highlighted like it is in those States. And that may be more problematic than the system that Missouri has created. If the kind of evidence, psychosocial evidence, that is cited in Mr. Simmons' brief had been presented at the penalty phase, of course there would have been an opportunity to rebut it, to question it. Instead, what we have in this case is the marshaling of untested evidence from various cause groups and some dispassionate observers.

Legislatures can evaluate this series of studies and then pick what is essentially an arbitrary age. There is no study in anything that Mr. Simmons cites that -- that justifies that particular day, 18. They talk about adolescence. They talk about young adolescence, old adolescence. They talk about adolescence continuing until the mid-20's. Nothing justifies the age of 18. That makes it the kind of fact that a legislature ought to be evaluating, not a court.

The question here is where our society's evolving standards of decency now draw that line. 15 years ago, this Court found insufficient evidence to justify a bright line at 18, but since Stanford, a consensus has evolved and new scientific evidence has emerged, and these developments change the constitutional calculus for much the same reasons the Court found compelling in Atkins.

Every country in the world, including China and Nigeria and Saudi Arabia and the -- and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, every one has agreed formally and legislatively to renounce this punishment, and the only country besides the United States that has not is Somalia, which as this Court was reminded yesterday, has no organized government.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7121 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Of course not, but this is a -- this is a standard which -- a constitutional test that looks to evolving standards of moral decency that go to human dignity. And in that regard, it is -- it is notable that we are literally alone in the world even though 110 countries in the world permit capital punishment for one purpose -- for one crime or another, and yet every one -- every one formally renounces it for juvenile offenders. And, Justice Kennedy, my submission isn't that that that's set -- you know, game, set, and match. It's just relevant, and I think it is relevant in terms of the existence of a consensus. There was reference made by my opponent to the fact that there are four States that set the age at 17 and four States that set the age at 16. No -- in terms of movement, no one has suggested that any of those States or any other State has ever lowered the age. In fact, if you look at those particular -- those eight States, a number of them legislated an age that represented raising the number over what had previously been permitted. The movement, as this Court addressed, talked about in Atkins, has all been in one direction, and it's not as if that movement, in and of itself, answers the question. But where you have the type of consensus that exists here, as it did in Atkins, and where you have a scientific community that in Stanford was absent -- the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the major medical and scientific associations, were not able in 1989, based on the evidence, to come to this Court and say there is scientific, empirical validation for requiring that the line be set at 18.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7122 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, in fact, the American Psychological Association is not your brief. You're not accountable for inconsistencies there. But I -- I would like your comment. They came to us in Hodgson v. Minnesota, as I think the State quite correctly points out, and said that with reference to the age for determining whether the child could have an abortion without parental consent, that adults -- that they -- that they were risk -- that they could assess risk, that they had rational capacity, and they completely flip-flop in this case.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7125 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, no, no. I don't -- I think it's -- it may be in small part to that, Justice Kennedy, but I think the main point is that what their brief looked to -- what the argument was was our -- are adolescents cognitively different than adults. And the answer is, as we -- our brief concedes, is generally no. And what was at issue in the abortion cases was competency to decide. And just as we allow the mentally retarded the ability to decide whether or not to obtain an abortion but not to be subject to a penalty that is reserved for the tiny fraction of murderers that are so depraved that we call them the worst of the worst, here competency to decide here, as with the mentally retarded, isn't the issue. Christopher Simmons was found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed this offense with the specific intent necessary to do it, just as the mentally retarded can be. The issue in Hodgson was cognitive ability to be able to make a competent decision. And so I don't -- I didn't represent the APA then and I don't now, but I don't, with respect, think there's an inconsistency. In fact, the difference here goes to the factors that Atkins identified about why overwhelmingly the mentally retarded -- and here adolescents -- are less morally capable. They are much, much less likely to be sufficiently mature to be among the worst of the worst. And here, even more than with the mentally retarded, the few 16- and 17-year-olds who might, if we could even determine it, be -- we could determine were in fact so depraved that they were among the worst of the worst, there is no way reliably to identify them and there's no way reliably to exclude them. And it is in this respect that science I think changes. At the time of Stanford, everybody on this Court, of course, knew what all of us as adults intuitively know, which is that adolescents -- and -- and here we're talking about -- I agree that when adolescence starts and when it ends is undefined. But every scientific and medical journal and study acknowledges that 16- and 17-year-olds are the heartland. No one excludes them. And what we know from the science essentially explains and validates the consensus that society has already developed.

Robinson and Drope v. Illinois -- the jury is evaluating somebody, determining their moral blameworthiness 2 years later.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7159 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, no. What I'm -- what I'm asking you to do -- what I'm suggesting is that the weight of scientific and medical evidence of which the Court can take judicial notice and should take judicial notice and did take judicial notice in cases like Atkins and Thompson and Stanford explains and validates the consensus that society has drawn. We're not arguing that the science or what a particular neurobiologist or developmental psychologist says dictates the line of 18. The question is we have a consensus. It's even more robust than it was in Atkins. Looking at proportionality and reliability with respect to that consensus, is there a good, objective, scientific reason to credit the line that society has drawn? And I'm suggesting two things. Number one, that although one could posit that there are 16- and 17-year-olds whose antisocial traits are characterological rather than transient, we know it is impossible -- we know this from common sense and it's been validated by science, of which the Court can take note, that it is impossible to know whether the crime that was committed by a 16- or 17 year-old is a reflection of his true, enduring character or whether it's a manifestation of traits that are exhibited during adolescence. And --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7160 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, suppose -- suppose I -- I were not convinced about your scientific evidence was conclusive and I don't identify a clear consensus. Do you lose the case, or can you then make the same argument you just made appealing to some other more fundamental principle that Stanford was just wrong?
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7161 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Here -- no. Well -- no. Here's what I would appeal to. I -- there are three relevant factors that this Court has to look at. There's the determination of consensus. Is there enough of a one or isn't there? There's the determination of proportionality, and then there's the issue identified in Lockett and in Atkins, which is how reliable is the individualized sentencing process. How reliably -- when we're talking about picking the tiny few who are the worst of the worst, how reliably can we do that? We think that with respect to each of those, we have demonstrated that the Eighth Amendment requires recognizing 18. But I will take as a posit your hypothetical question that I haven't convinced you on number one, number two, or perhaps individually on all three. This is truly a case, Justice Kennedy, in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Taken together, the fact that it's impossible for a jury to know whether the crime of an adolescent was really the feature of an enduring character, since we know, as in Atkins, that many of the characteristics that manifest themselves in mental retardation also affect the inability of adolescents to communicate with their attorneys, to express remorse, that 2 years later when this person is on trial, physically, emotionally it's not the same person that the jury is looking at and being asked to evaluate --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7162 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So that -- that's -- that last point was what I thought the scientific evidence was getting at, that it simply confirmed what common sense suggests, that when you execute a person 15 or sometimes 20 years later, a problem always is that that person isn't the same person who committed the trial in a meaningful sense. And it's specially true of 16- and 17 year-olds who, observation would suggest, have a lot of changing to do because their personality is not fully formed. Now, I thought that the -- the scientific evidence simply corroborated something that every parent already knows, and if it's more than that, I would like to know what more.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7163 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it's -- I think it's -- it's more than that in a couple of respects. It -- it explains, corroborates, and validates what we sort of intuitively know, not just as parents but in adults that -- that -- who live in a world filled with adolescents. And -- and the very fact that science -- and I'm not just talking about social science here, but the important neurobiological science that has now shown that these adolescents are -- their character is not hard-wired. It's why, for example -- here's a -- here's an interesting and relevant scientific fact. Psychiatrists under the DSM, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, which is their Bible, are precluded from making a diagnosis of antisocial personality before the age of 18 precisely because before the age of 18, personality and character are not fixed even with respect to --

But accepting the premise of your question, my point is that science has confirmed what we intuitively know, which is that when the jury gets around to evaluating what the character was that manifested that horrible crime, they can't tell because of the passage of age and because of a number of confounding factors and because psychologists and psychiatrists can't tell themselves whether the crime that occurred 2 years ago or 2 weeks ago was the manifestation of an enduring character or transient psychosocial traits that rage in adolescence.

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7169 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Only part, Mr. Chief Justice. Part of it is that the jury, of course, is looking at the defendant, and we have laid before the Court peer-reviewed scientific studies that show that they -- that people are -- frequently equate maturity and psychosocial development with race and with physical appearance. In addition, because the adolescent personality is transient and the lapse of time for trial is 2 years, in a very real sense psychosocially as opposed to -- in addition to physically, the person that the jury is judging is not the -- is not a manifestation of the person who committed the crime.

One is that overwhelmingly as a group the mentally retarded are unlikely to be among the very worst of the worst, and the very deficits that they have -- that you called deficits in reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, makes the jury -- the process of the jury evaluating the moral culpability, the moral blameworthiness unreliable. And it's on the basis of those two things that we think that the consensus that's otherwise reflected is validated. And here --

A number of juveniles run in gangs and a number of the gang members are over 18.

First of all, if they are enlisted by people over the age of 18 to do that, the -- the precise degree of culpability goes to the people who are over 18, and juries ought to consider whether people who are over the age of 18 have so enlisted them. But even -- but with respect to --

WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think -- I think, as with the mentally retarded, or in fact, even more than with the mentally retarded, adolescents -- the -- the role of deterrence has even less to say, precisely because they weigh risks differently and they don't see the future and they are impulsive and they're subject to peer pressure. And in fact, if you look at what happened in this case, it's as good an example as any. The State says, well, okay, you know, he -- you know, this guy, according to the State's witness, the person, who was over 18 and described as the Fagin of this group of juveniles, testified to the court, well, Christopher Simmons says, let's do it because, quote, we can get away with it.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7178 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, there were a number -- a number of cases in the Alabama amicus brief, which is chilling reading -- and I wish that all the people that sign on to the amicus briefs had at least read that before they sign on to them -- indicates that often the 17-year-old is the ringleader.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7179 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the 17-year-old may be the ringleader, and even if you posit that Christopher Simmons was the ringleader here, he -- he wasn't under any illusions. He wasn't making a statement about being executed. He said, we could get away with it, which speaks volumes about the -- the extent to which -- this guy was subject to life without parole, which is, Justice Scalia, fundamentally different than death. This Court has said that only when the penalty is death, do you look at the character of the defendant as opposed to the nature of the crime and the act. But the data shows -- and I think this Court has acknowledged -- it acknowledged in Thompson in any event -- that the -- that adolescents like the -- the mentally retarded are much less likely to be deterred by the prospect of an uncertain, even if probable, very substantial penalty. The -- no mature adult would have thought, as Chris Simmons reportedly said, I can get away with this because I'm 17 years old, when the mandatory punishment for him would have been life in prison. It's -- it is not -- eliminating the death penalty as an option, which is -- which is imposed so rarely as to be more freakish than the death penalty was in Furman -- three States in the last 10 years, one --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7180 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But of course, the death penalty was not a deterrent for any of the crimes described in the Alabama brief because those are all -- crimes all occurred in States which execute people under 18.

But if you look at those examples, the very first one, this is a kid who went on a killing spree, including his father, because he felt he was unjustly deprived use of the family truck. And there -- I can go through the other examples, but these are posited as people who a jury could, with a degree of reliability that the Constitution requires, say acted out of a stable, enduring character rather than transient aspects of youth?

argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7198 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # From all that I have read, the evidence both directions is inconclusive, Your Honor, and thus, subject to legislators' determination. Mr. Simmons' counsel comes to the edge of asking the Court to elevate proportionality to be equivalent to -- to a consensus. But let me just highlight two aspects of the non-capital case proportionality jurisprudence of this Court. Justice Kennedy, in -- in Harmelin recently cited by the plurality in Ewing, pointed out that two of the considerations in proportionality review in those instances are the primacy of the legislature and the nature of the Federal system. What we should have here is a principle that is a principle dealing with immaturity, and the States, within the Federal system, should be able to make the determination as to how to implement it. As pointed out, this Court's jurisprudence in Eighth Amendment areas has proven to be a one-way ratchet, and because of that, the Court has to be very wary of leading rather than reflecting societal norms. Now, there are some States, of course, that have raised the age, the minimum age, for capital punishment, but at least in some instances, such as Missouri, that is a reaction to this Court's jurisprudence, that is, a reaction to Thompson and Stanford. Other States have left 18 for other purposes, and yet there still is a role by this Court. Pornography is an example. I am confident that but for this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, the Missouri General Assembly would adopt a statute that said that pornography should not be allowed at ages much higher than 18 and not because of maturity, but because of their opposition to pornography. In many of the instances cited by Mr. Simmons, the kind of statutes that he cites, gambling and others, it is a compromise in the legislative arena, not necessarily based on maturity or immaturity, that leads to the selection of the age of 18. Many States have, of course, individualized determinations with regard to those statutes. There was a discussion of driver's licenses. In Missouri, of course, we allow people to drive at age 15. They have to have parental consent, yes, but there also is a test. That is, there is an individualized determination before we do that, and that's what the State requests here. Mr. Simmons' counsel points out that in Atkins the Court took judicial notice of psychosocial evidence, and that's true. The Court did. But remember that what the Court had before it in Atkins was not a proxy for a -- a factor that plays into culpability. It was, in fact, the factor itself, that is mental capacity. And what they want here is not a determination as to the maturity or the capacity of individuals. They want a bright line test that is based purely on age. This Court should adopt, as it did in Atkins, a principle and leave it to the States to act. That's what the Court did in --
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7199 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Of course, one -- one of the objections in -- in Atkins was we needed a bright line test. We'd have difficulty determining which ones are mentally retarded. Here we don't have that problem at all. I guess everybody knows whether or not the defendant is over or under 18.
argument No. 03-633, Donald Roper v. Christopher Simmons # 03-633 # 7200 # TRUE # MR. LAYTON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, if that's the bright line. We don't know whether they're mature or immature, and we have to measure that somehow.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7219 # FALSE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents the issue of whether the California Department of Corrections, unlike every other State in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, may continue its more than 28-year, unexamined practice of routine, blanket racial segregation of its prisoners. The unitary practice in question here was applied more than 350,000 times last year, not just to the 40,000 new prisoners entering the California system, but to all 72,000 returning parolees and hundreds of thousands of transfer prisoners such as the petitioner in this case, Garrison Johnson, a petitioner who had been housed for more than 15 years in the California prison system. This unexamined, routine practice effectively erected whites only, blacks only, Hispanics only signs over the portals of the California prison system, and it is a practice which is routed in racial stereotype and the belief that all persons of a race think alike and act alike. California's needless and dangerous policy fails both the strict scrutiny test, which the Ninth Circuit should have applied, and the Turner deference standard, which the Ninth Circuit wrongly applied.

I take it that includes some people that are being transferred?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7223 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, correct, Your Honor. In -- in the circumstances in this case, Petitioner Johnson, for example, during his 15 years, had been transferred on five separate occasions, and the circumstances which he experienced are not unusual within the California prison system. Indeed, an outside-the-record fact: within the last three weeks, he's been informed that he's to be transferred yet again within the California prison system to another facility called Corcoran.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7224 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # May -- may I put aside for a moment the question of the strength of your argument in transfer situations and simply go to the circumstances of the original receipt of the prisoner for the first time into the prison system? What do the other States -- you say California is the only one that -- that makes this racial assignment like this. What do the other States do to guard against an -- an explosive team-up in -- in double-celled prisoners when -- when they're taking them in for the first time?

Other States use a random assignment circumstance, and giving no consideration whatever to race. And a third group of States apparently consider race as part of an overall or holistic bit of analysis with regard to trying to equalize the prison populations.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7227 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the best empirical evidence which exists that we're familiar with was reported in the Trulson study, which the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit petition for rehearing en banc relied upon and which the amici have filed with this Court. And in that circumstance, it suggests, over a 10-year study in Texas, that only five percent of all of the interracial -- of -- of all of the incidents of violence in -- in the Texas prison system were what was described by Professor Trulson as having racial motivations. And of that five percent, only one-quarter, or about 1.2 percent, were interracial circumstances where there had been interracial cellmates involved in the racial violence. And that seems to be, as far as anyone has been able to produce in this case in any part of the record, the best empirical data which might respond to your question, Justice Scalia.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7229 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Ginsburg, one of the interesting things about the record in this case is that the State of California has been unable to identify a single incident of a -- of interracial violence between cellmates. The record is bereft of that kind of information. Rather, they've spoken of information about violence which occurs in more --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7230 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, they say that that proves that their policy is very effective. I mean, that's -- (Laughter.)
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7231 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think the -- I think the record suggests, as at least in the testimony of Mr. Johnson, that it is a de facto segregation system which exists after the 60-day period and outside the transfer 60-day period, and so it would be hard for the State of California to provide -- to provide that data.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7233 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Kennedy, it seems to me that under the Court's strict scrutiny analysis, which in my judgment should have applied here, and under the particularized circumstance test announced in the Lee case in the concurrence, that a circumstance involving a single prisoner in a single prison cell on one occasion ought not to give rise to a systematic change in -- in a policy which is rooted in racial stereotype. With regard to those prisoners involved in that particular circumstance, of course, some period of -- of segregation would be appropriate as a means of controlling and ensuring that there's not going to be some kind of wholesale racial violence. That --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7234 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What is -- what is sacrosanct about the -- about the constitutional right not to be subjected to racial stereotype? There are a lot of other constitutional rights that people in prison give up. That's one of the consequences of committing a crime and being sent to prison, the most fundamental constitutional right, the right to -- to walk around and -- and not be seized. Why -- why is it that this -- this one constitutional right cannot yield to what prison authorities believe is -- is a useful, not necessarily essential, but a useful means of -- of maintaining order in prison?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7235 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Scalia, the fundamental teachings on the Fourteenth Amendment of this Court demonstrate that race is different, that the government use of race is presumed to be unlawful --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7236 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Oh, it's -- it's different from First Amendment rights? Prisoners can't hold news conferences. I mean, there are all sorts of very important constitutional rights that I think are no more important than the Equal Protection Clause which prisoners yield when they're in prison. Now, do we subject the taking away of all of these rights to strict scrutiny when the prison authorities do it? I don't think so. I think we say if it's -- if it's the judgment of the -- of the prison authorities, we -- we generally defer to it.

DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There's no doubt -- Justice Scalia, there's no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, but this policy of California is directed not to the gang aspect of it but to the race aspect. The record is clear that there's a near zero percent chance that any black person could be housed with any white person, that any white person could be housed with any Hispanic person, without reference to the gang question. And this is a transfer policy which recurs and recurs, five times in the case of -- of --

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7255 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We would -- we would be pleased to -- to prevail under -- under Turner, Justice Stevens. It seems that consistent with the Court's teachings under the Fourteenth Amendment and the most recent considerations by the Court of equal protection and strict scrutiny, that the use of race by California in this context should trigger a strict scrutiny analysis, should lead to an analysis of whether there has been narrow tailoring. But under the Turner test, we believe properly applied, the petitioner should prevail as well. Under the Turner test, it seems that at least two of the four elements which are announced in Turner couldn't possibly be met here. The first one is it seems to be no -- there is no reasonable relationship between the government regulation which is at issue and the announced policy. The notion that one can determine by race alone a violent propensity seems irrational, unreasonable, and contrary to the only empirical evidence which exists, the Trulson study.

It is -- it is undoubtedly true, taking the example of the Crips and the Bloods, that they are intra-racial threats, and indeed prison policy directed towards separating Crips and Bloods because of the -- of the intraracial problem is certainly one which would be something that the -- the prison system should address.

And -- and does it take any more than common sense to know that if you put a tattooed member of one group in with a tattooed member of the other group, the likelihood of violence in that cell is going to be greater? And is any more than that needed for -- for the -- for the prison not to cell them together? Would you acknowledge that at least if the -- not just on the basis that one is white and one is black, but if the prison knows that -- that one is a member of the Aryan Brotherhood and the other is a member of the Bloods, the prison can refuse to -- to assign them to the same cell?

Now -- now suppose -- I didn't mean to intrude on Justice Breyer, but just following this question, suppose that 50 percent of all the inmate population in a particular small prison is a member of one of these gangs. Then could you segregate on account of race?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7273 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think on race alone, the prison system would run afoul of the Constitution in making that determination. If it -- if race were analyzed in the context of gang membership, as part of an overall analysis of proclivity to violence based upon a series of facts existing in that prison, particularized circumstances, as suggested in the Lee case, I think that would be a proper analysis and constitutional.

I understand the -- your position that Turner is enough to cover this, but you're going-in position was that race is different, even different than the First Amendment.

Well, in this Court's opinion in the McKune case under a Fifth Amendment analysis, it was found that that didn't -- it was not analyzed under a Turner standard.

CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents the Court with an opportunity to reaffirm that all government policies based on race are subject to strict scrutiny. The deference generally owed to the sound judgment of prison officials does not require this Court to modify its repeated statements that all government action based on race should be subject to strict scrutiny.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7290 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Absolutely, Justice Stevens. I think if the Turner analysis is correctly applied in this case, this policy does not even survive Turner analysis. I would suggest it's very analogous to the marriage policy that the Court struck down in Turner applying the Turner analysis because there the State identified a concern with inmate marriages and particularly with inmate-to-inmate marriages, and yet they adopted a policy that prohibited all inmate marriages. Here there's a concern that's expressed with newly arriving inmates, about whom California says it knows very little. Yet, it applies its policies to transferring inmates, as well as to returning parolees.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7294 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- holding of this Court, and I think either under Turner or under strict scrutiny, it's still equally a constitutional holding. And I think it would send an improper message to suggest that there's some element of government decision-making that is somehow exempt from strict scrutiny. I think in a variety of contexts, this Court, where it generally reviews a government action deferentially -- take, for example, jury selection, peremptory challenges. Take, for example, military policy. Take, for example, congressional districting. Those are all government policies this Court generally refuse -- reviews under a highly deferential standard. Yet, nonetheless, when it comes to government policies based on race, this Court applies strict scrutiny. And in that sense, I think the racial districting cases provide a very good example because there, generally, as the Vieth case from last term illustrates, this Court is very reluctant to do any review of the districting lines that are drawn. Yet, when race is identified as being the cause for the lines being drawn, as in Miller against Johnson, this Court emphasizes that strict scrutiny applies.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7295 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is -- is there an argument to be made that the reason we make that emphasis and -- and an argument for you in this case that there is somehow a greater fragility to -- to the effective standards to prevent racial classification than there is to the possibility of enforcing speech rights and so on?

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7296 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think that's part of it, Justice Souter. I think one thing is that particularly because of the history of this country and the use of -- of race by governments, including in prisons, there is a concern that all government uses of race must be subjected to very heightened scrutiny.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7297 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes, but there's a pretty frightening history about speech restriction too.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7298 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, again, I think, though, that there is almost a uniquely pernicious history involving race in this country, and I think, again, it is completely wrong to suggest that somehow prisons were exempt from that history.

I mean, I think if you look at Brown against Board of Education itself and you look at the various per curiam opinions that this Court issued in the wake of Brown v.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7308 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What does seven -- what does seven to 15 days have to do with anything? It was for the whole stay that they were segregated. The stay may have been short, but the fact that during their entire period they were segregated showed that there was no other purpose to this thing except to keep the races separate. Whereas, here, they are kept separate for -- for the time which the California prison believes it needs in order to assure that there won't be violence, and once that assurance is given, the races are -- are mixed. That's a totally different situation.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7309 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # With respect, Justice Scalia, I disagree. The entire time these prisoners are kept at the reception center, which is a separate part of the facility where the incoming inmates go, that entire time they are segregated on the basis of race. Now, the Bureau of Prisons, for example, has a similar entry section in its various prisons. It's called the admissions and orientations process, and there, using the presentence reports that are provided for by California law, the Federal officials evaluate prisoners and their risk levels and have no need to segregate those prisoners on the basis of race.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7310 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # One of -- one of California's response said, well, the Feds have mostly income tax evaders, maybe some drug dealers, but the State prisoners are the real tough guys, the real violent criminals. So --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7311 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # They have a high class of felons in the Federal prison basically.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7312 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # With respect, Your Honors, that misdescribes the -- the population of the Federal prisons. Part of where I think they get off on the wrong step is they do their analysis only on the offense of conviction. But a lot of the individuals in the Federal prisons are, say, for example, convicted felons who are convicted for felony in possession. And the underlying felony that led them to be, say, a 924(c) defendant was a violent felony. And so we -- there are also agreements by which the Bureau of Prisoners, on request from States, will house the State's most violent criminals. So I think that's an unfair description of what the Bureau of Prisons policy -- or population looks like. And I think the fact that the Bureau of Prisons and virtually every other State that's looked at this issue has found a mechanism to deal with the problem of incoming inmates without resorting to race is a powerful indication that this kind of use of race is unnecessary. And the problem with applying Turner, rather than strict scrutiny, I think is well illustrated by this case and this policy. This is a policy that is expressly acknowledged to take race into account, and it is nowhere written down. If you pull the Department of Correction manual for the California prison system, there's a 94-page chapter on the classification of inmates. Yet, this policy doesn't appear there. It's an unwritten policy. Justice Ginsburg, you asked, well, was this policy introduced in response to specific incidents of violence in a cell. The answer to that is unknowable because nobody even knows how long this policy has been in place. The official responsible for administering it acknowledged it's been in place for 25 years.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7316 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it wouldn't survive a proper analysis under Turner. That is correct. But the -- the court of appeals here, applying its version of Turner, upheld this policy. And I think one way of looking at the choice between Turner and strict scrutiny is whether there is a greater threat that frequent judicial approvals of prisons' use of race will have the effect of diluting the strict scrutiny rigor or whether frequent disapprovals of prisons' use of race will have the effect of undermining the Turner deference. And the concern of the Federal Government is exactly that, that by having race policies evaluated under Turner, there will be a necessary temptation to bump up the Turner analysis in a way that strikes down racial policies.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7317 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You're concerned about evaluating prison race policies. Are there any other prison policies in the country that adopt a racial test like that?

CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think -- I think California -- it's -- it's best described as California is one of at most a couple of States that have a comparable cell-based policy of segregation. And so I think it really is kind of the outlier in terms of that analysis. Now, there may be situations -- and we think strict scrutiny can account for them -- where States want to take race into account in particularized circumstances. And I think testing those under strict scrutiny is the proper mode of analysis.

It's -- it has to do with the Trulson study, and the Trulson study indicated that the intake diagnostic centers of Texas were not required to be integrated.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7362 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All right. If we -- if we exclude Texas and California, on your recording, we've still got 80 percent of the -- the prison population in the United States, and apparently neither the Federal prisons nor any State does -- apart from Texas, has this policy.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7363 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, actually there's another State, Oklahoma, which has a very similar policy that says that --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7364 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. We've still got 47 States left. How -- how do you explain the fact that -- and -- and some of them don't have your racial problems. There's no question about it. I come from one that does not. But some do. And -- and how do you explain the fact that there is no sort of confirmatory record of what happens when you don't follow your policy?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7365 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think the answer is that they don't have the same problems that California has. California has the most prison gangs, the -- they are race-based. It's an extraordinarily difficult situation. And even the Bureau of Prisons takes race into account when it balances its prisons and that's in the United States' brief.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7366 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # May I go back to Texas? Because one of the pieces of information that was featured by the other side was this study in Texas that showed a decline in interracial violence when there was an increase in racial integration. So that empirical study showed just the opposite, that when you integrate, you get less violence than when you separate.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7367 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor. The Trulson study, however, only looked at inmates after they had left the reception center, only looked at inmates in -- in the integrated settings of the prison, equivalent to the areas that California integrates. So we don't dispute that once you have enough individualized information about an inmate, then you can house them according to an individualized information.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7368 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # On the individualized, there was something that I didn't grasp. You say we don't know anything about these people, so we have to have that 60-day period to find out about them. The presentence report we're told accompanies the conviction, the prisoner's conviction. So the presentence report will have a fair amount of information about the offender, will it not?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7369 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It would have a fair amount of information. However, in California, the presentence report does not always accompany the inmate and frequently does not. It follows some period of time later from the county.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7370 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But again, that's the kind of administrative problem that would seem easily fixable. I thought the -- the rule or the regulation was that the presentence report is supposed to accompany the conviction.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7371 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But the fact of the matter is, Your Honor, the counties aren't preparing the presentences -- presentence reports in a timely fashion, and -- and they're not sending them --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7372 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, maybe something should be done about that.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7373 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, with the counties, perhaps. But another issue with the presentence report is it doesn't deal with in-prison behavior, and that's what the prison officials need a -- need time to take a look at, is how the inmate is going to react once they get in the prison environment, which is a wholly different environment than a jail environment.

And then I think the reality sets in and -- and things do change. Prison is very different.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7384 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Apart from the gang situation, is there reason to think that their minds change in the sense of inclining them to interracial violence simply because they say, gee, I'm in for a long time?

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7388 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that -- I mean, that goes back to the gang membership situation. It seems to me that's your strongest argument.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7389 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, it's true. But even for members -- people who are not actually members of the gang are subjected to the gang pressures. For instance, if -- if there was going to be a fight, a planned fight, that was going to break out on a yard, members of a prison gang would tell members of -- of their same race that once the fight breaks out, you better be with us because if you're not, we'll deal with you later. And that's even for people who aren't gang members. So the racial pressures in prison are very, very severe. Something --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7390 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But it still seems to me that a new inmate is more likely to be subjected to that pressure with the -- his cellmates than with somebody out in the yard.

But maybe if -- if they had disavowed their gang membership and -- and these particular people could get along, it would certainly be considered. The -- the object, once they get to the permanent housing, is cellmate compatibility. So there are a lot of things that are looked at.

I -- I can see there's a possible plausibility in what you're saying, but in fact is that the reason? Is there any evidence in the record to the effect that that is necessary in transfer situations?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7419 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The officials have deemed that that is an appropriate policy. I think the record is a bit scant in this case.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7426 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's multi-fold. The purpose is multi-fold. First, yes, it is to protect the inmate from -- from having harm done to him in the cell, which is a very difficult area to protect. It's a small area and not easily visible into the -- into the cell directly. Also, that's where they sleep, so at some point the lights will be out. So it's a very difficult situation. Also, they're afraid -- and this is in the record from the testimony of the officials -- that there will be a ripple effect and that the interracial violence, if they were to cell them together, would spill out onto the yards and create the exact ripple effect that Turner -- is one of the considerations in the Turner test.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7429 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honors, at page 41 of the brief. It would be the -- the second paragraph where they examine double-celling only after initial screening.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7432 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- about that standard at least as the Ninth Circuit applied it. They said that you presume the practice constitutional and the challenger has the burden to show that if there were no segregation by race, that violence would not increase. Now, how does someone go about proving that negative?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7433 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in this case the inmate put forth no experts of any kind. There was an opportunity for the inmate to rebut the evidence put forth by the prison officials, and -- and there was no evidence submitted. So in this case he didn't --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7434 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But how would an inmate who was objecting to this racial segregation go about proving such a case? You said one would have to rely on experts.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7435 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That would be one way, Your Honor.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7436 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And so one could put in that Texas study, but you said that wouldn't be good enough.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7437 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the Texas study doesn't -- doesn't apply to the initial intake process.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7438 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So you -- you -- supposing an inmate who would have to call a bevy of experts that he has no wherewithal to -- to pay for -- I mean, you are essentially saying an inmate cannot challenge this policy.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7439 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor. Actually this policy was applied in a California case after the Johnson case was decided in California to strike down a race-based prison policy. So there -- there certainly are instances when the inmate could --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7440 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I asked how would an inmate prove this, and you said you would need experts. So for experts, you need money to pay experts. How does an inmate do that?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7441 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the same way the inmate would do it in any other litigation that is brought by an inmate. The burden is on a litigant to prove their case, and it doesn't change because that litigant is in prison.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7442 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now, why -- why should you use the Turner standard? The Turner standard says to the prison, you can do this as long as you have a modestly good reason. Strict scrutiny says you have to have a very good reason. With free speech, of course, people understand prisons are different. Of course, people's speech rights will be controlled and it won't hurt the rest of society. With racial discrimination, as you heard your opponents argue, it's a terrible symbol, a symbol that we would tolerate without the best of reasons discrimination, invidious discrimination, based on race, which is divisive to the whole society. Now, that they say is a very good reason for not applying the Turner standard but, rather, applying strict scrutiny, which gives you freedom to discriminate on this basis if you can prove you really have to.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7443 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Unlike in a non-prison setting, there aren't other rights to be balanced. In the prison setting, not only are you balancing the inmate's right to be free from discrimination, but you're balancing the -- the rights of all inmates to be free from harm, and as well as the prison officials' duty to protect them from harm. And that is what --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7444 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That -- that same argument could have made in -- in arguing about racial segregation in the schools and -- and in the military and everything else. That's -- that's not an acceptable answer.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7445 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, there's -- there's no -- the prison officials here have an affirmative duty to protect the other inmates under the Eighth Amendment, and --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7446 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Do you accept that this is invidious discrimination on the basis of race? What -- what -- why -- why do you think it's invidious?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7447 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We don't think it's invidious, Your Honor. As a matter of fact --

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7449 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # This is not affirmative action, no. It is not invidious, Justice Scalia. It is simply one consideration of race to control violence in prison, and as the Bureau of Prisons uses in -- in its prisons, they in the United States' brief say that they consider race to maintain racial balance in their prisons for the purpose of diversity. California also considers race in maintaining racial balance in its prisons, not primarily for the purpose of diversity, but for prison safety to make sure that no one group takes over a prison, thus putting members of another group in a vulnerable situation. There are many circumstances when -- when race should be --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7450 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Is that -- is that invidious?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7451 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, it is not, Your Honor.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7452 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Is it affirmative action?
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7453 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. There are many instances in which race needs to be considered on a day-to-day basis in prison. For instance, when the prisoners line up to go to the exercise yard, if 10 white prisoners line up first and the 11th prisoner in line is an African American, it would be extraordinarily ill-advised to release those prisoners in the manner in which they have lined up to go to yard. It would require some reshuffling and maybe even some shifting of prisoners from yard to yard based on their race because to do that would put the minority member at extreme risk. Turner is the appropriate test here because courts --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7454 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I -- I -- this may -- may be important to me for understanding your argument.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7455 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It would be dangerous for the officer to release the inmates onto the yard in the manner that they had self-arrayed because then you would put 10 members or more of one group on the yard and then introduce another member to the yard who was not a member of that group, and that would be very dangerous for the -- the sole person on the yard.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7456 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # And do -- do other prison systems adopt similar policies to try to keep the races mixed generally in --
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7457 # TRUE # MS. GRUNDER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, they do, Your Honor. As I pointed out, Bureau of Prisons being one. As a matter of fact, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Corrections Institute statistics -- and this is not a part of the record -- indicate that 96 percent of all States separate prisoners based on disruptive group or gang orientation. So California is not alone in that. It's a -- it's done to prevent violence to other prisoners. In sum, Turner is the only test that provides the flexibility that prison officials need to safely manage their prisons and protect inmates from harm. The Court should apply it here and affirm the lower court. Thank you.

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7460 # FALSE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The -- the hypotheticals presented by the State of California, when applied in the context of this case, demonstrate the danger of this position of segregation. The petitioner in this case is not a gang member. He's been in the California prison system since 1987 and before. When he reported to the inmate reception center at Chino in 1987, he had already three presentence reports which are reflected in -- in the record of this -- of this case at the joint exhibit 259. He's been transferred five times since then -- since then. There's no record of his having had interracial violence ever during the time that he was in prison. And it is his view, as articulated in his deposition at page 109 of the joint appendix, that he is put into peril because he is an African American who is unable to cross race lines and unable to reach out for support in a heavily racialized setting for other persons who are not African Americans and who are not gang members. So he's been marginalized and treated, based upon his race, in a de jure way when he's transferred for the 60-day period. And incidentally, the reference to a 14-day period is not borne out by the record. The regulation in the State of California specifically provides that this organization or evaluation group has to convene within 14 days, but not have to reach a decision with regard to transfer characterization and classification in 14 days. But -- but the petitioner in this case, because he's black and has no opportunity to cell initially with a white person or a Hispanic person, is then confined to being in this small group of African Americans who are not gang members and who are unable to have an affinity group in which they will feel safe within the California prison system. The California --

argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7463 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # He'd be able to make the same argument.
argument in Johnson against California # 03-636 # 7464 # TRUE # MR. DEIXLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # A white who, for reasons of safety, wished to house with an African American, would be denied that opportunity under California's policy, and the same with an Hispanic who felt it safer for him to house with a black. He could not cross racial lines based upon the evidence in this case, Justice Scalia. That's correct. And the danger which is created in my judgment by a reliance upon a Turner standard in this circumstance is that all that needs to be done is a little bit more of tinkering with the idea of the equivalence between race and gang which cannot exist in this record. And were that to happen, we will create a circumstance where the very arguments rejected in Lee, indeed the very argument advanced by the State of California in this case, will once again be raised time and again, and we will be faced with a circumstance not too far down the slippery slope where, for convenience or for other reasons or for purely invidious reasons, States will be able to return to an era of segregation. This Court's history has demonstrated a commitment to march the country away from the road of segregation, and there should be no turning back. This is a case in which the Ninth Circuit has erred. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be reversed. The Court should determine that strict scrutiny should apply, and it should determine that Petitioner Johnson's equal protection rights were violated.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7567 # TRUE # MR. COMEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's -- that's correct, Your Honor. The -- the Government's position, as with the State of Washington's position, is that the -- the analysis is simply did the facts known to the officer, viewed through the prism of an objectively reasonable officer, establish probable cause. And that to make an evaluation of the arrest turn upon the officer's subjective assessment of those facts -- in other words, the working of his brain, the crunching of those facts that results in the spitting out of a legal conclusion -- is contrary to this Court's precedent and guts the objective reasonable test, and would make, instead, the validity of a Fourth Amendment action turn upon whether the officer is particularly smart, whether he's new, whether he's nervous, whether he says nothing at all or whether he decides to say, you're under arrest for everything listed in the Washington code book. Under those circumstances, the results would be different. The -- the concern that Your Honor raised about police officers engaging in a post hoc rationalization I respectfully suggest is not a concern that is rooted in reality because the facts continue to drive the analysis. Whether or not a police officer is right at the arrest scene in invoking a particular statute, if that turns out to be incorrect, it is still the facts that were known to him that must support probable cause for some other offense.

I also suggest that if this were the concern that the Ninth Circuit were looking to address by the closely related offense doctrine, the remedy sweeps far too broadly in both directions. It punishes officers who at the scene engage in remarkable good faith conduct. I mean, these two police officers I think are what the public would hope these police officers were, looking at a code book at the roadside, calling a prosecutor late at night, trying to get it right. They are punished under this doctrine. Those that are rewarded are those who are smart enough, perhaps a veteran, perhaps someone who has read the Ninth Circuit's cases, to stay completely silent, to say nothing at all, knowing that he's going to be fine. He needs to engage in no --

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7572 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- for the result for which you argue. But in Whren, the stated reason for the stop, traffic enforcement, was lawful, and we didn't have to look any further. In this case, the stated reason I think we assume, at least according to the trial judge's instruction to the jury, was unlawful. Does that impair the reliance on Whren?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7573 # TRUE # MR. COMEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't believe it does, Your Honor. I believe that what Whren teaches is that the subjective working of the police officer's mind, his motives, his intentions, his legal assessments, as in other cases, his legal assessment with respect to the extent of a consent to search, or the reason he's boarding a boat, is irrelevant, that that's for courts to do. What matters is what came into an officer's brain, not what came out as a result of his working on it. Because, as I said, that would make law enforcement far from unevenhanded. It would make it depend upon who the officer was at the roadside on any given night. And those similarly situated would be treated very, very differently, depending upon what an officer chose to say. And as I said, silence in a -- in a jurisdiction that's governed by the closely related offense doctrine is the best course.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7574 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But if -- if we had gone the other way in Whren, we would still have the problem that we have in this case, wouldn't we?

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7576 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But the question here is the scope of the Fourth Amendment inquiry. Can it take in probable cause for reasons other than the reason for the arrest or the stated reason for the arrest? Can it consider other offenses, and we'd have that regardless of -- of Whren, wouldn't we?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7577 # TRUE # MR. COMEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think we would, Your Honor, to the extent that Whren is about motives and this case is about something very closely related, still the inner working of an officer's mind, what legal conclusion he draws from facts.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7578 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why is it subjective? I mean, in -- in Whren, the question was finding a hidden motive as distinguished from the motive that was written out. Here, there's nothing subjective about what the officer charged this person with on the spot. He told him. There wasn't anything hidden in his mind. He said, I'm arresting you for X reason, for tape recording. And then they had a whole colloquy. So what the -- what the arrest was for is as objective as it can be.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7579 # TRUE # MR. COMEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I would suggest, Your Honor, that his speaking, his invocation of a particular code section is an objective manifestation of an essentially subjective process. And that's illustrated by imagining three stops on that road that night, three Mr. Alfords, exact same facts. In one, the officer is engaged in the process that he engaged in here. In the other two, the officer chooses in the first to say nothing, and in the third, to say -- hold up the code book and say what you did is in here. Everything in here applies to you, wise guy. Now get in the car. In those two other circumstances, complete silence and the table of contents approach, we wouldn't be here. These officers would not have been in litigation for 4 years. That to me demonstrates that it is essentially subjective because it is driven not by the facts, what the defendant did, but by the nature of the police officer. Is he clever? Has he gone to law school at night?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7580 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But, of course, even in those examples, there could be a difference in what the police officer had actually observed. He might not have seen the safety sticker or the taillight or whatever it is. So you do have some inquiry into the mental processes of the officer in every case.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7581 # TRUE # MR. COMEY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor. And -- and if -- perhaps my distinction is -- is too homely, but I would say that's about what comes into his mind, into the brain, his senses. Did he see this taillight? Did he see the sticker? Not what comes out of his mouth as a result of the functioning of that brain, his legal brain. The legal work is for the courts looking at an arrest that's been challenged through the prism of an objectively reasonable officer. It does not depend, else Fourth Amendment seizures would be not reasonable, but would vary depending upon the skills of an individual officer from roadside to roadside. And that is utterly inconsistent with this Court's precedent and would, in fact, gut the objective reasonableness test. The Ninth Circuit's rule would lead to dramatically uneven law enforcement. It would, indeed, lead to either stacking or silence, and there's plenty of good reason why an officer or a Federal agent, who are not required to say anything at arrest, might want to inform a defendant of a basis for his arrest and might want to uphold other bases for an arrest, to protect a witness, for example. To drive police officers to the extremes is not in the public interest.

So there is -- and that's one of the things that demonstrates the unworkability of this test because there are plenty of jurisdictions, thousands of Federal agents, who are under no obligation to say anything.

But then they look at his wallet more carefully and they see the permit is expired. What -- what rule then? At the police station, they -- they see the permit is expired.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7597 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I thought at its core it was about this rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted about closely related offenses. I thought at its core that's what we were concerned with.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7598 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, the closely related offense doctrine itself is -- it's in five circuits -- six depending on how you count the cases. But it's designed to -- to look at two things: number one, whether the arrest itself is reasonable; and number two, from a qualified immunity standpoint, whether -- essentially it's a no harm/no foul rule. If the conduct for which the person was arrested is criminal, but the officer merely has a mistake in terminology -- he calls it driving while license suspended instead of reckless driving -- then it actually salvages the arrest for law enforcement.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7599 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, what if the arresting officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day, that indeed there were objective facts that would have justified an arrest. It wasn't what the officer had in mind but he didn't say anything. What result then?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7600 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, that -- that implicates several other rights.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7603 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. At that time, there does. But we're talking about at the time of arrest. And it -- it just -- if the closely related offense doctrine has the effect of punishing an officer for explaining to the suspect a reason for the arrest, why is that a good doctrine? I mean, if the officer could say nothing and could end up, at the end of the day, having a valid arrest, I just think the closely related doctrine doesn't serve a very good purpose.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7604 # TRUE # MR.

He said exactly what it was for, and then he -- when he booked him, Officer Haner even booked him for illegal recording. So in this case, we're -- we're not presented with a vacuum. But even in an instance where the officer did not state at the instant of the arrest why he was arresting the person, one of the benefits of this doctrine is that it would allow for an objective review of the facts in order to determine --
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7605 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, if the objective review shows that there were, indeed, facts that would have justified an arrest, then what's wrong with allowing that to proceed?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7606 # TRUE # MR.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7607 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. What's -- what's happening here is in order to avoid the down side of your test -- as Justice O'Connor puts it, her point is that if we adopt your rule, there's going to be an incentive not to state the reason. Now, in order to avoid that -- you haven't really squarely confronted it -- I think you're suggesting that there has to be an additional rule that the police officer must say why he's arrested, and -- and the authorities just don't establish that. Now, if you want us to go on and make up that rule, I suppose we could make up that rule.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7610 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, to sort of piggyback on what Justice Souter and what Justice Ginsburg had commented on, there's no empirical evidence to suggest that there is or would be a movement by police officers towards silence. There is simply nothing out there that says that police officers have in the past in the six jurisdictions, the six circuits that use this. There's no evidence that they have remained silent in an effort to --

I mean, it's -- it's just obvious what -- what you have to do to make a valid arrest. If you say nothing, any -- any basis that you could have had for the arrest will -- will be used. Whereas, if you -- if you mention something, you better be able to substantiate that particular cause or a closely related crime. Police officers aren't any dumber than the rest of us. I can't believe that -- that that wouldn't be the -- the consequence of -- of the rule you're asking us to adopt.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7614 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, for the most part, Justice Scalia, it does not come back to haunt the officers because the vast majority of arrests are lawful. The vast majority of officers have probable cause for the thing that they arrest the person for, and they arrest him for criminal conduct.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7615 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But if they're told in this case that they're subject to 1983 liability out of their own pockets if they get it wrong, then it seems to me they would pursue the safe course and say nothing. I mean, you did say at one point in your brief that when a warrantless arrest is effected, the officer must inform the arrestee of the officer's authority and cause of arrest. But that's not true on the spot as a matter of Washington law or constitutional law, is it?

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7620 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because, Your Honor, even if the -- even if the cause of the arrest is not stated at the time of the arrest, the person must be booked for something.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7621 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. The booking occurs after arrest, and I thought what we were concerned with in this case was the validity of the arrest, not the booking.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7623 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. Now, if -- if the -- if the -- if it is the validity of arrest, which -- which is in issue, I don't see why your rule is going to make any difference in the long run unless we go the further step and say, in order to make this work, i.e., enforce Fourth Amendment values, at the time of the arrest the cause has got to be stated. Am -- am I missing something?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7624 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I would analogize it to the -- the arrest rule. Whether someone is or is not under arrest from a Fourth Amendment standpoint is based on an objective test, and it is viewed after the fact.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7625 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, based on an objective test, we'll get absolutely nowhere. The person who is arrested is not in a position to be making objective or subjective assessments, by and large. He probably knows what he's being arrested for because it's obvious, but then we have cases like this, which are the only ones that are going to be litigated, and he may not know. The -- the fact still, it seems to me, is obvious. If we go your way, we're going to have to go the further step of requiring the cause to be stated. Isn't that, as a matter of common sense, true?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7626 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It would certainly make it easier, but it's not necessary.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7627 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All right. I'll be candid with you. I think it is necessary. But the -- I guess the -- what I'm getting at in all of this is you're asking us to take steps to solve a problem, and I don't think you've demonstrated what the problem is. We keep coming back, as we have several times, to the lack of empirical studies. Have we got something to worry about in -- in enforcing Fourth Amendment values that we can only guard against if we go your way?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7628 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I would say that the fact that there are six circuits that have adopted this policy shows that this is -- that this is a problem that occurs nationwide.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7630 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The practical problem is that people are being arrested for conduct that is, at its base, not criminal.

I mean, so long as they should have been arrested, who cares? In this case, I mean, it'll -- it'll be ultimately be tried by a jury I -- I guess, but your -- your client pulls up behind another car with wig-wag lights flashing, like a police car. Right? He has a police scanner on the seat next to him. He has handcuffs. He has tinted glass in front of the license plate -- of his license plate, so it can't be -- can't be read. It seems to me there was obvious probable cause to -- to arrest this fellow for impersonating a police officer. And I would have hoped he would have been arrested so he wouldn't go around and -- and pull up behind another car. What is the problem?

First, at the trial court, the State did not argue that he could have been arrested for other crimes. The jury was never instructed on the elements of these supposed other crimes.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7637 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # One of the problems I have with the case, very frankly, is that the jury has already ruled against your client on the qualified immunity issue carrying out instructions given by the judge that were not objected to by your client.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7638 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct, Your Honor, but the only instructions that were given regarding -- regarding what they needed to find to find a violation were the Privacy Act instructions.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7640 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, I think if the State wanted them to -- qualified immunity is an affirmative defense. If they wanted the State to find -- if they wanted the jury to find there was impersonation, they should have requested an instruction on that because impersonation in Washington requires more than simply taking an action that creates an impression that you're an officer. It also -- under first degree, there has to be specific intent to defraud someone, and here the only thing he did, he gave them a flashlight and helped them jack up their car. On the issue of the wig-wag headlights, the transcript shows that the officer spent a minute or 2, by his own estimation, on the scene behind Mr. Alford's car, saw no wig-wag headlights. And as for the scanner, the -- the transcript, page 246 -- he admitted at trial it was actually a ham radio, not a portable police scanner.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7641 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But I thought that the reason that the police went after your client after he left the vehicle that was disabled was because the officers at that point suspected that he might be impersonating a police officer. That's what the people in the -- the disabled vehicle told the officer. They said he had flashing headlights. We thought he was a police officer. And -- and wasn't the original following of your client triggered by the suspicion that he might be impersonating a police officer?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7642 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor, and that -- that -- we have not argued that there was not suspicion sufficient to -- to have a stop to do investigation. However, under the Washington statute, there was not evidence sufficient to show probable cause that there was an actual crime --
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7643 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Under Washington law, is it lawful for your client to have headlights -- wig-wag lights?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7644 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor. It is a traffic violation. That is a non-arrestable offense, and that was admitted at court and also here today.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7649 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So that would -- that would certainly be probable cause to arrest just based on the wig-wag, plus the fact he lied to the police in -- in instructing them the button to push or didn't tell them what button to push to make them go.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7650 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor. The obstruction charge also under Washington law -- under the case law interpreting the statute, there has to not only be the -- the hindrance or obstruction. There has to be specific intent, and there has to be obstruction in fact. And in this case, both of the officers testified that they -- that he pushed every button they asked him to. He opened the hood for them. He let them look at the -- the flasher unit. He showed them the manual. They both say that they saw this button that after the arrest they pushed -- one of them pushed. However, there's obviously no obstruction in fact if -- one of them actually said at trial that he didn't ask him to push the button because he wanted to see whether he would push it or not. So there's no -- again, there's no facts to support a finding of probable cause even on the obstruction because the officers were essentially just letting him hang himself.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7651 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, that -- that isn't the issue before us here. I -- I assume that for purposes of the question on which we granted certiorari, we have to assume, or else the whole thing doesn't make any sense and it's all -- it's all arguing about nothing -- we have to assume that there was probable cause on some other ground than the ground which he stated or anything closely related to the ground which -- which the officer stated. Isn't that -- isn't that the -- the manner in which this case gets to us?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7652 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, we raised the issue at the Ninth Circuit that there had been no evidence put forward on the other crimes. And we pointed out that even the deputy prosecuting attorney -- and in fact, even in closing argument, when they addressed the -- the wig-wag headlights, et cetera, they stated specifically that that information went to what they called his intent to unlawfully record.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7653 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But -- but that's not the ground on which the Ninth Circuit decided it.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7655 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- because it found, even if there was these other grounds, they're not closely related to the illegal taping. So I suppose you're telling us that if we find that we do not like the closely related rule, that it's not part of -- of United States constitutional law, what we should do is remand to the Ninth Circuit so that they could determine whether there was probable cause on the other grounds.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7656 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's exactly right, Your Honor. And in -- in looking at this -- this probable cause determination and the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment, the qualified immunity, of course, was a doctrine that was advanced by the Court to address specific problems.

And the -- in reviewing the transcript and in reviewing the -- the instructions and the ruling on the summary judgment motion, the reason that Senior Judge Bryan did not rule on the qualified immunity was twofold. One, at the time of the summary judgment motion, one of the officers was -- well, was lying about having contacted the prosecutor prior to making the arrest, and he noted in his order that there was a factual dispute. So summary judgment wasn't appropriate. And second, Judge Bryan indicated that essentially there was a problem created by the Saucier opinion because he felt that it was somehow possible that there could have been an arrest effectuated without probable cause, but that there was a reasonable mistake on the part of the officers. So this did not proceed to the jury on the -- on this closely related offense doctrine. It didn't proceed on there were these other crimes for which probable cause existed, but on this broad standard of good faith and reasonable mistake.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7670 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # In our brief, Your Honor, I often used the phrase same conduct test because in amalgamating the six different circuits, that appeared to be the most consistent test and the one that's most consistent with the objective standard and with the reasonableness standard, that if -- and I, again, go to the no harm/no foul. If you're engaging in conduct that would have and should have led to your arrest, if it's the same conduct for which you were arrested and it's simply misnamed, then there essentially is no harm of constitutional magnitude. But otherwise --
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7671 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, then you have a very narrow view of closely related. It comes down to misnomer cases. It's one thing to say -- what the officers told the DA, although after they arrested him -- didn't they describe the whole episode from when they saw Alford pull up behind the disabled vehicle? They described that and they mentioned the flashing lights. They described the whole episode up till the point where they -- the officers apprehended him and saw the equipment and then noticed -- they told the DA everything, and he said, yes, you have probable cause.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7673 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So why couldn't it be related in time and space rather than legally related?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7674 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I'm not urging something as narrow as -- as a semi-Blockburger test. But here you have essentially two discrete conducts that were being examined by the officers: number one, the actions surrounding the headlights; and number two, the actions surrounding the taping. And the trial -- I mean, it was very clear that the two were treated as discrete incidents by the police. At the moment Devenpeck saw the tape recorder -- and he testified at trial. When I saw the recorder in the record mode and saw that it was moving, that's what he stated to him constituted probable cause for the arrest. The moment he saw that tape recorder and saw the play and record buttons were pushed, he informed Mr. Alford, you're under arrest for making an illegal tape recording. So when looking at whether something is -- is sufficiently related or not, obviously there's going to have to be more than a modicum of logic that's used, but objectively this separates rather nicely into two discrete incidents for the analysis.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7675 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why -- why is it exactly that a policeman who comes on a difficult scene, gun in one pocket, the guy has a knife in another, and he throws a punch? Now, the policeman might make a mistake about that. He -- he thought he threw a punch, but he made a mistake. Now -- now, why is a policeman less likely to make that kind of a mistake than make a mistake about what crime to label it?
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7676 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, we're not concerned so much -- this doctrine is not concerned so much with what to label the crime.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7677 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, no. You said -- you -- you say everybody agrees in this case that if the policeman had reasonable cause objectively to arrest the person for A, but he arrested him for B instead, there are some circumstances in which that's okay. And on their view, it's -- as long as -- it was always okay, really, as long as objectively there was reasonable cause. On your view, you're going to add a little thing. You're going to add, and by the way, it's not okay unless that conduct that he looked at was in fact illegal. So you say -- because policemen could make mistakes about labels, but they're not likely to make mistakes about throwing a punch. So I just wondered why not. I mean, they got the wrong guy for throwing the punch. You know, so -- so what? Why is that so -- that -- that supposedly in your view is some terrible constitutional harm, but if he just mislabels it, it's not a terrible constitutional harm. And I'm just puzzled as to where that distinction comes from and why.
argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7678 # TRUE # MR.

argument No. 03 710, Devenpeck against Alford # 03-710 # 7681 # TRUE # MR. PHILLIPS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, if we start with first principles, and the first principle that underlies this case is there is, from the framing area -- era, a general mistrust of warrantless arrests. From that, we step to the reasonableness clause. From the reasonableness clause, we then step to this judicially created qualified immunity, which subsumed the good faith analysis. So what we find is we're stepping further and further away from the original principle. And the -- on the original principles, he was arrested without a warrant. Wrong. Under the Constitution we have reasonableness. Okay. He's arrested. Was it a reasonable arrest? The court has said we generally say that if an arrest has probable cause, then it's reasonable unless there are these exigent circumstances, excessive force, et cetera. Then under qualified immunity, it's even a step more attenuated, that even though there might not have been probable cause, if there was arguable probable cause, then there would be a violation, but no one is going to be liable for it.

BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: There are five primary reasons why this prosecution is outside the scope of anything Congress has authorized. First, the government's interpretation of the wire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule. Second, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by allowing the Government to incarcerate petitioners for 57 months for conduct that has never given rise to civil liability in this country. Third, this prosecution contravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity in matters of international tax enforcement. Fourth, the Government acknowledged below that it cannot bring this prosecution without disregarding another act of Congress, the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which is, as the name specifies, mandatory. And, fifth, under this Court's decisions in McNally and Cleveland, the wire fraud statute applies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into relinquishing something that it holds as money or property. A sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax claim is neither money nor property.

It has done so through the smuggling statute, it has done so through the numerous tax treaties that the Second Circuit's RJR decision discusses at length. And one of the points the RJR decision makes is that, in 1951, at the very time that Congress was looking at the wire fraud statute and enacting it, the Senate was, at the same time, becoming concerned that this country had gone too far in extending reciprocity in connection with its tax treaties and was actually evincing a policy of cutting back on the degree to which we would assist other countries in tax enforcement. And so the issue is to look at -- that the revenue rule must be used as a background principle of common law against which -- against which the revenue -- excuse me, against which the wire fraud statute is --

Certainly, it deters future violations. The sentence was based on the -- an estimate of the intended loss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in Canada to determine what the amount was that was owed. And so the District Court became, essentially, part of the tax enforcement apparatus of the Government of Canada by performing that assessment in the first instance. And so anytime that we impose criminal or civil liability in a manner that affects the tax policies of another country, we are enforcing that rule. If we -- whether we're requiring compliance with the -- with the tax rule of a foreign country or punishing noncompliance. All of those --

argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7746 # TRUE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think there's a certain amount of self-protection in some of the decision -- decisions, surely; but the real -- the underlying purpose of the revenue rule is a recognition that foreign -- that taxes, in general, are a matter of policy. They're inherently policy-based; they're not based on contract or other kinds of commerce. They do not -- they do not assist in resolving disputes between private parties. And often they're imposed -- especially customs duties, are imposed to disadvantage other countries, and so the courts have said these are a peculiar type of law, they serve only the interest of the -- of the foreign sovereign, and there's a particular -- there's been a particular sensitivity about scrutinizing those foreign laws, potentially declaring them invalid under the foreign governments' own laws or pursuant to our own Constitution. And so revenue rules have historically been a categorical exclusion to general principles of comity through which we might otherwise recognize foreign laws or foreign judgments. And the rule has come to be so entrenched, and has been so well established, that there's a whole body of background law in the tax treatise of our country, and of many other countries, that is based on our non-recognition and our non-enforcement of foreign revenue laws. So --
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7747 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But if we did -- if we did enforce even a tax judgment of another country, there would be no U.S. law that would be violated. You're talking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes of another. But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign Relations now, that's put in terms of -- there's no requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or judgments of another; but neither is there any prohibition.

BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Justice Ginsburg, the current restatement is worded in -- addresses judgment specifically. It does not -- it doesn't address un-adjudicated tax codes. But there's always been a much greater suspicion, a much greater reluctance, to get into enforcing a claim brought by a foreign country, where that country's own processes have not been allowed to run their course and to have the initial determination. There -- the restate -- the second Restatement of Foreign Relations law, which is -- was -- came out in 1965 and is closer to reflecting what the law was at the time Congress enacted the wire fraud statute, says, in Section 41, Comment L, "Under the -- under the foreign relations law of the United States, courts in the United States will generally refrain from taking action to give effect to the penal or revenue laws of other states, except as provided by international agreement." And so that -- that was a statement by the -- by the propounders of the -- of the Restatement of what they -- what they believed the law was at the time. To the extent it's qualified, I think it's just to leave room for the fact that the Senate can promulgate treaties, or Congress can, by statute, command that courts recognize these laws. But it's --

If Congress had written a different wire fraud statute that had said, "You can't have a scheme to defraud the revenue, whether foreign or domestic," that would have been a clear statement abrogating the revenue rule.

The -- I would like to get back to the issue of money or property so that it -- to have it conceptually why an unassessed tax claim is not money or property. There is no allegation that -- in the indictment or anywhere -- that the petitioners took any money out of Canada's treasury. So money is not an issue. At most, it was an effort to evade Canada's right to collect money, not any money it had --
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7791 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # You could say the same thing if it were a building fraud. Suppose there were contractors building a Canadian building for the Canadian Government and they had a big fraud scheme down here, and it was to deprive the Canadian Government of money? I think the statute would clearly apply.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7792 # TRUE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The statute only applies -- what McNally said is, any assistance a governmental body obtains from the statute must be in the capacity of property-holder. And so the -- a scheme to defraud somebody out of their -- out of a building, that's traditional property. There's not -- it is not the same thing. Let's have an -- let's take an example of an interference with prospective economic advantage. So there is a defendant who says to somebody else who's about to get a contract -- I know my competitor is about to get a contract, and I say, "Why don't you go out of town? There's a -- there's a much bigger contract that you can get if you fly to Michigan." And, meanwhile, I go in, and I usurp the contract and take it for my own purposes. Well, I've interfered with that person's prospective economic advantage, and so there would be a tort, and the person could collect from me. But I have not taken any money or property from that person that was in his possession. And what McNally and Cleveland point us to is whether there was money or property in the hands of the -- of the victim. And Canada's interest -- until there has been an assessment, Canada's interest is purely that of a -- of a sovereign. It is -- it does not have a claim to any money that is in the bank account of somebody who owes it a debt. And the Johnston case, which we've cited in our reply brief, Your Honor, talks about -- this Court talked about a statute in which there was a boxing promoter who collected fees for the boxing match and also collected taxes at the same time. And the U.S. Government could not bring an embezzlement action against that person for not paying the taxes, because those taxes were not -- were not yet anything that qualified as governmental property.

But to return -- to return to the revenue rule -- and thank you, Justice Stevens, for bringing me back to that -- the Government has acknowledged that there can be no restitution here. And that's in -- that's in the joint appendix, at page 106. They expressly waived it. They said that even if there was a foreign judgment that Canada was trying to bring here, that would be unenforceable. There could be no RICO actions, because that's unenforceable; and no proxy suits on behalf of a foreign government. And so the only thing that they say is, beyond -- is not included -- the only act of enforcement which they say is not included is, somehow, criminal enforcement. And under Section 14 of the -- excuse me, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Congress has power to enforce that amendment, and it has done so both in enacting statutes for civil recovery, as well as criminal recovery -- criminal punishment, excuse me. And so it's -- the notion that somehow incarcerating someone is not -- is not punishment is not something that makes much sense in that context. The decisions of this Court have held that penalties are -- monetary penalties count as punishment, and also that injunctions are -- fall within the scope of the revenue rule. That's in the Wisconsin versus Pelican Insurance case, which actually addresses the penal -- the penal rule, which is the close corollary.

And did that increase the sentence? Did the -- did the sentence vary with the amount of taxes that they -- we found due?
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7806 # TRUE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it very much did. The loss calculation was based on intended loss, and so they -- what the District Court judge did was estimated the number of cases of liquor that were intended to be brought into Canada, and applied that number to the amount of the tax that Canada, he believed, would have applied to that -- to that amount. And that ended up changing the sentence from six months to, in the case of the Pasquantino brothers, 57 months, and the -- and, in the case of Mr. Hilts, 21 months. So the bulk of the sentence was based on the Canadian tax law and our courts making that assessment.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7807 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # A judge making that assessment.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7808 # TRUE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The judge made the sentence -- made the assessment at sentencing, yes. What the -- what the -- what the Government did in this case was to submit, very self-consciously, all of the issues of Canadian tax law to the jury. And the Assistant U.S. Attorney said this to the Fourth Circuit en banc panel several times, that they were presenting these matters of Canadian tax law as factual issues for the jury to find. But, ultimately, in sentencing, it was -- it was the court that ended up imposing and elevating that sentence. If there aren't further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

And the fact that a foreign government is defrauded of tax revenue does not mean that the United States does not have an independent interest in rooting out that scheme and prosecuting it. In addition to the collateral criminal conduct that such schemes can spawn, the creation of such schemes indicates a criminal mind and a criminal group that can turn its techniques for used -- using to smuggle into Canada, also to smuggle back into the United States or to victimize other victims in the United States.

DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- are that people who engage in schemes in this country are capable of then using the same techniques against victims in this country. The third reason is that the creation of international schemes to defraud, like the smuggling scheme in this case, poses independent threats to the United States Government because international criminal organizations are particularly difficult for the United States to deal with. And the fourth reason is that it is an offense to a foreign government, the United States Executive Branch may conclude, to allow our soil and our wires to be used to perpetrate a smuggling scheme against a foreign government with the United States doing nothing about it.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7853 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, if we're concerned about offending the foreign country, then isn't the way to go, in fact, the way Congress has gone in this area, we negotiate treaties? I mean, one of the reasons why we go the treaty route are the kind of problems that Justice Breyer brought up, we want to have reciprocal treaties. We want two things. We want to make sure that it's a basically fair system that we're dealing with. On the other hand, we want to say, "If we do anything with respect to your taxes, we want to make sure that we get the same benefit from you with respect to ours." So never mind the revenue rule, isn't it pervasive that -- when it comes to enforcing tax claims, that the route that Congress has chosen to go, and the Executive, as well, has been the treaty route?

And the only justification -- the only two justifications for seeking to read it narrowly are, first, that there's a common law revenue rule that forms a backdrop for the construction of the statute.

I think you have conceded, in a footnote -- and maybe you're -- almost conceded -- that if this were a RICO case, a civil RICO case, that the Congress enacted the RICO statute against this background rule and that perhaps the RICO case could not go forward. What if it were a federal RICO case and -- the same facts -- would the RICO statute be qualified by the revenue rule?
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7880 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, it would not, Justice Stevens, and that's because of the precise distinction that I drew in response to Justice Scalia's question. This is a suit by the United States Government, as Plaintiff, not by a foreign government, as Plaintiff or prosecutor. The revenue rule essentially concerned with interests of sovereignty. One foreign government should not be able to come into our courts and enforce its sovereign power by using our courts to collect taxes from our citizens.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7881 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # What about the other reasons underlying it, which is what I was trying to get at before? I see, literally, that the common law -- you know, the enforcement rule, this is not literally enforcement. But what I was driving at with my questions is, even though literally it's not, the problems of complexity, the problems of knowability, and the problems of there being so many, many foreign tax laws that we might think are basically unfair, that those considerations apply here, just as they do with the enforcement rule, and then add the fact that turning people into criminals under threat of prosecution by the Federal Government is really very much equivalent to enforcing the foreign rule in a court. I mean, that's the whole thing spelled out. And I meant it seriously, though I used foreign examples to, sort of, drive the point home. What is your response to that?
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7882 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Justice Breyer, first of all, the complexity of foreign tax law is something that would defeat a federal prosecution in which we need to show specific intent to defraud if the law were not sufficiently clear for us to be able to meet that burden. This case illustrates the kind of prosecution that will be brought. There are taxes that are due upon the importation of alcohol. The Petitioners arranged, through the wires, to bring alcohol from Maryland up to New York, and then they got it across the border by not answering questions when asked by customs officials and by not going to secondary inspection when they were asked. In order to bring a criminal prosecution that requires specific intent to defraud, the government is not going to be relying on obscure systems. As to the concern about the enforcement of tax systems that the United States may believe are -- is unfair, that is the prerogative of the Executive Branch to determine in deciding whether a prosecution should be brought in a particular case. This Court has repeatedly recognized that the Executive Branch is the preeminent branch in the area of foreign affairs --
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7883 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # To go to one more aspect of the statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress said that -- with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud and, I think, other things -- that restitution to the victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the government to decide restitution or not. Except here restitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's taxes, so you have conceded no restitution. But it seems to me that Congress thought of the wire/mail fraud statutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and that suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to be the object of the scheme to defraud.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7884 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, the syllogism doesn't track, because the entire scope of the revenue rule, as defined in the common law cases that can be pointed to as the background principle, has to do with a foreign government, or someone acting on its behalf, coming into this country's courts to enforce its tax rules. Here what you have is the United States Government determining that it is in the interest of the United States to bring a criminal prosecution. Now, in this case, the prosecutor did concede below that restitution was not appropriately ordered. That's not the position of the United States. The position of the United States is that restitution under the mandatory statute should be ordered and it does not infringe the revenue rule. But there are --
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7885 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now, how could that be, because restitution is to the victim? The victim is Canada. You collect Congress -- or Canada's tax, and you give it to Canada. Is there any other kind of restitution?
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7886 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, there isn't, Justice Ginsburg, but the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it applies to efforts by the United States Government to secure punishment by -- for a criminal conviction. But, Justice Ginsburg, if the Court were to disagree with that and were to believe that restitution, even when it's been sought by the United States -- not by a foreign government, in its own right, with the power to instigate a lawsuit -- but that even when the United States does it, that somehow falls within the parameters of the common law revenue rule, then the answer to that problem would be to interpret the restitution statute against the background of the revenue rule, not to interpret the wire fraud statute against the background of the revenue rule and hold that a prosecution by the United States is wholly barred. The Petitioner's submission here is really rather extraordinary --
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7887 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The restitution statute is not ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of ambiguities in it. And if I had to find my way out of the restitution problem, I would pick the ambiguous statute to get out, rather than simply saying, "Well, though this restitution statute says this categorically, we will ignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be enforcing the revenue laws of another country." There's nothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another country, if we want to; this is just a question of statutory interpretation. Should this ambiguous statute be interpreted that way? If Congress said, "We're going to enforce Canada's tax laws," there's nothing wrong with that. But --

argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7889 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So you have two statutes. One of them seems to be quite ambiguous. The other one is categorical, you get restitution in all cases. Now, how do I wiggle out of it?

argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7892 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- there's a difference, Justice Scalia, between an ambiguous statute and a broad statute. The wire fraud statute is unequivocally broad, and it has been so interpreted. It's not ambiguous on the question of whether it applies to schemes to defraud that may involve foreign victims; it says "any scheme to defraud." And I think, as Justice Kennedy's questions pointed out earlier, if there were a scheme to defraud a foreign business interest in Canada or a foreign governmental interest in Canada relating to some commercial venture, the wire fraud statute would apply, and --

argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7894 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But you haven't told me -- you haven't told me how you get out of the restitution statute. There's no ambiguity there, and it is not a rule of law that you can't -- it's unconstitutional to enforce the tax laws of Canada. Since it's entirely feasible, and since the text is categorical, how do you get out of the restitution statute?
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7895 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Here is how I get out of it, Justice Scalia. If you think, as I do not, that the revenue rule would bar restitution at the behest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, there is a background principle that says when there is an established rule of the common law, Congress legislates against that background, and unless it makes its intent clear and unequivocal to overcome that background rule of the common law, then the statute will not be interpreted to be in derogation of it. It was that principle that formed the basis for the government's view that Canada cannot come in under the RICO statute --
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7896 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, that view is in -- somewhat in tension with your view that the common law revenue rule doesn't stand in the way of this prosecution. If you have to interpret the statute in light of the general rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes, absent a treaty.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7897 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Justice Ginsburg, there is no common law rule that one country doesn't mess with another country's taxes. What there are, are a set of cases that deal with specific problems in which foreign taxes were at issue. And in all of the 20th century versions of this problem, what you had is a foreign government or an entity, acting at the behest of a foreign government, coming into another country seeking to use that country's courts to enforce its own tax rules. And in that context, the justifications for saying that one country will not enforce another country's revenue laws have to do with the sovereignty interests of the host country. One country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to carry out its own governmental policies, is doing something fundamental to its sovereign existence, and there's no obligation of the United States to assist the foreign government in using its court system to achieve those independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it, either. As Justice Scalia pointed out, it's not unconstitutional, if Congress wanted to allow it. But countries, historically, have not. And that principle does form an important backdrop --

You keep saying there are no cases that do this.

argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7933 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- the revenue rule is that it is a shrinking principle of the common law, not one that has been growing. It originally started out as a principle that allowed countries to avoid invalidating contracts that they believed were in furtherance of commerce. It gradually came under attack, because what it said is that the United States will not notice that a foreign country's laws have been violated in the formation of a contract, and so the contract will be enforced. Commentators recognized that that was contrary to principles of comity and recognition that each country does have a reciprocal interest in acknowledging each other's laws. In the 20th century, those contract cases completely drop out of the picture, and what becomes left are sovereignty cases where a country is seeking to exert its sovereign power inside the United States or inside a foreign country -- the United States, itself, tried it once in Canada -- to collect taxes. And countries said, "We're not going to do that. We're going to leave it to the treaty process." But the rationales that Justice Breyer and Justice Souter have articulated, about complexity of foreign law and odious foreign tax systems, have never been the driving force behind the revenue rule. It's been --

You were very candid in telling us that when Canada put these astronomical taxes on tobacco and alcohol, that was almost an invitation to smugglers. Did we have any discussions with Canada -- I mean, they do have that border, which is rather easy to cross -- about what we were going to do when they put the taxes on liquor sky-high?
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7941 # TRUE # MR. DREEBEN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I am not aware, Justice Ginsburg, of what specific law enforcement conversations occurred, but I can tell you that there is extensive law enforcement cooperation with Canada, as a close neighbor, and that the interests of the United States very much do favor our policing against smuggling here, and Canada policing against smuggling there. Thank you.

argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7944 # FALSE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you. The common law cases universally say that it does not matter who is bringing the claim. It can be the foreign government or it can be another person.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7945 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Can I just ask you to tell us what your strongest case is? Because they did raise that question.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7946 # TRUE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Sure. On the -- on the issue of the identity of the person bringing the claim, the contract cases, Holman and Boucher, stand for that proposition, and the Peter Buchanan case, which came down in 1950, just before the wire fraud statute was enacted -- this was in the Appellate Court in Ireland -- it says, "It is not a question whether the plaintiff is a foreign state or the representative of a foreign state or its revenue authority. In every case, the substance of a claim must be scrutinized. And if it then appears that it is really a suit brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of a foreign revenue, it must be rejected." That's at 1955 A.C. 529. And so with the -- with the Mandatory Restitution Act, this clearly is something to collect the debts of a foreign nation. And the sentencing scheme that Justice Ginsburg alluded to earlier, in which the sentences were enhanced based on the intended loss, demonstrate that this is an enforcement action. Stringam versus Dubois, which is an Alberta case from 1992, involving -- the plaintiff there was an executor of a probate estate, and the court said, "The identity of the plaintiff in the action is not vital if the action indirectly has the effect of enforcing revenue laws of a foreign country." That's at 135 A.C. at page 70. And the way the revenue rule has been cited repeatedly is that it -- what it prevents is not just direct enforcement, but direct or indirect enforcement. And so it is -- the fact that there have not been criminal prosecutions, it clearly would have been in derogation of the common law for a -- for England to pass a statute saying it is criminal in England to break the laws of France.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7947 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # See, he's saying it isn't, for the reason that, he says, that if England did it for independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted to help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have been in derogation. Of course, it would have been legal, either way, but he says it wouldn't have been in derogation, for that reason.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7948 # TRUE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. Well, it clearly would have. There was no common law practice -- we have -- we have not found, in all the research -- and the Government has not found -- any example of a criminal prosecution -- not just in this country; anywhere in the world -- to -- deriving from the violation of a foreign government's tax. And so --
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7949 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You're saying, in effect, that derogation is an effects test, not an intent test.
argument in the case of Pasquantino against the United States # 03-725 # 7950 # TRUE # MS. BRILL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Justice Souter. And the -- in terms of what the government's interests are, there were no deceptive acts in this country. The way the Government gets a material misstatement is by a failure to disclose at the Canadian border, which only -- even though they did not put in evidence of what the -- that Canada even had a law requiring disclosure, the only way there could have been any kind of material misstatement would be if Canadian law required it, not if -- not anything that happened in the United States. In Cleveland, the Court was very clear to point out -- one of the reasons to adopt a rule of lenity in interpreting the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud statute is because violations serve as a predicate for RICO actions and for money-laundering violations. And so what the government's position is, is that we should carve out this ad-hoc exception and allow wire fraud prosecution, even though we would not allow any kind of a civil RICO action and even though we're going to have an ad-hoc exception for the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. But what the Court said in Cleveland is, the way we should do this is by adopting a proper interpretation in the first place, not by -- of the wire fraud statute -- not by having ad-hoc exceptions. And the reference to prosecutorial discretion that there should be faith that the Government will only prosecute, I guess, what the Government regards as exceptional cases is not something that can provide any business involved in an international transaction with any -- with any comfort. And thank you very much.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7955 # FALSE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER #  # Mr. Boas, the Court will hear argument in Small against the United States.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7957 # FALSE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents the issue of whether, when deciding the meaning of a statute, we will focus, as the Government suggests, on two words only, any court, or whether we will look at the statute as a whole, whether we will consider the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme and decide the meaning of the statute by appreciating how sections relate to one another. In this particular case, 922(g)(1) of 18 U.S. Code is a -- represents a merger of two old sections, title IV and title VII, that were passed in 1968 in the Omnibus Crime Control Act. In -- in those -- in that statute, we had two redundant and overlapping sections, and one talked about prohibiting persons who have been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than a year. One, title VII, talked about prohibiting persons convicted in any court of the United States or a State of a felony. There were different penalties, slightly different classes of people. Title IV focused more on the receiver; title VII more on the possessor. But nothing -- nothing about the -- these two titles, about the legislative history suggests that Congress at any time meant something different from the term, any court, in title IV and any court of the United States in title VII. And when these two were merged in 1986 in the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, again, nothing suggests, nothing in the comments, nothing in the statute, that these two terms -- that the elimination of the language, any court of the United States, was --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7958 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I guess we have held, though, several times that Congress meant to define very broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm statutes. Did we not?
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7959 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's -- that's correct, Justice O'Connor. However --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7960 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So it makes it a tougher case when you use the word any because we've given the -- the word any generally a broad definition.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7961 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, earlier this year in the Nixon case, this Court said that when we look at any -- and that was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity. Did it mean any entity, public or private, or any private entity? The Court said any can and does mean different things depending upon the setting, and the Court said when using it broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate results, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the Court did. Now, you're right, Justice O'Connor. This Court has said that the purpose of the felon in possession statute was to be broad and sweeping, but the Government reiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases, Scarborough, Bass, and Lewis, and all three of those cases in which the Court referred to Congress' comments and this Court's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute were 1202(a) cases. And so notwithstanding the fact that the Court said this is a broad statute, each one of those cases, Lewis, Bass, and Scarborough, were cases where by definition the prohibition was against persons convicted in any court of the United States or a State. So that language doesn't help the Government at all because those were 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the Court to any court of the United States. So to take the -- and I -- and -- the simplistic view that as the -- as the Fourth and Sixth Circuit did and as the Government does here, that any means any, without regard to the rest of the statute, is simply -- is -- is too narrow a focus. Let's look at the statute. It's true that the word -- the term, the two words, any court, is not defined. But if we look in the definitions section, the term, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined. And so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase, convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than a year. And that definition says the term, crime punishable by more than a year, excludes any State or Federal antitrust or business regulatory offense. Now, if we exclude from the definition of crime punishable by more than a year and the Government's -- if we exclude from that any State or Federal antitrust law and the Government's interpretation is adopted, then we're left with the anomalous result that if a person is convicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're allowed to possess a firearm. If they're convicted of one in France or England, they can't.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7978 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- because if any only means State or Federal, there was no need to say State or Federal in this provision. You could have simply said any in this provision, just as you said it elsewhere. So one would think that they said State or Federal because they wanted to exclude foreign antitrust matters.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7979 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, this same limitation, Justice Scalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any court said any State or Federal court and the exclusion said any State or Federal court. It's consistent --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7980 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, I don't care how it got there. I'm just saying there -- there -- if -- if any means what you said it means, namely State or Federal, there would have been no need to limit this other provision to State or Federal because the whole statute would only cover State or Federal.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7981 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, but at some point in the statute, Congress has to give an indication of their intent, and this is where it is. For example, there's another limitation immediately following it which says it shall also not include any State offense which is described as a misdemeanor in the State and carries no more than 2 years.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7982 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No. Well, but -- but Justice Scalia's point -- and I -- I think he's correct -- is that this cuts at least as much in favor of the Government as you and probably more because you would make Federal and State unnecessary surplus.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7983 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there has to be some indication --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7984 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # You don't -- you don't set forth the main qualification to the main definition in a -- in a later subsection.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7985 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, if we go further with 921(20), there's another limitation that again clearly deals with States, and that's the restoration of civil rights provision. The Government concedes in their brief -- and that was an effort to essentially statutorily reverse the Dickerson v. Banner Institute case -- that that applies to State situations. The idea that if a person receives a State pardon or his record is expunged, that wouldn't be a disqualifying factor. And they talk about the law of the foreign state being what determines whether it's a conviction or not. Now, clearly we're not looking at going to some pardon process in Germany or Uruguay to decide whether a person still has a conviction. Another part of the statute that's very clear, 924(e)(1). That's the armed career criminal section. That section says that if a person's who's convicted under 922(g)(1), our statute, and has three prior serious drug convictions in a court described in 922(g)(1), then they get 15 years. Now, that definition of serious drug conviction is a State or Federal conviction. Now, let's flip over to 21 U.S.C. 802(44), the drug statute where you have a similar recidivist type of statute where you go from a 5-year mandatory to a 10-year mandatory if you have a prior drug conviction. There in 802(44), a serious drug offense is defined as a State, Federal, or foreign drug offense. So we see that Congress can differentiate when it wants to. Now, they're --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7986 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Would -- would you concede that -- that this is at least sloppy drafting? Because they said any in one place, they said State or Federal in other places. Shouldn't they be -- be consistent in their terminology?
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 7987 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, perhaps they should be more consistent, Justice Ginsburg, but the overall -- I mean, if you go down the list of the prohibitions in 922(g)(1), you can see that the thrust of this is -- is to deal with domestic situations. There's one that says you can't own a firearm if you're a -- a fugitive from law -- a fugitive from justice. That's specifically defined as a fugitive from another State within the United States.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8026 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I think if there was a problem that -- that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less likely the problem of having an American citizen killed by a gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime abroad than it is the problem of somebody having been convicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil or not wearing a veil or something else. If -- if it's either of those two problems that they meant to leave overlooked, I would say it's the latter. They might well have said, well, the courts will take care of that.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8027 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Your Honor, it's unclear what -- what their thought process was in this matter. But I can say this, that the narrow category that escapes the coverage of this statute -- there's nothing to indicate anywhere in any of the debates, in the language of the statute that that's what Congress intended. And again, if you look at the overall view here, I mean, fugitive from justice. It's limited to someone from the State. Person -- let's look at 922(g)(9). Very clear, incapable of misunderstanding. The same prefatory language. A person convicted in any court -- exactly the same, and it ends with the same language -- cannot ship, possess, receive. And what does it say? Instead of saying convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year, it says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And that's defined as a State or Federal misdemeanor.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8028 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Where -- where is that defined?
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8029 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's defined in 921(a)(33), Your Honor. It's specifically limited. Now, here we are. A person who beats his wife in England can have a gun in this country, but a person who commits a business regulatory offense in Germany can't. It makes no sense. The -- it -- it's a very clear statement by Congress that a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence -- they're only intending it to be a State or Federal crime.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8030 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Once again, that -- that cuts both ways. Why would they -- if the text reads the way you say it reads, why did they have to say is a misdemeanor under Federal or State law? Because it wouldn't have mattered. The only courts -- the only convictions that would be covered would be Federal or State convictions. They would not need that -- that qualification.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8031 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # At -- at some point a person has to be told what Congress was intending. This language goes back to '68 where the language in the exclusion limiting it to State -- excluding Federal and State convictions matched the language in the term, any court, in 1202(a), which was title VII. They were -- they were complementing each other. And -- and if you look at even as far back as the Batchelder decision in the '70's from this Court, the Court talked about these two being redundant, overlapping, the only difference being that one uses the term felony, one uses the term crime punishable by more than a year.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8040 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- as far as I understand.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8041 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And -- and by keeping in the exclusions, by -- by looking at 924(e)(1) where it -- what's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you have three prior drug -- serious drug offenses in a court referred to in 922(g)(1), you get 15 years. Those three prior three drug offenses in a court referred to in 922(g)(1) are State or Federal drug offenses by definition. It seems to me that it really couldn't be any more clear. And frankly, to the extent it's not totally clear and it could go either way, I think then the rule of lenity requires that it be decided with a more narrow construction, that is, that any court meant any court of the State or of the United States. I believe it was in the -- in the '90's when this Court's opinion, authored by Justice Thomas in I think it was called Alvarez-Sanchez, dealt with a statute, 3105 dealing with the admissibility of confessions in Federal cases and that they won't be inadmissible if they're taken by any law enforcement official more than 6 hours after the arrest. And the issue what does any mean in terms of any law enforcement official. And the Court said it means any State or Federal law enforcement official. Now, it didn't have to reach the issue of whether it included foreign law enforcement officials, but certain things are obvious without an -- an explanation. And you're right. There was some sloppy drafting here and it could have been more clear, but when we look at the statute as a whole and try to harmonize the various parts of that statute, it would be almost absurd to think, when we look -- and -- and maybe these anomalies won't occur all the time, as you point out, Justice Breyer, but it would almost be absurd to think that with all of these limitations, exclusions, when we run down the list under 922(g)(1), that Congress was talking about any court in the world.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8052 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I -- I'm not familiar with that case.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8054 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's a good one -- that's a good one too, Judge -- Justice. I -- I -- there's -- there's another case that I'd refer to which is the -- the Gonzales case, which is cited by the Government. Gonzales is interesting because it deals with 924(c)(1), which is the section that says you get 5 consecutive years if you're convicted of -- 5 years consecutive to any other sentence if you're convicted of possessing a firearm during the course of a serious drug offense. And in that case, the Court concluded that any other sentence meant any State or Federal sentence, not just a Federal sentence. Now, the Government might argue that that helps them because the -- the defendant in that case wanted it to be limited to any Federal sentence because he was serving a State sentence, and the question was would the 5 years for the 924 violation be consecutive or concurrent, as the trial court gave it. But it -- what the Court did was say any depends on the context of the rest of the statute. And here, we think it means State and Federal. They didn't talk about foreign convictions. You know, it's interesting. It's ironic that -- that while we're debating how American citizens should be impacted by foreign convictions, the administration is unwilling to sign the treaty that would make American citizens subject to the International Criminal Court because there's concern about what would happen to Americans abroad, even in that court, not in a court in -- in Uruguay or in North Korea, but in the International Criminal Court. In fact, in the preliminary findings of the FOPA statute, the -- the Congress said -- and this Court doesn't have to decide and I'm not asking the Court to decide the Second Amendment issue, but Congress found the Second Amendment was a fundamental constitutional right. And the name of the statute is the Firearms Owners' Protection Act. Congress had in mind protecting the owners of firearms when necessary, and --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8055 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # You call that FOPA? That's the name of the statute? (Laughter.)
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8056 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # It's an unfortunate acronym, isn't it? (Laughter.)
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8057 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's right. The spelling is a little bit different, Justice Scalia. But Congress -- the -- the name of the statute tells you something about Congress' intent. The otherwise licit and blameless activity of possessing a firearm isn't the equivalent of selling drugs. Now, maybe if you have a prior drug offense and you're a drug dealer, under 802 of 21, Congress said you get your sentence doubled whether it's a State, Federal, or foreign conviction, but under 924(e) for a conviction under a court defined in 922(g)(1), the prior only ups your sentence if it's a State or Federal conviction. We can't ignore the overall statutory scheme here, which time and time again refers to domestic matters. The Government in their brief says foreign convictions are used all the time, and they give three examples. They say we recognize them for the purpose of extraditing American citizens. They say we recognize them because if you're convicted of a -- a sex offense in certain foreign countries, you have to register here. And they say we recognize them -- I forget what their third reason is. But there's no example that they gave or that they can give where a foreign conviction is ever used anywhere else in this country as an element of the crime. I mean, it's used for recidivist purposes and State courts have debated back and forth whether we're going to double somebody's sentence because of a foreign conviction, but it's never used anywhere else as an element of the crime. This -- this would be a first, and it's pretty significant. To me it's ironic that the Sentencing Commission said you can't use a foreign conviction simply to up somebody a few months in the guidelines. But the Government here argues that we can use it to satisfy an element of the crime --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8058 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Recidivism is an element of the crime. If -- if you have a crime of, you know, repeated felony, recidivism is an element.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8059 # TRUE # MR. BOAS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that -- that's correct, Your Honor. Of course, the -- it's an exception under Apprendi that the -- the prior crime. But what -- what I'm saying is it's -- it's a slightly different situation in terms of it being -- I know we have Blakely and the whole sentencing factor issue. But it -- it's a slightly different use of a prior and making -- in other -- in all those cases, the -- it's a crime whether or not you have a felony. The felony might make it a more serious crime. In our case, this isn't a crime without this felony. That's the thing that makes it a crime. And what I'm saying is the only situation we have where something that's otherwise blameless conduct becomes a crime is the use of a felony. There's no other situation where a foreign felony is employed or has been employed in that situation. If there's no other questions, I'd like to, if it would please the Court, reserve the --

Read naturally, the word any has an expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind. This is not, Justice Ginsburg, a statute where Congress wrote sloppily.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8067 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # There is -- there's an overarching concern and I'll -- I'd like to put it to you right from the beginning. When a legislature legislates, be it the State or Federal Government, it is generally thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick. When Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United States. Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of the time when it is, it says so. And we have a number of cases, not just the Arabian American Oil Company. I mean, that -- the language of title VII was between a State and anyplace outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. And in that very case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to you now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our country, and if it means to say something that will take in other places in the world, it says so clearly. And we don't make the assumption that Congress was intending to have any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells us that. That's my overall concern about the Government's position in this case.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8068 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, this is not an extraterritorial application of a statute.

Most of the times, the vast majority of the times that you see any court in the United States, it -- in the United States Code, it's followed by qualifying terms.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8079 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But the reason you often need qualification is there's -- there's sort of a basic question, does this include State courts as well as -- as well as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out one way or the other.

Again, convicted in any court is rarely employed by Congress. Rarely.

What I'm weighing against that is the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of selling Bibles. That really does happen, and there really were economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European countries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been giving you. And so if you were in Congress -- or -- or why do you think that Congress would have wanted to get the courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair?

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8092 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Lewis v. United States, and that is -- that's really our favorite case, although we like the word of -- definition Gonzales has for any. But in Lewis v. United States, this Court addressed the question whether the ban on possession of firearms by someone convicted of, I'll say, a felony, a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year, applies to -- to convictions that are allegedly unconstitutional under State law or may, in fact, be unconstitutionally entered. They could have been the product of a coerced confession. The allegation there was lack of representation of counsel.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8093 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, that -- that example, which you gave in your brief, gave me this concern. The problem that you've just been describing, the State convictions that may be invalid but is being used under 922, I regard that as a kind of a venue question because you can go back to the State that rendered the conviction and say, State, I was convicted in violation of the Constitution, give me my good habeas writ that I get -- can get from the State. Then I wipe out that conviction and I don't have it anymore. But the person who's been convicted, say, in whatever examples -- take -- Zimbabwe would be another example. Libya. To go back to that system and get a conviction expunged. That's why you can't use a case within the U.S. system where it's a question of where do you go to wipe out your prior conviction. And for someone abroad, there isn't that option.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8094 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, in Daniels v. United States, which dealt with 924, the sentencing enhancement provision, but it has a -- the parallel and incorporates 922(g)(1) convictions, this Court held -- a plurality of this Court held in divided opinions that -- in fact, that the -- the bar -- or that you still count an unconstitutional or allegedly unconstitutional State conviction, even if it was never appealed and that -- and there is no more opportunity for appeal. The time has passed. And under 922(g)(1), we also count.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8095 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that's -- that's a question of waiver or forfeiture. Those are the ordinary rules that apply.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8097 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But -- but there's a basic rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was rendered. And of course, you should abide by the timing rules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing within a federal union. If you're -- if you're attacking what State A does, go to State A, don't tell State C.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8100 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it does certainly in this case. He could have appealed his conviction in Japan and he did not. So he had a forum to do that in. But --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8101 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but you're not building that into your interpretation of the statute at all because you have said in your brief -- and correct me if I've got you wrong -- you don't like what the Third Circuit did. You say just the fact of the conviction counts. Don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair system that comports with fundamental notions of due process. Just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the world. And so what -- what you're telling me is that it doesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he were precluded from appealing for some reason that we would consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your view of this statute.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8102 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That -- that's right, Justice Ginsburg, and that is -- you know, the -- the statute also bars receipt of firearms by anyone who's under indictment. And that application applies even though you can't appeal, except for exceptional circumstances. You can't appeal an indictment. And the 922(g)(1) bar, this Court's decision in Lewis made clear, is that it still applies unless and until your conviction is overturned. So you don't have to have had a -- a conviction vetted through the appellate process before the bar attaches. In -- in the immigration context --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8103 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that's -- that's standard for judgments anyway. When the judgment is final, it means you've gotten through the first -- it has preclusive effect. Almost always, when a judgment is overturned on appeal, then you go back to State 2 and say, look, it's been overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side, almost always State 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post-judgment relief because what we were relying on as our sister State judgment is no longer on the books. I can't imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the same way.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8104 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, certainly in immigration and extradition, you don't get to appeal the validity of your foreign conviction or the -- the processes that led to it. So this is not an alien concept. And it's very important to understand what Congress was doing here. This isn't --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8105 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I'm asking if it's alien in our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in -- extradition is somebody who did somebody -- something abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace. Don't we have to have a treaty?
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8106 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right. We have treaties with more than 100 countries and we don't -- and -- and the courts do not examine the fairness of the proceedings or --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8107 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Because the person is going to be tried in that other system, and we have bound -- within our international system, we say we're part of a world community and we want Japan to extradite people who have done bad things here to the United States, and so similarly, we will extradite to Japan. We don't want them to look at our system and judge it. We're sending somebody to be tried there. So extradition is -- is something entirely different than --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8108 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Although we -- we do also extradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have already been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone could conceive or articulate. So --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8109 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, we have the check already that these are -- these are places with whom we want to do criminal justice business together. So --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8110 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, what we have is the check that the political branches have decided that it's important to attach significance to foreign court --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8111 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And then we have the -- we have the document where it's very clear we want to have extradition with the UK, with Japan. Here, you're relying on the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out like you do in an extradition treaty. And that's the problem here. Sure, if Congress had said we mean foreign court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it means in the extradition context or the deportation context where you have a clear statement that Congress means a tribunal abroad.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8112 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # In fact, in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) which -- which -- admissibility criterion for aliens, convictions of moral turpitude, there's no reference to whether it's a conviction by a foreign court or a domestic court.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8113 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But if somebody is coming into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to someplace abroad.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8114 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. No, it doesn't, Justice Ginsburg, because frequently and throughout that same statute, it refers to convictions in the United States.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8118 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Justice Stevens. And I think that's an important thing here. There has been no contest, for obvious reasons -- we're dealing with Japan -- as to what Congress meant by court. And sometimes if it's Saddam Hussein's --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8119 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And how are we to decide whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory definition of the term court?
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8120 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Through traditional rules of statutory construction. I think that would involve looking at the other -- the -- the background that Congress would have enacted the statute against, first of all, and that -- that may well have -- it may not have been courts of just the United States because, as we know, Congress twice deleted that limitation from the statute.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8121 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But if you concede that there are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court is inherently ambiguous?
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8122 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I am -- I am conceding that -- that it has to be given meaning.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8139 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That -- well, again, just last -- this isn't -- this isn't quite the same context. But just this -- just last term in the Cheney case, this Court recognized the limitations on prosecutors. And in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, in determining the scope of the Fourth Amendment and the capacity to arrest for misdemeanors, this Court recognized that not all checks have to come from the courts. They can come from the political process here. And it's very important to keep in mind that these hypothesized problems, bad applications, are that. Purely hypothesized. This has been on the books for almost 40 years.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8140 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But it's -- it's been on the books for so long with very, very few prosecutions. So it's one -- it's not exactly an urgent question. But it does seem to me if this -- this problem had been brought to the attention of Congress, they would have defined the term court, and I don't -- they haven't done that but probably because they didn't think of the problem. And you can argue, well, they surely would have wanted to have this particular person prosecuted, but would they have wanted everyone with every foreign court all over the world. That's the question.

It said we don't have any way of knowing whether Congress thought about that. That's not the question. Congress passed a statute here. It passed a statute that's been written very carefully. It's passed a statute where the definition of the word any in the statute has already been defined.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8144 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, my -- my problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem with -- with the case is Congress did not just sort of stop when it got to the point that would support your Lewis argument. It went a step -- it went several steps further. But one of the steps further that it went to was -- was in -- in a certain fussiness about the definition of crime, and it said, well, we want to make sure that -- that no State or -- or Federal business criminals are -- are put at a disadvantage by this. It then accepted anything that a State might call a misdemeanor if it carried no more than 2 years. And it just seems very odd to me that Congress would have been that careful in putting these limitations on State and Federal crimes and would totally have ignored any category of crime under foreign law, any conviction under foreign law in -- in light of some of the hypotheses that have been thrown out this morning. It just seems strange that it would have ignored foreign law and foreign courts if it thought they were included.
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8145 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think it's strange at all, Justice Souter, and that is because that the business exception, if I can call it that, is a carve-out. What you have here, in this Court's word, is a sweeping prophylaxis against the misuse of firearms. That's what this Court called it in Lewis, a sweeping prophylaxis. And what Congress did was back out --
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8146 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, it called it that, but it didn't -- it didn't have this issue in front of it.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8154 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But what Congress was doing there was backing out. It was making an exception, and it was doing this against a backdrop of a lot of violence with guns.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8155 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, but how -- how familiar an example is it that price-fixers would -- would be placed in -- in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns?

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8169 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Ms. Millett, there are many lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my generation -- some of them are of that elder age. We learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the penal judgments of another. This is a kind of enforcement of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something like it. Another reason why I would expect a Congress, knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant foreign, foreign. Unlike the context of the immigration, yes, there are some people who left and came back, but many -- and -- and we have all this whole line of cases. Is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know, those go back to the '20's. But this, which came about only because of the merger of two statutes, one saying Federal and State, the other not, and no explanation at all, in light of all these anomalies that have been brought out. Shouldn't we say to Congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you did, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in foreign?
argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8170 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Two answers, Justice Ginsburg. First, this was the second time in 1986 that Congress refused to include that limitation on courts. The prior law, before the 1968 act, specifically referred to courts of the United States, States, and territories. It did not pick up that language in title IV in 1968, and they took it out --

MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But -- but again, I don't think this Court has ever characterized as silence Congress' twice deletion of language from a statute in 1968 and again in 1986. It had it. It looked at it. It took it out. And in 1986 in the Senate report that you were referring to, Justice Ginsburg, earlier, Congress said they -- the conference report said we are rejecting the Senate's definition of felony. The other thing to keep in mind is when Congress enacted this statute in 1968, it also enacted an administrative mechanism for relief that would deal with exactly the uncomfortable situations that have been identified. 925(c) allows an administrative waiver in cases where an individual comes and says I don't want to --

Now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on deciding which is the -- what should the meaning of the word court be? The executive, the legislature, or the judiciary?

Congress stopped funding this administrative mechanism in 1992, and that -- this Court addressed that in the Bean case.

argument in Small against the United States # 03-750 # 8215 # TRUE # MS. MILLETT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because some of -- some of the people who were getting waivers were going out and committing crimes again. Congress here is very concerned about public safety. And this is not -- there was, you know, the question, is there ever an element where you treat this like an element of foreign crime. There aren't -- there aren't crimes normally where you treat indictments or someone being under a restraining order this way. This is not punishing you for your foreign crime. This is a global categorical, class-wide judgment that as a class persons who have committed crimes overseas are more dangerous and may pose exactly the public safety risk we wanted to grab and stop. As a class, they do that. In a particular case, it may not. In a particular case, an indictment might not. Congress was speaking globally. It did so. It threw a broad net. It did so at the time it had an administrative check to deal with these problems. Yes, that's gone. That doesn't retroactively change what the statutory language meant. This Court has said time and time again that this statutory language in 922 was written, in Beecham and Huddleston, with such care that Congress was focused on the difference between the present perfect and the past tense, this Court said in Barrett. This is not sloppy writing. When Congress put any court in and did not carry forward a limitation to the courts of the United States and took that out in another part of the statute in 1986, we have to assume that Congress knew what it was doing. If there are problems here, there is a political process to deal with it. The political process has taken away the administrative waiver. But there has not been -- this hypothesis of bad applications has not arisen. It's hypothesized. And what this statute has -- has been used to do is capture exactly the people Congress wanted to capture. It got exactly the ones who should be disarmed.

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8222 # FALSE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER #  # Mr. Kaplan, you may proceed.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8224 # FALSE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I received word that the Court is interested in 46 U.S.C. 801, and I intend to focus my attention on that before I get into my argument. 46-801 is referred to as the Shipping Act, and it was enacted in 1916 and the amendment in 1918. At that time, the United States Government was involved in a war and we were interested in developing the merchant marine for purposes of transporting cargo, equipment, and people back and forth. And so the amendment that was filed was fashioned after exactly 1 U.S.C. 3, but it had some additional features involved, one of which was that a vessel that was under construction was included as part of the act, one of which was if the owner intended to use the vessel for transportation, it was included. It is under no circumstances affecting a Jones Act claim because the Jones Act requires, number one, a vessel in navigation and it can't be on the dock or being under construction, and if it was under construction, it wouldn't have a crew. So under the circumstances, with all due respect, it is our judgment that we -- we would win on both sides. The Super Scoop would indeed, qualify under that act as well as under 1 U.S.C. 3. But we think that this goes a little too far and not appropriate.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8225 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is the Super Scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8226 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It is more than practically capable, it actually is -- actually transports its equipment and its personnel at work and its --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8227 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Didn't it come from the west -- did it come from the west coast originally?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8228 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Indeed, it did. It came through the west coast, unmanned, however. It came from the west coast through the Panama, through the Gulf, up the east coast, and, sir, if anything had occurred on that trip, that -- that would have been considered a vessel. However, when it came in to Boston --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8229 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But there was nobody on it in that trip.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8230 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Sorry.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8231 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # There was nobody -- there was no one on it --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8232 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In fact, it's unmanned.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8233 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- to be injured.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8234 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There was nobody injured and unmanned, yes, indeed. But what -- what I'm saying is historically there has never been a decision in which a dredge was not considered a vessel until this case that we appear here now. Of course, I'm here to seek to have you overrule the decision that was rendered. But more importantly, we are having a morass in the lower courts, and I'm here to try and persuade this Court to establish, once and for all, that there is a standard, that there is a definition for the use of the word vessel under the Jones Act. Now, in 1920, when the Jones Act was enacted, there was no reference to the use of the word vessel, and we know that when that happens, we have to seek to find what was the meaning, what was the established meaning at that time. And the way we do that is to look first to statutory law, and in addition we look to case law. The statutory law is clear. In 1873 in the revised statutes it makes it very clear that section 3 describes a vessel is any watercraft that -- or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, for transportation on water. With that standard in 1873, this Court in 1907 tried the case of Ellis v. the United States and did apply that revised statute and decided that the dredges that were working in the city of -- in the Boston Harbor were indeed vessels and that the --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8235 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, now, that -- that definition, used or capable of being used -- right, now. After one of the hurricanes, I saw a -- a tugboat that had just been washed up on shore down in the Gulf. What if somebody -- some enterprising person had fitted that out like a -- like a diner, you know, a -- a restaurant and they have staff in the diner and they're serving the meals off of this boat? Now, the boat, apart from the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland, is capable of being -- still capable of being used. Are the employees of that diner covered by the Jones Act?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8236 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Very interesting question, Justice Scalia. However, this Court --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8237 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It -- it goes to whether we want to use, you know, section 3 as -- as our definition.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8238 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This Court seemed to have focused right on point in the cases of Cope in -- Cope was early, 1903, and in the case of Evansville in 1926 when they added the two words, practically capable. The Cope case was a dry-dock and it was run into by somebody and they sought damages. And the Court -- this Court said, wait a minute. In that case, that's a dry-dock. It goes up and down. It doesn't navigate. It doesn't transport people or cargo over water. So they said it's not practically capable of fulfilling under the revised statute. The easiest case is 1926 when this Court again in Evansville made it very clear that a wharf boat, which on occasion was taken out. Once a year, I think the evidence is, they would take it out and move it back. But it was affixed to the land. It had its telephone. It had its sewage. It had all connections to the land. And this Court again used 1 U.S.C. 3, but did say that it wasn't practically capable of performing.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8239 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is that what we would say about all these gambling casino boats that are parked on the side of the Mississippi River?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8240 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, these are a problematic case, and the whole thing is determined on whether or not it's in navigation. If a vessel is --

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8244 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If the gambling boat has lost its ability to be in navigation, if it's affixed to the land, if it has connections to the land, if it doesn't expect to go into navigation, it is out of navigation. It's owner has taken that vessel from a navigable vessel into out of navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8245 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And then what is the standard you use, the definition to use to get to that result? Is this your practically point again?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8246 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Say that again, please.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8247 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # You've given us the answer. What's the standard that you use to get to that answer? Do you go back to the definition that it -- it cannot practicably be used?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8248 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the standard that I'm seeking to have the Court employ is 1 U.S.C., section 3, which says, any -- a vessel is any watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8249 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And then -- and then the riverboat -- it depends on how -- how permanently it's affixed to the land. Suppose it stays there for 10 years. It -- it can go anytime, but it stays there for 10 years.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8250 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If in fact it stays there for 10 years and it does not move, that's evidence that the owner intended that vessel to lose its position in navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8251 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So there's an intent component to your test now?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8252 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There -- there -- technically one could say break the bonds that hold it to the dock and then take it out and use it because once a vessel, always a vessel? The answer is no. According to this Court, this Court said --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8253 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Kaplan?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8254 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- when it's not practically capable of doing it.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8255 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Kaplan, you said two things and I -- I'm wondering whether these are separate or they're really one concept. I thought your answer was going to be to the boat that is used as a diner or to the casino that's tied up to the land, that it's not in navigation. It may satisfy the 1 U.S.C. definition of vessel, but it has to be in navigation to be covered by the Jones Act. So I thought that's what you would -- something that's taken out of navigation would not qualify.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8256 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The answer is no. It -- it does not qualify if it's removed from navigation. Once the vessel is taken out of navigation, as in Justice Scalia's situation where that vessel is on the land, it is being used as a completely different --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8257 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So you say it is a vessel. I thought your answer before was that it was not a vessel because it's not practically capable of being used.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8258 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I say it's not a vessel. It's out of navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8259 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I -- I like Justice Ginsburg's answer better. (Laughter.)
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8260 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It is a vessel but it's not in navigation. Then you could stick with the -- with the section 3 definition. It's capable of being used, so it's a vessel, but --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8261 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But then the question is whether or not it's in navigation at the time of the accident.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8262 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And that only applies --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8263 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And -- and that is a rule that, I take it, you do not wish us to adopt, or maybe you do.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8264 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm trying to establish that if it's in navigation, then it is a vessel. If the owner of that vessel removed it from any chance of navigation, made it a different kind of a vessel, it is no longer in navigation. It remains a vessel, but it's not a vessel in navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8265 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No, but doesn't -- doesn't that put you right back in the problem, the original problem, with -- with the riverboat? If all it is is tied up, it isn't permanently taken out of navigation. It isn't precluded. All they've got to do is cast the lines off and it's out in the water so that the riverboat is the vessel and presumably we've got seamen working on it.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8266 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Souter, if on that situation where all they have to do is cast the lines off and go out to sea, then of course it remains a vessel, and it remains in navigation. And it is -- it fits all the elements of the requirements. But if that --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8267 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So you're saying -- and I -- I don't mean to disagree with you. You're saying, yes, there are going to be a few tough results under this definition.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8268 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There may be, but there's got to be some practically capable influence that this Court has already focused on to say whether that particular vessel is practically capable of being in navigation. If it's out of navigation, it's never going to be back in navigation, and there's nothing more that's going to happen to that as a vessel, then of course it's no longer a vessel that would qualify.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8269 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So -- so what is -- I see the First Circuit as trying to grapple with the very question you're raising, which is I think difficult.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8270 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8271 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Of course, it seems to me fine, let section 3 apply. No problem so far with me. But that is so broadly stated that if you read it literally, my garage door is a boat or a vessel because, after all, it's capable of being used in navigation, if worst came to worst. And now you're trying to narrow it to get out of that absurd result. Well, so did the First Circuit. That's what they were trying to do, and you got caught up in it. But that's -- so -- so what -- that's why I think we're struggling with the words, and -- and perhaps practically -- if you mean by practically that it is not practically capable of navigation, even though it really is, if it just hasn't been used for navigation for a long, long time and has connections to the land like Jimmy's Harborside probably or -- or --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8272 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Like the establishments from the --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8273 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # What?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8274 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- pier 4, yes.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8275 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes, yes, or one like that. But is -- are those the words? Do we need some other words as well? We say practically capable but practically capable has a technical meaning here that it means if there's a close to permanent connection to the land, it doesn't apply?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8276 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Breyer, we're talking primarily of Jones Act.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8277 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8278 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Jones Act requires a relationship between the worker and the vessel. So --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8279 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So could we say -- could we say that, as well, it must be unlike my garage door? A, it must be a -- a structure that normally would have a crew or that -- a significant amount of the time. We would have a connection to the water. It would be capable of having a master or crew. What about that?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8280 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This Court has already established --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8281 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- what the standards are for Jones Act, whether a person qualifies. There are filters between whether a person is a Jones Act seaman or not. For example, there has to be a vessel. There has to be a vessel in navigation. There has to be a economic relationship between the worker and his vessel and he has to contribute towards the mission or to the function of that vessel. He has to, more importantly, have a substantial relationship to his vessel, both with respect to duration and with respect to nature.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8282 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # When you say the function of the vessel, do you mean the function of the vessel in its transportation function?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8283 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8284 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So that would be the answer to the riverboat problem. You'd say sure, if the -- if the riverboat is capable simply of being let go in the water by casting off lines, the riverboat is a vessel. But you don't have to worry about turning all the -- the croupiers and the waiters into seamen because they're not contributing to the transportation function of the vessel.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8285 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Precisely.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8286 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I mean, is that the way out of the problem?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8287 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Precisely? So then the --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8288 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There is a safeguard between the vessel and whether a person qualifies as a Jones Act seaman on that vessel.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8289 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So you -- you think that the person who operates the dredge, since he's not navigating the vessel, is not covered by the Jones Act?

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8318 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They don't hand me any money, I'll tell you. What I'm trying to establish here is that there really is a distinction between the law applicable to whether or not there is a vessel, and I'm suggesting that 1 U.S.C. clearly describes what a vessel is and should be for Jones Act purposes. The second part of the issue is whether or not the individual qualifies and is warranted to have the Jones Act coverage. So as to the vessel -- as to this coverage, we know, through Wilander and through Chandris, this Court has established some very sensible and good standards by which a person can or cannot be a -- a Jones Act seaman. Now the only thing that's necessary is we have to round the circle up to determine what is a vessel for Jones Act purposes. 1 U.S.C. seems to satisfy it. It's important to note that in this particular case this is a Coast Guard-certified, inspected vessel. This vessel is -- carries -- it has a 1290 ton itself and it carries cargo of 466 ton. It is -- it has navigation lights. It has to be ballasted. It has to be load-lined. When it goes to work, the way in which it moves is as follows. The tugs take the anchors out 50 feet. Now, as the operator is using that bucket to dump into the scows, he's also handling the -- the vessel is also moving through its own deck winches. They spool up on their own winches. So in addition to where he's digging, they're also moving so that instead of just digging a hole, they're digging the trench. So under all the circumstances, this Super Scoop, because it has a crew, a captain and a crew of 10, because they have to wear lifesaving devices, because they have a -- a standby vessel for safety purposes right there by order of the Coast Guard, because it is exposed to all the weather and navigation problems that exist in the -- in Boston Harbor, because the risks are inherent in this kind of work, this man qualifies as not only a vessel but as a Jones Act seaman.

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8325 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Oh, indeed. The scow is -- is what they put the fill in, and as differentiated from a barge, a scow has the ability to open up its bottom to let all the fill out when they get out to sea.

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8338 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- why it wasn't the vessel that counts. If it's a vessel and it is in fact the place where he was injured and it was moving, it -- that would be an easy case, but somehow you have to deal with the Super Scoop, and I'm wondering why.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8339 # TRUE # MR. KAPLAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the Super Scoop was not moving at that moment, but the scow was moving --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8340 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, why don't you just say the scow was a vessel? End of case. The scow was a vessel. It was moving. That's where he was injured.

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8346 # FALSE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Justice Ginsburg, I take it the reason that the scow was not relied on is because the petitioner worked 99.9 percent of his time on the Super Scoop and petitioner never made the argument that he had a connection to the scow. But this case, the dredge, the Super Scoop, was a vessel in navigation and it's an easy case under both standards because it remained in service as a means of carrying its workers and equipment as it moved along the Boston Harbor.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8347 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Do you think we need to use the word practical or practically in section 3?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8348 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. I mean, you've -- you've read it in into Evansville and Cope, the -- the dry-dock case, but it's -- it's basically referring to any mobile watercraft that is practically capable of moving either cargo or people.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8349 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why is that reading anything in? I mean, do -- do you think if -- if you were not practically capable, you would be capable?

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8351 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I don't regard that as a reading in at all. I mean, capable means capable. You're either capable or not. If you practically can't be moved, your're not capable.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8352 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's fine, and I think -- like I said, this is an easy case. If I could address some of the -- the --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8353 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why -- why is this an easy case? Because, after all, the First Circuit is struggling with the same problem and they came to the conclusion, use section 3. That's fine. But you know that the garage door is not a vessel, and you also know that Jimmy's Harborside is not a vessel. And you also know that Justice Scalia's beached scow or something is not a vessel. And I take it nor is a vessel a scow that's tied up for 364 days of the year and acts as a picnic place and one day they take it out to sea and -- because they want to move it across the harbor. I guess that isn't a vessel. Is it? Or maybe it is. So why is this so easy? Because the First Circuit --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8354 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Breyer, the --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8355 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- tries to make those distinctions.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8356 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. The -- I respectfully disagree. The First Circuit was way off base. It did not use section 3 of title 1.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8357 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # All right. Let's say it's wrong about that.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8358 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What it did is it --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8359 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Now let's take section 3.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8360 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Okay, let's -- okay, let's go from there.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8361 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And taking section 3, it seems to me, we have the same problems.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8362 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Let me -- let me answer your question.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8363 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And I'd like to know your answer and you just said to Scalia what I thought -- Justice Scalia that I thought what was an answer isn't because I thought that word practical, as co-counsel recommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get rid of a lot of these. Now you're saying no, it doesn't.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8364 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think the -- the -- you look at the physical characteristics and the surrounding circumstances of any type of watercraft, and if it's out there moving, I -- I think that really is an easy case. What I think is bothering -- what was bothering the First Circuit is that this vessel clearly had a stationary purpose. It had two essential and indispensable purposes, one of which was stationary and one of which was a mobile barge. The types of cases that raise problems under 1 U.S.C. 3 is you have things that meet the definition of vessel. The Coast Guard regulates them as vessels, but if they have no function to transport people or things -- and the best example is our country's battleships. They're basically retired vessels. They're museums. And there are some casino boats that function the same way. They have no transportation function. They've been withdrawn from navigation. If you want a legal standard for what in navigation is it's this. It's what the Court said in Chandris, which is it's the status of the ship, and that means does it have some -- is it still servicing as a ship.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8365 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But that goes to in navigation --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8366 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8367 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- not to whether it's a vessel or not. It is still a vessel even if it's beached up on land so long as it is capable of -- of floating. It's just not in navigation, isn't it?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8368 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I agree. The only types of cases where a vessel would lose its status as a vessel if it's been basically -- there -- there are basically two kinds of cases where the casino boats or the museums or hotels have lost their status. And there are basically -- there are two examples. They're boats in a moat. They've been basically landlocked in through concrete or landfilled and they can't go anywhere. And the other one that's -- that's equally as common is pipes and stuff have been driven through the hull of the ship, and they're not practically capable of transporting anything. They'd have to be overhauled.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8369 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Your -- your view of the word in navigation does all the work here. And so a -- a concert ship, which exists, which say is docked at a dock for, let's say, 300 days of the year or maybe 360, and those other 5 days they -- they move it from one town to the next town where it stays for another 4 months, that is in navigation or not?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8370 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We think it's in navigation. If you have a --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8371 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # All right. So then --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8372 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If it's --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8373 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- the concert master and the -- the -- all the orchestra players and everyone else are covered by the Jones Act even though, by the way, none of them has ever moved whatsoever.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8374 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, no. That's not correct. It just means it might be a vessel in navigation. You have cruise ships, military ships, pleasure crafts that sit all the time, some for years, but they're still ready for another voyage when and if they're needed. Those are still in navigation. Now, if you have --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8375 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, if that's so, that's --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8376 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm going to answer your question on the seaman. If you've got a worker that never goes to sea on a vessel in navigation, the place to deal with that is not by saying it's not a vessel or not that it's not in navigation. But this Court emphasized in the Harbor Tug and Barge case, as well as the Chandris case, that there has to be a substantial connection not only in duration but also with respect to nature. And the Court in Harbor Tug said that -- that inquiry will concentrate on whether the employee's duties take him to sea.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8377 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Okay. In the case of the steam shovel operator on the dredge, do we say that -- that he contributes toward that function because it can't move unless he dredges first, so that the -- the whole object of moving across the harbor to dredge includes the -- the dredging part?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8378 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8379 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is that the way we do it?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8380 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There's -- there's a decision in McDermott v. Wilander that expressly holds that the worker need not aid in the navigation of the ship.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8381 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's right.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8382 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Bartenders, croupiers, waitresses, et cetera on cruise ships are all seamen. That's just the holding of McDermott v. Wilander. Now, there's still a separate question of whether they're exposed to the perils of sea.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8383 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So as long as -- as long as somebody is -- is engaged in a navigation --

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8394 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But it says --

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8396 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- in terms of both its duration and its nature, i.e., a connection to a vessel --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8397 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Vessel in navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8398 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- in navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8399 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, and I -- Harbor Tug v. Barge, which is a later opinion, explains that that test will look at whether the employee's duties take him or her to sea. Now, in this case the dredges operate not only -- only on the water, but they're out there usually away from shore and are engaged in regular movement over navigable waters. And the workers on that dredge, such as petitioner, are subject to the traditional perils of navigation which include not only collision with ships, but even capsizing. Barges such as dredges are particularly susceptible to capsizing because their distance between the deck of the barge and the water, which is known as the freeboard, is low. In this case it was only 5 feet, and they have a high center of gravity because of those derricks or cranes that are holding the bucket ship. And if it's operating in poor weather or for some reason it's overloaded, they can tip over and you have a marine incident or even casualties. And this worker was exposed to the perils of navigation like other traditional seamen. And this Court -- we think it's pretty telling that the Court basically in two decisions has resolved this case. You have already used 1 U.S.C. 3 in the Norton case in defining what is a vessel for purposes of the seamen exclusion in the Longshore Act. And then in the Ellis decision, this Court has already held that a dredge, including the scows that were accompanying that dredge, were vessels for purposes of 1 U.S.C. 3 and that the workers were seamen and that they were basically called upon to perform the duties, more or less, of ordinary seamen. And every other court that had looked at the issue and passed on it had equally held that dredges were vessels for a variety of maritime purposes. That was seamen's liens, limitation of liability, and -- and the overtime -- overtime laws in the Ellis case.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8400 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Ms. Blatt, the -- there was a brief filed by Signal I think that argues that a Jones Act vessel has to provide food, care and lodging to be covered.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8401 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. With due respect to the author, I think that approach is novel, it's radical, and it's unsubstantiated. Never has the definition of vessel turned on whether the watercraft has sleeping quarters.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8402 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Are there problems in computing maintenance and cure in a case like this one?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8403 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It's usually governed by the collective bargaining agreement. I think it's something like $40 a day, and this petitioner was a union laborer. And it's -- it's usually governed --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8404 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Suppose it were just left up to the law. Are there problems in computing what cure and maintenance --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8405 # TRUE # MS. BLATT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There used to be, but in -- there used to be a debate, which I think most of the cases the Signal brief is relying on, in how long maintenance and cure goes for and it was a rather kind of arcane, tricky thing, but basically this Court resolved it in 1930. It goes to maximum cure, until the seamen can no longer be cured. And there used to be a debate about should it just go to the extent of the wage contract or to some longer point, and the Court resolved that. But there is no case that has ever even discussed the fact that a vessel turns on whether it has sleeping quarters. And we think that brief is also fatally undermined by the decision in Ellis and all the -- decision in Ellis already holding that vessels -- or the workers were seamen, and there was never been a discussion in those dredge cases about whether they had sleeping quarters. Several of those cases -- the most oft-cited one is that Saylor v. Taylor case out of the Fourth Circuit, was a maritime lien case, and those are exactly the type of workers that this Court in McDermott said were seamen who were intended to be covered under the Jones Act. If there are no questions, we would ask that the First Circuit's decision be reversed.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8406 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Connelly.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8408 # FALSE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This Court in Chandris and in Harbor Tug stated that the basic point of trying to be reached is to separate lien-based employees from sea-based employees. This Court also stated that was Congress' goal in passing the Jones Act. The Court wrote: the Jones Act remedy is reserved for employees whose work regularly exposes them to the special hazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to the sea in ships are subjected. The First Circuit's ruling is much more likely to get to that result. The goal that this Court stated was Congress' goal then is section -- excuse me -- 1 U.S.C., section 3. Justice O'Connor, your first question had to do with the casino boats, and that is a point that I was going to raise. Those casino boats are traditional vessels plying the rivers and used mostly in the Midwest and -- and the Great Lakes. Those States have recently over the last 3 or 4 years changed their law. The law had been that they had to go up to -- out into navigation. They've now changed them and said, no, you must stay dockside. All they are is tied up dockside. They can be untied and moved out at any time. The cases that -- and you're probably going to have some before you -- are dealing with dealers and waiters and waitresses who go aboard the casino boat and maybe fall down in the kitchen or something and are injured. They have never been on the boat while it was moved and it hasn't moved for the last several years.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8409 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, that might affect the decision of whether they are seamen covered under the Jones Act. It might still be a vessel.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8410 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8411 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But there may be other aspects of the test that aren't met --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8412 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But breaking it down --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8413 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- when the thing is tied up.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8414 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Breaking it down, Your Honor, if the petitioner has his way, those tests are met. The first test is whether it's a vessel. It is a vessel. Second test, whether it's in navigation. The Government has just told you, and it states in its brief, any vessel that had any transportation purpose at all that is still not -- unless it's mothballed -- and I think they said today either pipes driven through it or in cement -- is a vessel in navigation. So it is a vessel in navigation. We know that the --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8415 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I think it might be a vessel, but probably not in navigation while it's tied up or in mothballs.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8416 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Again, Your Honor, all it is is tied to the pier. The Government has taken the position, as has petitioner, in their briefs and here today that it's still in navigation if it can be used.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8417 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but I think what the Government has said is that though it's in navigation, we have a case that says that the -- that the seaman's connection to the ship has to be related to the functioning of the ship in navigation. He doesn't have to navigate it, but he has to be working at what the ship does in the course of its navigation, and a dredge operator does that.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8418 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I don't think a dredge operator does that any more than the waiter on the casino. The dredge operator -- the dredge is there to do construction work. It is there to dredge. The casino is there to have people gamble and serve them drinks.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8419 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But isn't -- isn't that the point? The dredge is there necessarily to move. The casino is not there necessarily to move.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8420 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it is our position -- and as shared by some of the First Circuit -- that the movement of the dredge was incidental. Once --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8421 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Should we clarify that? Because I don't -- I didn't read the case saying what Justice Scalia just said or what you -- what it says is that a seaman must have a connection to a substantial -- in terms of duration and nature connection to a vessel in navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8422 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8423 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Obviously, a croupier has such a connection.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8424 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8425 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It doesn't say anything about being connected to the navigating part.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8426 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct, and this Court handled that in Wilander, Your Honor, that it said in --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8427 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Not to the navigating part but to what the vessel is doing in the course of its being in navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8428 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If the term, Your Honor, in navigation, had the bite that I think it should have, then we may not be here today at all. The First Circuit was actually looking at the actual transportation function, assuming that it had to be into navigation. What the -- what the petitioner wants is 1 U.S.C., section 3 which looks at theoretical transportation, a mere capability. And Your Honor, I understand what you said, Justice Scalia, that to you, they're the same, practical capability or capability. But to the petitioner and the Government, they are far different. In both of their briefs, they have said that without the Evansville change in the language of the statute which adds practical capability, both have agreed that it is overly inclusive a statute, 1 U.S.C., section 3. It includes everything and including Justice Breyer's garage door.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8429 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But as Mr. Kaplan pointed out, all -- the fact that something is a vessel doesn't mean there's Jones Act coverage, and I think Mr. Kaplan was getting to the perils of the sea. Someone who's working on a boat that is not in the water day in and day out is never exposed to the perils of the sea.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8430 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, the perils of the sea, which this Court discussed at length in the Papai case, we -- we say that -- that is further evidence that Mr. Stewart is not entitled to Jones Act remedies. Mr. Stewart was on a construction site. It happened to be a work platform in site of land. He was never more than 500 yards off the coast. The dangers that he was up against were more akin to that of a construction worker or, at the very least, a harbor worker or a stevedore. They were not the same perils that are normally faced by a true seaman. Now --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8431 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # One peril was a collision with another vessel, and that's exactly what happened here.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8432 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We disagree with that, Your Honor. This was a situation where the Super Scoop was -- was moored. It was anchored and stationary, again as a stationary work platform. The scow was just being brought from one side to the other alongside -- attached to it at all time by -- by cables and by the crane. The -- the -- he got jostled and he fell. No different than harbor workers and stevedores face everyday when they're unloading ships and working on harbors.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8433 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Suppose there had been -- suppose there had been very rough water --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8434 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # They would have sent everyone home.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8435 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- and -- and the crane operator was the -- was operating it and the water came over the freeboard and it capsized. That's -- that would be the perils of the sea, wouldn't it?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8436 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, because we are in the protected harbors of the -- of Boston Harbor --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8437 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. This is my -- this is a special day in Boston -- (Laughter.)
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8438 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- which -- which they have --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8439 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That happened a week ago.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8440 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- every 86 years or something. (Laughter.)
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8441 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It happens every -- every 86 years they have one of these storms. (Laughter.)
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8442 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8443 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So far.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8444 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I think in that -- in that -- using your hypothetical, it's a construction platform right off the coast. They'd send everyone home. If there was any trouble with the sea, the -- the greatest perils that are discussed in the petitioner's brief -- and they list them all -- one of them is isolation and far away from home and far from aid. Those don't apply to Mr. Stewart. Mr. Stewart would be sent home if there was too much -- the weather got bad. He would be sent home in a -- in a minute or 2. He lived right in Boston. He was in the middle of a large city. There was no major danger of isolation. That -- the Super Scoop was inspected regularly by the State, Federal, and Government officials and by the general contractor on the job. There was no isolation. All of the perils that have been listed by --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8445 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And -- and by the Coast Guard.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8446 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The Coast Guard also. I'm not sure they went out on a regular basis, but they did inspect the -- the Super Scoop at -- at some point. There's no question about that. This Court --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8447 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You're not contending that anything that happens in a harbor is not exposed to the perils of the sea, are you?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8448 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor. This Court in Cope and earlier cases has long equated a vessel with transportation. That's what the First Circuit did. They -- they needed a bright line. They chose a bright line, and the bright line was transportation. Is the structure primarily engaged in transportation or commerce? And navigation, transportation, and commerce are all intermixed, and -- and the definitions include each other. And they found that it was not primarily engaged in transportation. It was primarily a work platform doing construction.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8449 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But how do you -- how can you possibly describe as a bright line test anything that says you have to identify the primary function? Plus, even if it's not its primary function, if it happens to be moving at the time of the accident, then there's coverage. That doesn't seem to me very bright line.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8450 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, what it is, I believe, is a bright line test with an exception. And the Stewart case talked about the DiGiovanni exception, which falls very closely to -- to what Justice Stevens wrote in his concurring opinion in the Chandris case, that it is unfair that somebody who was actually injured while a -- a vessel or -- or structure is in actual navigation does not get at least a second bite at the apple and that that person cannot be -- said to be a Jones Act seaman.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8451 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Even though the identical accident happens to his buddy 10 minutes before when the vessel isn't moving.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8452 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, at no time during the 1 and a half years that Mr. Stewart was in the harbor, as far as we know from the record, was the Super Scoop in transportation. The incidental movement of -- of pulling forward a few feet with its anchors is not navigation or transport -- transportation. The First Circuit stated that the movement of the scow was both immaterial because, as the Government has already admitted, he wasn't tied to the scow. His -- his time was spent on the Super Scoop, but also incidental, Your Honor, because it was just slight movement along the site. It wasn't transportation or navigation. At no point -- and -- and the petitioner has put their spin on this that -- stating that Mr. Stewart every day he was out there moved in and out of coverage. That's not true. He was never in Jones Act coverage. And Your Honor --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8453 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I -- I guess I could agree with you if -- if I believed that I had to look to the primary purpose, whether the primary purpose of the vessel was transportation. But what -- what do you do about gambling ships that, you know, they -- they sail out beyond the 2-mile limit and then come right back to where they left? Now, people get on board not to get transported. They get on board to gamble. And the purpose of the ship, the primary purpose of the ship, is gambling. You think that -- that -- the -- the seamen who -- who are on that ship, which regularly goes out beyond the 2-mile limit, you think that they're -- that they're not covered by the Jones Act?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8454 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think in that situation, Your Honor, it's -- it's a closer call, that they --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8455 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I don't think it's close at all. I think they're obviously covered by the Jones Act.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8456 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is a traditional trip -- ship and those people are engaged in a form of transport --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8457 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But -- but that's not the primary purpose of -- of the ship, just as the primary purpose of this scow is -- of -- of this dredge is not transportation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8458 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # In that situation, Your Honor, it would be -- it would be a primary purpose, though, that transporting the people who happen to be gambling --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8459 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Oh, a primary purpose? Now, you're getting a little fuzzy there. I thought you said the primary purpose.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8460 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in the First Circuit --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8461 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It has to be a primary purpose.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8462 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, in the Manuel court, the Fifth Circuit actually uses the term, a primary purpose.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8463 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # A. Oh.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8464 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And -- and I think -- and to a degree that --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8465 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And you think that's not fuzzy. (Laughter.)
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8466 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's an -- it's an oxymoron, Your Honor. But what -- what the First Circuit was doing in -- in the Stewart case is -- is similar to what this Court did in Chandris. It was looking at a temporal view. A worker -- and the temporal view used by this Court in Chandris was looking at what the worker was doing. What were his duties? He isn't going to be denied Jones Act coverage because he happened to be an office worker 2 months before if his duties had changed and he was now a Jones Act seaman, nor if he fell in the office, after he had been reassigned to the office, was he going to gain Jones Act seaman status just because he spent the last 2 years on the vessel. That is what the First Circuit has done in terms of the vessel as well, not just the work but in terms of the vessel. Do not look at what this vessel did in the past. Do not look at what it did -- might do in the -- in the future. It's transportation from California through the Panama Canal up the east coast is immaterial. You should look at the worker who is claiming Jones Act status, his relationship to the structure and what the structure's purpose was and business was during that relationship. During the 1 and a half years that he was associated with it, it wasn't transporting anything. It was used as a -- a work platform only, only a structure, and it wasn't transporting anything during that time. The same thing with the casino boats, these individuals who go upon the casinos as a waitress and are never -- never leave the port, never leave the dock shouldn't be entitled to the special protections of the Jones Act. They face none of the perils of -- of the sea or of -- of perils of -- of navigation.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8467 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # There's a difference to this extent, would you agree, that something that's just tied up to the dock and never moves is different from something that is actually in the water and whether you call it transportation, it is moving? It has to move to engage in the construction of this tunnel.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8468 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, this Court has decided, I believe it was in Chandris, that a -- a seaman doesn't lose his seaman status just because the vessel he's assigned to is now in -- in port. They wanted -- they didn't want a person to go in and out too many --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8469 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I'm just -- let's focus on what is a vessel because someone -- it may be a vessel but the injured person may not be a seaman. Those are two different things. This is only the first step. So when you're bringing in what the worker does, whether it's a croupier or whatever, the only question that we are considering is, is this dredge a vessel? We're not involved with the question of whether the worker is a seaman unless we pass that basic threshold.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8470 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct, Your Honor, but of course, the ultimate issue the Court is trying to arrive at is whether or not Mr. Stewart is a Jones Act seaman. And this Court has held for him to be a Jones Act seaman, it must be a vessel in navigation. I don't think that that can be separated, that just looking at a vessel. 1 U.S.C., section 3, which the petitioner wishes, of course, everything -- everything that floats that is capable of transportation is -- is a vessel. The First Circuit has -- has used a much more narrow definition but focusing on the purpose and primary use of the structure because it is trying to get to where this Court was trying to get. Is it a vessel in navigation?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8471 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Is it -- is it the vessel that's the problem? Why -- why do you focus on the vessel? It seems to me most of your argument has gone to whether it's in navigation. Can you be a vessel that is not in navigation?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8472 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8473 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Of course, you can or you wouldn't have the -- the combination of the two terms appearing anywhere. So why isn't the problem here not whether it's a vessel but whether it's in navigation?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8474 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, again, Your Honor, if -- if in navigation means what it should mean, which is an instrument for transportation or commerce over navigable waters, and not simply as the petitioner and the Government want it to mean that anything that once might have been in navigable waters and stays in navigable waters and isn't mothballed is still in navigation -- if it means what it should mean, then that's something I think the First Circuit is -- was trying to get to anyway. They -- they were looking at it in terms of vessel status, vessel in navigation versus just in navigation. They -- they were trying to get there and that's why they used what is really a -- a temporal look and looked at what was the business use.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8475 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, exactly. And -- and in Chandris, this Court rejected the snapshot approach to determining what's a vessel and the First Circuit seemed to go back to that. And certainly what the First Circuit did seems in serious tension with this Court's cases. It just didn't follow the same line that we had outlined.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8476 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The First Circuit does -- the First Circuit rule, Your Honor, in DiGiovanni and Fall and Stewart does have a snapshot exception.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8477 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8478 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There's the main rule which has a bright line --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8479 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Right, and that was rejected by this Court in Chandris. So I -- I think there's a problem here.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8480 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Your Honor, there -- there are always -- and this is answering Justice Ginsburg's question earlier as well. There are always going to be difficult situations where some people, doing the exact same work, using the same equipment on the same structure, some are covered and some are not, a situation where one has the requisite connection 30 or 40 percent to a vessel, the other person doing the same work next to him only has 10 percent. One is covered.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8481 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but it might be much simpler to rely on 1 U.S. Code, section 3 and our -- our definition, as we've described it there, and then deal with other situations within the framework of the definition of seaman and the other issues that arise. And it seems like the First Circuit went backwards from Chandris back to Giovanni which basically had been rejected. So that's the concern.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8482 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, again, I -- I think that if 1 U.S.C., section 3 is adopted, then every vessel capable --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8483 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Congress adopted that.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8484 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I don't -- I don't agree, Your Honor. The way -- the way we look at the congressional intent -- this Court has already decided in -- in several cases that Congress left it to the Court to decide which persons are -- should be granted Jones Act seaman status. This is what the Court has said. Why then would the Congress in -- in the same statutes have sort of handcuffed the Court by saying it's for you to decide who's a Jones Act seaman and who's entitled to those special protections, but we're going to handcuff you and -- and say this is what you have to decide as far as vessel is concerned? 1 U.S.C., section 3 was not followed. I should also point out that the petitioner is a recent convert to this position, and it -- it hasn't been followed in the circuits at all. There isn't a lot of cases out there where a lot of circuit judges have stated section 3 should be the definition for the Jones Act.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8485 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # If -- if you go -- I thought vessel -- the word vessel appears in our cases. It doesn't appear in the Jones Act. Am I right or not about that?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8486 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It does not appear in the Jones Act --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8487 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All right. So we have a degree of freedom on this. But -- but the -- the question then is, is it -- how -- I'm getting the impression from you and -- and from the SG that it's rather deeply embedded in the law, if we start reading the Fifth Circuit cases, that if we define X as a vessel, automatically it is a vessel in navigation, that the cases have said the word in navigation mean nothing, with one exception. The exception is if you actually have like a physical cemented connection to the land so they can't escape. Otherwise, if it's just tied up at a dock, even if it never goes to sea, those words, in navigation, have no meaning. If it's a vessel, it's a vessel in navigation. If it's my garage door, my garage door, which can float, is a vessel in navigation. Now, how accurate is that assumption I'm now making? What would I read in the law? Is that definition of in navigation as meaning virtually nothing really embedded in the law?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8488 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It is pursuant to what -- the petitioner and the Government's view.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8489 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I know it is but what is your view?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8490 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # My view is that it shouldn't be, that it should have some bite to it. It should mean, as -- as I stated before, an instrument of commerce or transportation over navigable waters. But that's not what it has come to mean in a lot of the circuits below. It has come to mean something that's just simply in navigable waters no matter how many years it has gone without --
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8491 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, would it help? Suppose we were to say it was -- had to be capable, at least, of having a captain and crew?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8492 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I have never thought of that, Your Honor.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8493 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Then we better not do anything for the first time. (Laughter.)
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8494 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I think in that in that situation, there are -- there can be vessels involved with transportation, getting back to the Cope case and other cases, where there -- it's -- it's a barge being towed, but it's transporting things. We're not disputing that. I don't think it needs to have a captain and crew necessarily to be a -- considered a vessel in navigation. But you hit the nail on the head, Your Honor, and that's -- that's where the First Circuit was befuddled in -- in trying to come up with a regional -- reasonable test because they're dealing with this situation where it seemed like everything is a vessel in navigation. And yet, that doesn't serve Congress' intent of only persons who face the perils of the sea are entitled to the special protections under the Jones Act.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8495 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The -- the word vessel does appear in the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8496 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8497 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And this is the -- the only purpose of the vessel inquiry that we're involved in is to -- to say is this person within one injury compensation scheme or another.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8498 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8499 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now why, in making that inquiry, should the courts go off on their own and be inventive and come up with a definition when Congress has given a definition that can be used by default? If Congress thinks it should be other than the general definition they have provided, Congress can also do that. But in the meantime, why should the courts go creating definitions instead of using the one that's right there in the statute book?
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8500 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because this Court effectively overruled the definition or decided not to use it in the Evansville case. It saw in that case that it would not just rely on the section 3 language. It would add the word practically, practically capable, and -- and not just capable because the Court saw that in Evansville the wharf boat, which they determined was not a vessel, even though again not dealing with the Jones Act, it was capable of transportation, but it wasn't practically capable of transportation. So the --

Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8505 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- just construing instead of not following, but say by capable, Congress must mean practically capable.
Mr. Kaplan # 03-814 # 8506 # TRUE # MR. CONNELLY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor -- and I realize that is what Justice Scalia said earlier. The position of the petitioner, as he stated as he was standing here not too many minutes ago, was that they seek to have the Court employ 1 U.S.C., section 3, not the Evansville change to that section. They -- they see it as quite different and it's in both of their briefs, that Evansville did change 1 U.S.C., section 3. The petitioner's position is that this Court is bound by -- to follow 1 U.S.C., section 3 because Congress says so. It is our position that they're not so bound. If you're bound -- if you're not bound, why take a faulty definition such as section 3 and try to change it a little bit? You're -- you're free to as -- as you are, to determine who is a Jones Act seaman. You're free to determine what is a vessel in navigation or a vessel pertaining to the -- the Jones Act. 1 U.S.C., section 3 was never referenced in the Longshore Act. Congress at that time, many years before and many years after, has passed many statutes in which vessel is defined. Sometimes they reference section 3; other times they write in a definition. Sometimes it's similar to section 3, sometimes quite different. In this case -- for the Longshore Act, they decided to leave it to the courts. The Jones Act was passed in 1920. Its predecessor was the Act of 1915. That act did have a definition of vessel that was very restrictive and actually talked about actual navigation. In 1920, the Merchant Marine Act was passed and it -- that portion of it had a very large definition, which was already discussed earlier, the Shipping Act definition. The Jones Act didn't adopt that one and it didn't adopt the one in 1915. The -- the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act was passed in 1927. Certainly by that point they knew that they had just jettisoned two definitions 7 years before. They chose again to leave it to the courts. In 1972 and again in 1984, there were considerable amendments that Congress did to the Longshore Act. At that time, they certainly knew -- and there's always been heavy -- heavy lobbying going on in Congress every time that they try to touch the Longshore Act or -- or the Jones Act. They knew by that point in time that the circuits were not using section 3 as the definition for Jones Act vessel. Again, they chose to leave it to the courts. They did not intercede and then reference section 3 or incorporate a definition like it or something. They again chose not to. In 1920, section 3 was certainly not the only definition of vessel. Benedict on Admiralty, which this Court has cited several times, which the petitioner has cited, had a completely different definition of -- of vessel, and that could have been the one that Congress had in mind. I realize it's always dangerous to mention the Congressional Record, but most of the people who spoke in 1920 and again in -- mainly in 1927 were discussing traditional vessels and vessels on a voyage. If they had true seamen in mind, they probably had more of a traditional vessel in mind. Also looking at the record, when the House wanted to include everybody, all seamen, into the Longshore Act, they listed out various structures such as dredges and barges. Obviously, a compromise was reached with the Senate, and when the act was passed, they limited it, not just seamen and -- and but only to masters and members of crews of vessels. They limited it to that and left it, of course, to the courts to decide who is entitled to the Jones Act status. If I may have a second, Your Honor. The term vessel can and often has had a different meaning for the Jones Act, which this Court has stated is a vessel in navigation, than it does with the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act. In his amicus brief filed on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Hillsman writes that the lower court unanimously -- unanimously -- have decided that the definition of vessel for purposes of the Longshore Act is much, much more inclusive than it is for the Jones Act, and it has worked perfectly fine. Under the Longshore Act, most of the persons who collect Longshore benefits only have to show it's a maritime nexus. There's no vessel requirement from almost all of the claims under the Longshore Act. Another point I wish to make is that both the First Circuit and the petitioner talked about a bright line test. The First Circuit, though, test is dealing with actual transportation, the actual use in business of the structure during the time that the person who is claiming special status is associated with it. More confusing is dealing with 1 U.S.C., section 3, which although bright is also very broad and would include everything. Anything that floats or is capable of floating would be included under that. There are always going to be situations, no matter what definition the Court comes up with -- always situations where a person would have to be covered under both acts, and I realize in the Chandris case, it was the goal of the Court to say we'd like to make it clear as we -- we can. We don't want people going in and out of Jones Act status. However, as this Court saw in Gizoni, a perfect example -- in Gizoni, the person was a harbor worker. This Court sent it back to the lower court saying -- the lower court had said you're a harbor worker. That's your label. You're in the harbor workers' union. You're not entitled to -- for Jones Act status. This Court said no, send it back, let's take another look. The person, although a harbor worker, may have had the requisite connections to a vessel in navigation to be able to claim Jones Act seaman status. Obviously, in that situation, which is a perfect example, the -- the employer would have had to cover him under the Longshore Act and if -- if the lower court changes or -- or the jury decides that he's a Jones Act seaman, would have had to have covered him under the Jones Act. Professor Schoenbaum has said that the mutual exclusivity of the two acts is really in theory only and that there are always cases and will be dealing with the brown water seamen and brown water employees, harbor workers and longshoremen, where they're going to have to be covered under both anyway. Again, the First Circuit test, which does have an exception to it, which it clearly is -- is a snapshot, again to give someone another bite at the apple, which this Court thought, at least in the concurring opinion in Chandris, was a fair result, has that. But the test itself is -- is broad. It -- it is a bright line and it makes it clear, as this Court has stated in the past, that unless there's a transportation function, it's not a vessel in navigation. Thank you.

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8511 # FALSE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT #  # We will now hear argument in the case of City against -- Sherrill, New York against the Oneida Indian Nation of New York. Mr. Sacks, whenever you're ready.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8513 # FALSE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: With the Court's permission, the State of New York, as amicus, will address issues related to the Treaty of Buffalo Creek and I will address the other reasons why aboriginal title and other Indian possessory rights to the properties at issue were extinguished long before the Oneida Indian Nation purchased the properties in 1997 and 1998. The asserted basis for tax immunity in this case appears at page 1 of respondent's brief which is that the Oneidas have at all times held a tribal possessory right in the properties. But even if there was a tribal possessory right, aboriginal title or under the Treaty of Canandaigua, in 1805 and 1807 when these properties passed out of tribal hands, the passage of 190 years has extinguished that right. For 190 years, these properties have been in private non-Indian hands, have been freely alienable, have been transferred to innumerable innocent purchasers and have been subject to the full panoply of state and local laws including taxation.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8514 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, is it your position that whenever an Indian transfers land in violation of the Nonintercourse Act, that that's a valid transfer? And if not, why is this different?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8515 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. It is not our position that that would be a valid transfer if there was a violation of the Nonintercourse Act. The principal issue here is whether, after of the passage of 190 years, there remains a possessory right. If there was a violation of a Nonintercourse Act in 1805 and 1807, Justice Kennedy, we believe the Oneida Indian Nation has a -- under this Court's decision in Oneida II -- a federal common law damage suit against New York State or against the United States of America for failing to exercise its fiduciary duty. But after 190 years, in 1997, they did not have a possessory right to these properties. The possessory right we're talking about, aboriginal title or some other tribal possessory right, isn't just a concept. As this Court has defined aboriginal title of those possessory rights, it's a right to current possession. And under this Court's decisions in cases such as Felix versus Patrick and Yankton Sioux, and Williams and Mitchell and Santa Fe, all of which were cited in the dissent written by Justice Stevens, for the, for members of dissent in Oneida II, tribal possessory rights are barred by that passage of time, the change in the character of the land and the innumerable innocent purchasers.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8516 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why does not having a possessory right mean that the city could tax them, or the State?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8517 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The basis for the tax immunity here is that this land does not have Indian country status. For this land to have Indian country status, it has to be, in our view, under this Court's Venetie decision, Federal set-asides and Federal superintendence. If you look at how the Oneida Indian nation got this land in 1997, it wasn't because of any set-aside by the Federal Government in 1794, even if there was, and I will get to that later.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8518 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No, I'm just thinking, that suppose you have a reservation but the tribe doesn't have a possessory right because in the middle of the reservation, there is some kind of long-term lease or a sale to a house that's owned by somebody else who is not a member of the tribe. I would think -- am I right that the city or the county in which that reservation sits can't tax it anyway?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8519 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right. I absolutely agree with you.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8520 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # All right. So if you were to say the tribe does not have a possessory right, they can't go in and eject all the people who are living there and built houses over the last 192 years. That doesn't mean still that you could tax them.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8521 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But your hypothetical, Your Honor, presupposed the existence of the reservation and presupposed a possessory right subject to lease. The possessory right here did not exist because the Oneida Indian nation had no rights with respect to the land at all in 1997. Those rights could not be enforced. And for the right not to be --
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8522 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, they couldn't be enforced against certain innocent purchasers but when the land is reacquired, then it seems to me we have to ask whether there was an extinction of aboriginal title and whether the reservation was at some point subsequently disestablished by federal act. And if we hold against you on the ground that there was no extinction of aboriginal title and there was no disestablishment of the reservation, then it seems to me that when they reacquire, we get to exactly the point that Justice Breyer raises and that is, once they reacquire the land, why does it become taxable? Why does its nontaxable status not simply reassert itself?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8523 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that you have to look at the definition of Indian country. If you look at the definition of Indian country, it requires, with respect to the properties we're talking about, federal set-aside and federal superintendence.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8524 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So you're saying if the original establishment of the reservation was simply a continuation, was literally a reservation from a transfer of land to the State of New York and that the Indian title was a purely aboriginal title, not a title conferred by a federal act creating a reservation, that it cannot be Indian country, is that correct?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8525 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If I understand the question that you asked, Your Honor, if the title came from the State of New York, for example, in the --
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8526 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Let's assume the title is aboriginal. Nothing in an act of the United States says we're giving this land to the Indians, e.g., in the Kansas situation. It's simply aboriginal title and it was never extinguished. Are you saying that if that is the source of the title as opposed to a federal act saying we give this to you, that it cannot be Indian country?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8527 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Your Honor.

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8529 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. In a situation where there was continuing aboriginal title, similar to the Senecas in the State of New York where New York State did not terminate the aboriginal rights of the Senecas, there need not be congressional act, there need not be congressional or treaty action to establish the reservation.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8530 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So this part of your argument depends on our accepting your position on the Treaty of Fort Schuyler as being a conveyance of all property and a later retrocession, is that correct?

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8532 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Because otherwise, I don't see what extinguished the aboriginal title.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8533 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What extinguished the aboriginal title with respect to this aspect of the argument, and then I will move on to the Treaty of Fort Schuyler and the Treaty of Canandaigua. What extinguished the aboriginal title is the passage of time and the fact that this land has been under state and local jurisdiction for 190 years and this Court observed, in Hagen and Rosebud Sioux, and I acknowledge it was in a different context, but this is important, that stable rules of jurisdiction and sovereignty are important in situations like this where what we're dealing with is very few -- 1 percent of the land in the City of Sherrill is owned by the tribe. The land is predominantly non-Indian. And as this Court observed in Hagen and Rosebud Sioux, a finding that the land now comes back into tribal jurisdiction, to paraphrase, seriously disrupts the justifiable expectations of the community and that's not just a hypothetical in this case.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8534 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I know that, but I mean, then it seems to me if one thing that Oneida establishes is that the whole title doesn't just disappear if nothing else happens, simply because of the passage of time.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8535 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think what disappears, Your Honor

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8537 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- is the right to possess.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8538 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Now we agree with that or I'll hypothetically agree with that. They can't come in and eject people. But then I'm back to my first question, because I take it that the refusal in Oneida to the suggestion that they can't go, say, to Buffalo, New York, or wherever, or some town and throw everybody out of the house, that that, of course, does reflect the passage of time. But for a city or State to tax the land, that doesn't involve the same kind of interference with people's expectation of living in the houses that they bought, that throwing someone out of his house would involve.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8539 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Here's what impacts the expectations. What impacts the expectations is the following. I'll give you an example that appears from the joint appendix on the Court of Appeals from pages 1263 to 1277. In the year 2000, the City of Oneida cited two Oneida Indian Nation businesses, a convenience store and a gas station, for 16 fire code violations. The tribe citing this Court's decision in Brendale said, we're not governed by the local fire code. We're governed by tribal jurisdiction. It's more than just the interference, the issue of taxation, the issue of sovereignty is whether a gas station is going to blow up or burn down --
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8540 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It is a matter, is it not, of whether the tribe now has sovereignty over this parcel of land? Is that's what's at the bottom of the question?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8541 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think in terms of the problems for the citizens of the City of Sherrill, taxation is part of it, and sovereignty is part of it, and they go hand in hand.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8542 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If the tribe has sovereign -- sovereignty status with regard to this property, then presumably the city can't tax it. So we have to decide that, do we?

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8544 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # All right. Now what do we do with the Oneida II case decided in 1985?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8545 # TRUE # MR. SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This, the position we're taking here is fully consistent with Oneida II. In Oneida II, this Court held that there was a violation of federal common law principally because of a violation of the Nonintercourse -- Indian Trade and Intercourse Act in 1795. This Court wasn't asked to deal with, at that time, with the Treaty of Fort Schuyler. It wasn't asked to deal with the Treaty of Buffalo Creek. It wasn't presented with evidence of the numerous authorized New York State treaties in 1840 through 1846 that diminished this reservation, that the State of New York will deal with -- with as amicus --

I think that principles of stare decisis still govern and I think what, and this is consistent with the position that we have taken with respect to the passage of time extinguishing the possessory right, is what this Court for stare decisis purposes found in Oneida II was that there was a violation of federal common law with respect to a transfer that was very different than this transfer, without any examination of the Treaty of Buffalo Creek and without any examination of the Treaty of Fort Schuyler.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8548 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But there wouldn't have been a violation of federal law if this were not Indian country, if this were not an Oneida reservation when the transfer occurred.

SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, that might or might not be correct, depending on how one views the scope of the Nonintercourse Act. But if one views the scope of the Nonintercourse Act to apply to Indian reservations, even state reservations, as the Second Circuit in Mohican Tribe has held, then the Treaty of Fort Schuyler could have terminated all aboriginal title; The Treaty of Fort Schuyler could have established a state reservation for the Oneidas; and the Nonintercourse Act of 1790, two years later, could have prohibited the sale of those lands even though it was a state reservation and under state jurisdiction.

SACKS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The tribe has changed its position on that, I believe, in the course of the last 30 years but that is their current position. That it becomes subject to the Nonintercourse Act consistent with their position. With the Court's permission, I want to, I do want turn to the 1788 Treaty of Fort Schuyler and, time permitting, the 1794 Treaty of Canandiagua. Our position on the treaty of Fort Schuyler I think is very plain in our papers and I just want to highlight what's in the rest of the treaty after Article 1, which is a cessionable land. What's in the rest of the treaty is that New York reserved numerous rights even with respect to the reservation's land. New York had, among other things, the right to make and apply laws to the reservation, to enforce the treaty -- and I'm quoting from Article 4 -- in such manner as the State shall deem proper. New York had the right to enforce its criminal laws with respect to intruders on the reservation that New York granted to the Oneidas obtaining the assistance of the Oneidas to do so. New York, in the treaty, prohibited the Oneidas from selling the lands. New York, in the treaty, prohibited the Oneidas from certain length of leases and New York had the right to enact laws with respect to the leases that were permitted to enforce the leases. The other thing that one needs to look at in the context of the times, when looking at how would the Oneidas have understood this, the tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, knew how to preserve their aboriginal title when they wanted to do so and the Oneidas didn't do that. In the 1797 Big Tree agreement with the Senecas which is published at 7 Statutes at Large, 601, the Senecas sold much of their lands through Robert Morris under the approval of the United States. In the agreement, the agreement provided that the reserved lands were, and I quote, "clearly and fully understood to remain the property of the Senecas in as full and ample matter as if these presents had not been executed." That is the way an Indian tribe understood preserving aboriginal title. That didn't happen in the Treaty of Fort Schuyler.

The other thing that one has to look at at the time is what New York State was doing. New York State entered into three similar treaties at the time. One with the Oneidas, one with the Cayuga and one with the Onondaga. Those three treaties all terminated aboriginal title in the first provision.

The other three tribes of the Iroquois were not of concern to New York State in 1788 because the Mohawks had mostly removed to Canada, the Tuscaroras had no land of their own and the Senecas were in the portion of New York State where Massachusetts had the preemption right. So if you look at what is happening back in 1788 and early 1789, New York State is setting up a State treaty with the Oneidas and keeping jurisdiction over those lands. Now, to go back to what you asked earlier, Justice Scalia, no question that if in that context, the Federal Government then passed a statute that says, as it may, the Oneidas can't sell this land without federal approval. That's a violation of the Nonintercourse Act, but it doesn't change the fundamental nature of the land as being under state jurisdiction, and has been under state jurisdiction since 1788.

There is a reference in our papers to a report, it was issued in connection with the New York State setting up their troopers to cover the reservations, and that report acknowledged that the United States Government appreciated the fact that the State of New York had been keeping peace on the reservations with their police and saw no reason to interfere with over 100 years -- and this was in the early 20th century -- of over 100 years of state police supervision.

HALLIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # With regard to the 5,000 acres that they occupied as of 1838, one could read Ransom Gillett's assurances to the Oneidas as allowing them to continue to retain occupancy over that narrow slice of land, but what that cannot do is change the language of the treaty which makes clear that the reservation is otherwise entirely disestablished. And if I can refer to some of the language of the treaty itself, first of all, the treaty explicitly states that its purpose was to carry out the Government's policy in removing the Indians from the east to the west of the Mississippi. That simply cannot be squared with ongoing sovereignty over the remaining 295,000 acres which they now claim --

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8605 # TRUE # MS. HALLIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, then in that case, I suppose I should agree. My apologies. But what they did was to agree to remove, and in fact, that's what happened. If you look at what transpired immediately following the treaty, by 1846, all but 350 acres, down from 5,000, have been sold by the Oneidas and very few remain. By 1920, there are only 32 acres. And the U.S.'s activities in the area also confirm that that was the understanding of the treaty, that it terminated sovereignty. There are some very sparse references in the records to some exercise of jurisdiction by the U.S. starting around the turn of the century, around the early 1900s, but those only relate to the 32 acres that remained occupied by the Oneidas. There is no indication of any exercise of U.S. jurisdiction over the remaining 295,000 acres.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8606 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I thought that perhaps the Treaty of Buffalo Creek is thinking of 50,000 acres where these particular Indian tribe members had their homes, or at least arguably. Just no one was thinking about the remaining 300,000 because they had long left those. It had nothing to do with them.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8607 # TRUE # MS. HALLIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I believe the text and the historical background suggests otherwise, Your Honor. Article 4 of the treaty says that the Kansas lands will be the new homes of the Oneidas and it also explains where the Oneidas can exercise sovereignty. It says that it will secure to the Oneidas in the Kansas lands, in said country, which refers to the Kansas lands, the right to establish their own form of government, to appoint their own officers and to administer their own laws. That means that sovereignty is to be in Kansas, not to be in New York.

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8614 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Doesn't that negate your argument that the treaty as such disestablished the reservation?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8615 # TRUE # MS. HALLIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Your Honor, it doesn't. The treaty on its terms appears to disestablish the reservation entirely. Gillett's statement could perhaps be read as a subsequent gloss on that treaty to assure the Indians that they won't be forced off their land, the 5,000 acres that they continue to occupy, perhaps because since New York was not a party to the treaty, there couldn't be any explicit session language in the treaty. New York was the only entity that had a right to buy that remaining 5,000 acres because it held the right of preemption. So it may have been that the Oneidas wanted to ensure that they could reach reasonable terms. And they did. They sold almost all of that land within the following six years after proclamation of the treaty. So the contemporaneous history squares with that. It's very similar to what happened in Santa Fe, in which this Court said there was a reservation that was created for the Santa Fes, there was some indication of acceptance of that reservation, and that acceptance was sufficient to terminate the tribe's sovereignty over any lands outside of the reservation that was provided to them, even though many of them did not in fact remove to that land. Here the Oneidas received much more. Not only did many of them sell the lands and leave immediately but they received the benefit of their bargain by recovering compensation for the Kansas lands from this Court in New York Indians.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8616 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # What is the precise language that you think relinquished, changed the sovereignty that -- changed the sovereignty?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8617 # TRUE # MS. HALLIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think there are several provisions, Your Honor. First of all, in the recitals, it states that the purpose of the treaty is to carry out the Government's policy in removing the Indians from the east to the west of the Mississippi. Article 2 also notes that the Kansas lands will be a permanent home for all Indians now residing in the State of New York as well as elsewhere, and Article 4 states that there will be an exercise of sovereignty. It says specifically that will they will be able to establish their own form of government, appoint their officers and administer their laws in the Kansas land specifically. So I think those are the strongest provisions. I would also like to touch for a moment if I can on a question that several members of the Court have raised which is what is the impact of this decision here. From the perspective of the State of New York and the localities, it's very serious because it does concern whether or not the tribe can unilaterally regain sovereignty over a very large tract of land in central New York. This is an area that has been --
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8618 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, there are implications from Oneida II case that the Indians can reacquire land and assert some kind of possessory right.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8619 # TRUE # MS. HALLIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # With regard to a narrower swath of land than what's at issue here. And in any event, the Court expressly did not pronounce on the effect of the Buffalo Creek treaty here. If that's the case, what could well result is a patchwork quilt of jurisdiction which this Court has said poses tremendous governance problems. It's governance by tract book. This is not just hypothetical. There are already difficulties that have started to arise as a result of the Second Circuit's decision. For example, another tribe relying on the decision here purchased land within its original land claim area that's just 300 yards from a local high school and have begun operation of a gaming hall there. The locality attempted to enjoin operation of the gaming hall, but was unable to do so in light of the Second Circuit's decision below. We anticipate there are will be many other problems of that sort that will arise. The residents of the area here have long settled and justifiable expectations. The settlement patterns are clear here. The absence of any exercise of U.S. jurisdiction outside a very small plot of land is not controverted. These are factors that this Court has repeatedly held in cases like Hagen and Yankton Sioux are relevant to the question of both what the contemporaneous understanding of the treaty was and what the result should be today, and we submit that they should lead to the same result here as well. If there are no further questions --

SMITH # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: There was a suggestion in answer to an earlier question that the Oneidas have changed their position about whether the land is alienable when in their hands. That's not correct. There is nothing in the record to suggest that. What the record does suggest at page 213 of the joint appendix is that Sherrill has changed its position. It wanted an easement on Oneida land in 1997 and at that page of the appendix, you will see that Sherrill went to the Department of the Interior for Federal approval of the easement under Federal law, understanding at the time the Oneida's position and the Federal law principle that the land wasn't subject even to an easement absent the Secretary's approval.

And the land, when the Oneida's possession of the land, actual possession is unified with their underlying Federal property and treaty rights, the land is inalienable and cannot be sold today out of the Oneida's possession any more than it could 200 years ago.

We are not waiving any of the underlying rights that involve right to possession under Federal law and aboriginal rights and the point I'm making should not be construed that way.

You don't evict the people who are there but it's 22 square miles in the center of New York State. That's a lot of land. And maybe that's worth a trillion dollars, I don't know. So does that mean that the Indian tribe would have -- would it mean that it had the right to, let's say, hundreds of billions of dollars, the value of that property, that it could sue someone for it, the State of New York or the Federal Government?

This is just a terrible situation as far as governance is concerned and part of the blame for the situation we're in is that the Oneidas did not complain about this for 170 years.

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8658 # TRUE # MR. SMITH # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # In the Cayuga case, there were two elements of damages. One was retrospective, and that was rental damages for past trespass. The other was a current value, because Judge McKern said that he would not evict anyone, and that he thought a suitable alternative to eviction was the award of value, because it would put the tribe in a position through a free-market and voluntary relationship with purchasers to, quote, "restore its homeland." Judge McKern got really to the heart of this process by recognizing that there are inequities all around, if you will, and that the Court is without the power to extinguish the underlying rights. It's Congress's role, but that there needs to be a sensible way of recognizing those rights today. And what Judge McKern decided is that damages would put the tribe in a position to do what the Oneidas have done with respect to the land that's at issue here before the Court, and that's to make, you know, a fair-and-square deal and pay full value.

And even though a person says, "You can live here as long as you want," that just means they can live there as long as they want; that doesn't mean it's the reservation. The reservation's sovereignty may have gone to Kansas, though, of course, nobody had to move, unless he struck a fair bargain that he agreed to with the State of New York. I take it that's their argument. I just want to hear your response.

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8668 # TRUE # MR. SMITH # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That argument rests on the idea that there was an assumption, at the time of the Treaty of Buffalo Creek, that the prior transfers were valid. It's an argument of ratification by assumption. Oneida II says, in a much more forceful circumstance, that even a later Federal treaty that explicitly refers to the prior session does not ratify it, because the ratifying language has to be clear and express, and you have to believe that both the Indians and the Congress, the United States, meant to do that. Here, the -- if you think about it, in what I just heard concerning Buffalo Creek, there's an interesting asymmetry. We're supposed to assume that the treaty covered all the land, but we're not supposed to conclude that Ransom Gillet's promises covered it all. We're supposed to believe that one, by assumption, extends to the entire reservation and that the other, forceful promises of a Federal treaty commissioner that you need not go anywhere, are actually very limited and carried with them a thought that they were extinguishing rights in other land. That interaction with Ransom Gillet is crucial. The treaty --

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8670 # TRUE # MR. SMITH # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The representations from the Federal treaty commissioner were not that they could buy it back. The Federal treaty commissioner went to the Oneidas because they would not agree to the treaty. They didn't want to give up their rights. He gave them a piece of paper that was meant to assure them they were not giving up their rights. There was no suggestion in this important interaction that they were bargaining over the loss of other rights. Mille Lacs is directly in point here. Mille Lacs, I think -- well, from Mille Lacs, you can derive the proposition that where the record shows no bargaining over a right, and where the treaty does not refer to the right, the Indians will not be held to have silently yielded their important rights. In the nature of this interaction, you have the suggestion that -- you have a far more important right, in much larger part of the reservation, that persisted as a matter of Federal law. There is nothing about what happened at Buffalo Creek that would suggest that anyone would think they were affecting the Oneida's rights in lands that were not involved in the treaty. Now, the treaty --

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8673 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- between New York State and the Oneidas. Now, that contained language which said the Oneidas cede and grant all their lands to the people of the State of New York. That was the operative provision. Later on, it -- Article 2 says, "Of the ceded lands" -- the ceded lands, lands that have been ceded -- "a tract described by metes and bounds is reserved to the Oneidas to hold to themselves and their posterity forever." Now, I would normally interpret that to mean that the Oneidas gave up all of their sovereignty over the lands and were given back, by the State of New York, the right over this tract designated by metes and bounds. Now, I'm saying I would normally interpret that, except in a treaty with the Indians. In a treaty with the Indians, you say, "Well" -- and we have cases which have language somewhat like this, and they say, "Well, they really didn't cede the part that they reserved." That may be the case in -- ordinarily. But it seems to me, a basic principle of contract law -- of treaty law, of any law -- that where there is an ambiguous phrase or provision, you interpret it the way the parties themselves have interpreted it. And it seems to me that the subsequent history, after 1788, indicates that the Oneidas believed that New York State had jurisdiction over that land.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8674 # TRUE # MR. SMITH # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Actually --
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8675 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The New York State police were in there. New York State managed the lands.
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8676 # TRUE # MR. SMITH # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Scalia, actually, it's interesting. In the Joint Appendix in the Court of Appeals, at page 413, is the actual document that governed the transfer of this land, the state statute; and in that statute, the State granted its right of preemption to an individual to acquire the land, because it understood that it had not yet exercised its right of preemption. That's, in the conduct of the parties, a direct refutation of the idea that the right of preemption was exercised in the Treaty of Buffalo -- in the Treaty of Fort Schuyler, the 1788 treaty. The most fundamental point, though, about the 1788 treaty is that next came the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, which embodied a Federal promise to protect the free use and enjoyment of this land, and the Oneidas' possession of it. And that exact promise -- not sort of, like, but exact -- was held in New York Indians I to prevent taxation of the Senecas' lands. Now, I guess I'd like to make two quick points before I'm out of time. One is that, with respect to the idea that it's just too late, apart from the fact that the question is not presented, I want to emphasize that, in section 2415 of Title 28, Congress explicitly focused on the question of these old claims. And if you read the legislative history, all they talked about was how to deal with the Oneida claim and these old claims. And they not only provided that title claims are not barred by statute of limitations, and established a limitations period that would not have run against the Oneidas because they were on a Federal list, but they did the following, which I think is notable. The statute provides that these claims accrued, in 1966, on the day of the statute, there is no room for background equitable principles in Federal law. Where Congress has specifically focused on a problem, addressed it, the idea is, I suppose, that there is no room to fill gaps here by the Court where Congress has decided just what the gaps are and how to fill them. The other point that I would make concerns the Treaty of Buffalo Creek. The treaty's language leaves it to both sides to decide whether or not Indians are going to Kansas. The legislate -- the history of the treaty shows that the United States backed away from any language which would oblige it to remove Indians, and the language with respect to the Indians left them a choice. But, ultimately, all of that is controlled by what happened. The Federal Government made a decision that no Indians would go to Kansas. The idea that Buffalo Creek extinguished reservations in New York would seem bizarre to anyone in New York today, because the Onondagas have reservations, the Senecas have reservations, the St. Regis have reservations, the Tonawandas have reservations, the Tuscaroras have reservations, and the Oneidas have reservations. It didn't extinguish just the -- there's an idea that you can look at this in a vacuum -- it didn't just extinguish the Oneida reservations. Under the Santa Fe rationale, the point is not that Congress ultimately intended two reservations, although it has done that often -- the Choctaw, the Mississippi Choctaw, the Seminoles. It frequently happened with removal, that there were more than one reservations. But here, you would have to believe that Congress intended no reservation. You would have to believe that Congress quickly came to the decision that none of these Indian tribes in New York actually had a reservation anywhere, and that's not acceptable. Thank you.

STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I would like to address, first, the City's argument that the long passage of time renders it improper to give the tribe a tax exemption on lands that have recently been purchased. That argument is wrong for three reasons. First, if we are correct that the tribe had federally protected title as of the 1790s and that that Federal protection was never validly extinguished, then the fact that the tribe was out of possession of the relevant lands for nearly two centuries is, itself, a distinct and substantial legal wrong, and it would be adding insult to injury to say that precisely because the tribe had suffered that initial injury, it should be disentitled to take advantage of a tax exemption that would otherwise flow from its possession of --

And what difference does it make what the nature of the wrong is, whether it's dispossession or not?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8681 # TRUE # MR. STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think it -- I think it's important to distinguish between two different types of delay. What was at issue in Oneida I and Oneida II was delay in bringing the underlying lawsuit. And, even in that context, the Court said that the suit was not barred entirely, but equitable factors might be taken into account in formulating an appropriate remedy. Here, we don't have delay in filing a lawsuit. That is, nobody doubts that the tribes asserted their right to a tax exemption promptly after repurchasing the relevant lands. The argument on the other side is that their delay in purchasing the land should be analogized to --

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8689 # TRUE # MR. STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think the -- the reservation would remain a reservation. As Mr. Smith pointed out, with respect to parcels within the reservation that are not owned by Indians, the tribe's regulatory authority is extremely limited and, therefore, the tribe would not be able to exercise anything like plenary regulatory jurisdiction over the whole 270,000 acres.

In -- and Atkinson Trading makes clear that, even when the great bulk of the land is owned by the tribe or its members, the tribe's ability to regulate conduct on the non-Indian parcels is sharply limited. That would be doubly true in a tract of this nature. But to return to the point about the State's reliance interest, I think it's -- or the city's reliance interest -- I think it's important to stress that this case is only about taxation, and a municipality can't claim to have the same sort of reliance interest in being able to tax that a potential defendant in a --

When you add that to the value of the land, I'm thinking of numbers that are astronomical. And yet that hasn't happened. And so, what actually, as a -- and that's why I'm thinking, isn't a damage action far more serious than simply taking property off the tax rolls?

argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8698 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, Congress has done nothing about this, has it? Can -- has the tribe asked, administratively, for the Bureau of Indians Affairs to recognize it now as a tribe?
argument in the case of City against # 03-855 # 8699 # TRUE # MR. STEWART # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has recognized the tribe all along. That is, under the Treaty of Canandaigua, the Federal Government was required to pay annuities and treaty cloth to the Six Nations, and the Federal Government has done that continuously since the beginning. So we've always recognized this to be a tribe. And I think you're -- you've put your finger on an important point, Justice Breyer, in that the Court, in Oneida II, said that it hoped that Congress would fix the problem, and thought that it would, but said even if Congress doesn't legislate a solution, the suit can go forward. The Court contemplated that equitable considerations could be taken into account in formulating a remedy, but it certainly didn't contemplate that the tribe, at the end of the day, would be left without any remedy at all. And, as you point out, if the tribe can sue for damages, it seems farfetched to think that it wouldn't be able to reassert the tax immunity that --

But I agree that holding this parcel to be a reservation would have implications for regulatory jurisdiction, as well. Now, there isn't a categorical rule of Federal law that says that States and localities absolutely cannot regulate conduct on tribal lands within the reservation. Rather, there is a preemption test -- there's certainly a thumb on the scale in favor of an exemption from state and local regulation where tribal reservation lands are involved.

And the Court looked to Article 3 of the treaty to determine the conditions for forfeiture. It said that the Federal Government would have been required to allege a forfeiture by legislative or judicial act, et cetera. The other thing I really wanted to -- the point I wanted to make about the reliance interest of the taxing jurisdiction are that no matter how long a particular tract has been taxable, it is -- may I finish this? -- it is always within the realm of a city's contemplation that it may be bought up tomorrow by the Federal Government, a church, any other tax-exempt entity, and, consequently, the municipality can have no sense of repose that it will remain taxable.

And if you say that that's different, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court of Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial matter.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8734 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, to answer the first question, I think that if -- if such a statute were enacted, I'm willing to grant, for purposes of this case, that it wouldn't be a double jeopardy problem. It may in a later case -- and you know, I'd be very interested in that -- a problem under a combination of Jackson and Winship because the defendant may have a -- a right to that determination.

What I thought from reading your brief, which you're confirming, is your rule -- once the judge says acquittal, that's the end of it. If he decides 3 seconds later, he cannot change his mind.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8795 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor. There -- there was a defense that he essentially forfeited by not being aware that the judge was going to, at some point --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8796 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But that was a terribly risky defense because his main defense is I wasn't there, I didn't do it, somebody else did it. How could he then turn around and say I missed the opportunity to tell the jury I really was there, but it was okay for me to have the gun? I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do that after having spent his whole effort to say it was the other guy, it wasn't this defendant? And then to make this defense that he had a right to possess this gun because he belonged in the house, that would be extraordinary.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8797 # TRUE # MR.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8799 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But what I'm saying is --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8800 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That's -- look, there were a lot of charges in this case, and we're dealing with what is a relatively lesser offense of this whole string of events so that Brown being acquitted of other offenses doesn't say anything about this offense, which relates to the possession of a gun. That's -- that's all that it is.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8801 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What I'm saying is that it wasn't risky, Your Honor, because the -- this jury was willing to consider an alternative defense that would have otherwise appeared as a concession. They did not take it as a concession.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8802 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But he would be -- the defendant -- you know, he hasn't gone to the jury yet, and the jury would say, my goodness, this is like a common law pleader. I didn't borrow the kettle. It was broken when I got it. Or, I returned it unbroken. To -- to do that, to say I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then, jury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that I was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a criminal defense.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8803 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'd just respectfully disagree, Your Honor. But -- but the -- the larger point is if we allow this rule in general, we are going to engender serious problems. I'm saying that there -- that there was some reliance here, but we're going to engender much more serious problems in other cases where a defendant perhaps presents a defense that is helpful to the remaining charges, but damaging on the acquitted charge.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8804 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, but if -- if -- you know, we shape the expectation by what we say. If -- if we say that a judge is always free to consider his ruling and as long as the -- there's a right to reopen, then any kind of reliance is -- is misplaced.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8805 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What Massachusetts law says in -- in the Zavala case, they said that there is not a right to reopen where the judge has determined that the evidence is insufficient. Second of all --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8806 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That is when the case is not ongoing. I mean, here we had a case that was continuing and -- and the judge said, oops, I made a mistake, which is common at the trial level. I mean, these decisions -- she made this decision in a split second. Maybe she was too hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk went to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so of course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't prejudice. The defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it came up at closing. Right? So if the defendant was prejudice, anyway he could have said, wait a minute, judge, I want to put on that defense that I really was there but I had a right to have the gun.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8807 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # He didn't say that, Your Honor.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8808 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But he could have. So he -- so I don't see that you have a realistic claim of prejudice.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8809 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I -- I don't think prejudice is a factor in double jeopardy jurisprudence. Either the defendant has been placed twice in jeopardy or he has not.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8810 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes, but you have to set a -- a point in time, and your point is -- well, it's not exactly clear, but there's one point that says when the jury is discharged. Then there may be other reasons why there's unfairness to the defendant so that you wouldn't permit it, other than double jeopardy. But if -- why isn't that a sensible place to draw the line?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8811 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because if -- if discharge of the jury is the rule, then the judge can reconsider an acquittal at any point in a defendant's case. 2 weeks into a defense case, the judge could reconsider an acquittal.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8812 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # The question -- we're talking about a Federal constitutional rule, and suppose -- you pointed out this went only to an intermediate appellate court. Suppose the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court interpreted its rule at 25(a) and it says, that rule allows some leeway for the judge to say I got it wrong as long as there's no prejudice to the defense. That's what our rule means.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8813 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I don't think that's permissible, Your Honor. It -- it is -- granted, for purposes of this argument, that it's permissible for States to order judges to withhold rulings, that there shall be no ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence prior to the return of a jury verdict. Louisiana, for example, does that, and I think Oklahoma. But for the Supreme Judicial -- Judicial Court of Massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is simply straight contravening what this Court has said. It's -- it's essentially a continuing jeopardy argument.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8814 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But you do agree, I take it, that if the judge says, yes, I agree with you, there isn't a scintilla of evidence, and -- and at some point I'm -- I'm going to enter an acquittal, but I'm not going to do it now just in case I have a second thought, but at least by the -- the end of the trial, I'll take care of it, you, I take it, concede that that is permissible.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8815 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that is permissible because --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8816 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, if that -- if that's permissible, if you win this case, isn't that going to be the way trials are conducted when -- when there are mid-trial motions like yours? Every judge is going to say, yes, looks as though you -- you got them there, but I'll -- I'll just hold onto this until things are over, and then I'll rule. That's -- that's the way they're all going to respond, isn't it?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8817 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, I don't think so, Your Honor. I think judges are -- are intelligent people. They read the pleadings beforehand. Justice Donovan clearly read the pleading beforehand in this case, and she -- she was prepared to ask for argument on it. I don't think that judges do these things so precipitously that they are not going to be confident in their ruling.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8818 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No, but every judge knows he drops a catch once in a while, and -- and if he wants to guard against wrecking the whole trial or -- or creating an appellate issue later, he's just going to be cautious and hold onto it.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8819 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And judges should be cautious, Your Honor.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8820 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But isn't it also important to know, though, whether the defendant has to put on a case or not?

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8821 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That -- that is, in fact, the point, Justice Stevens.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8840 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There is a practical effect.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8841 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # What is it?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8842 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Firearm possession offenses in Massachusetts have restrictions as to parole and good time deductions that the other offenses do not have. So there is a practical effect, aside from the fact that it's a -- it's a conviction on his record, Your Honor. Moving on, Justice Breyer, just to address the question that you were asking me, I think perhaps a good way to phrase it is -- is if the first factual resolution of the elements of -- of the offense results in acquittal, there can be no further proceedings.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8843 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What I was thinking is -- I mean, here a judge -- I guess she was harried in the trial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, is there any evidence here that this was less than the shotgun -- this was not a shotgun. You know, it had to be a barrel less than 16 inches. So is there any evidence here of the shotgun? And she, I guess, forgot that there was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. Now, there aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. So she's thinking, something may be missing here. She's a little uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there was all that evidence about the pistol. So I shouldn't have done that. I mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a hypothetical -- what's she supposed to do? Is she supposed to say, I better not enter anything, because after all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a case? Or is she supposed to enter something and think, well, I could change my mind before it's over? Or what is she supposed to do? She just thinks she made a mistake.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8844 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # So your hypothetical is that there's evidence of two guns?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8845 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I thought here there was evidence there was a pistol, but maybe I'm wrong.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8846 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm sorry. Yes, in this case --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8847 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # There was evidence it was a pistol. So I -- I would have thought, reading this, that there was evidence. That's beside the point, but I'm -- I'm just using it as an example where a judge might think she made a mistake. She thought there was no evidence that it wasn't a shotgun, and I guess she forgot that there was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a shotgun.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8848 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # She -- she clearly didn't forget. The prosecutor said to her the evidence was testified to that it was a pistol, it was a revolver, it was a .32 --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8849 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, I'm quite sure -- not quite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence it wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason. And now a few minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is, it couldn't have been that good. Or maybe she thinks that that's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now. What's the line? Suppose she thinks of it a second from now. Suppose she thinks the instant she writes acquittal, she thought, oh, my God, a pistol is not a shotgun. Of course, it isn't. I know that. I better change it. Is it a second from now? Is it she can never change it no matter what once the pen leaves the paper? What's your rule?

Too bad. Right? I mean, we say double jeopardy.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8860 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Correct, Your Honor. That's what --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8861 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Excellent. That was an excellent answer. (Laughter.)
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8862 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Now, I would like to know, given that answer, why is this final under State procedure because it seems as if the State courts of Massachusetts have said, no, it is not a constitutional error to go and look into this again.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8866 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Suppose I took Justice Scalia's rule and I said, that's the rule. Now, I would say that's the rule of a Federal law. Very well. That turns on your decision here being final as a matter of State law, but it seems to me we have State courts here saying, at least for double jeopardy purposes, it isn't final as a matter of State law. And therefore, I want to know how we reach your conclusion here.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8867 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there's -- there clearly is a line beyond which the State cannot go, and that's what Justice Brennan was talking about in his concurrence in Lydon. He said the -- the State cannot fashion a procedure whereby the judge never discharges the jury, and in -- in Kepner, this Court held that the Philippine procedure of withholding finality from an acquittal in a bench trial also violated the Constitution. So State procedure does not control. It is sufficient but not necessary. If -- if you comply with State procedure to say this is -- this is an acquittal, okay, it's an acquittal. If you do not comply with State procedure, it can still be an acquittal under Federal law.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8868 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Does the State have the power to say whether -- whether an acquittal under State law constitutes an acquittal for purposes of Federal constitutional double jeopardy purposes?

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8871 # TRUE # MR. NATHANSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- this Court said that in Smalis quite clearly. If I -- if I may, two things and then I'd like to reserve. But the -- the State would have this Court draw a distinction between acquittals by a judge and acquittals by a jury. That simply has been rejected by this Court numerous times. Sanabria, Rumsey. An acquittal is an acquittal. Again, the -- the State would have this Court draw distinctions between acquittals based on law and acquittals based on fact. Sanabria unequivocally rejected that. Sanabria says that in fact sufficiency of the evidence is not a legal defense. An acquittal is an acquittal. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8874 # FALSE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with where the Court left off on the notion of reconsideration and finality. The Massachusetts Appeals Court here specifically stated that a judge's right to reconsider his or her legal rulings is firmly rooted in the common law and permitted Judge Donovan in this case to reconsider her legal ruling that the evidence was insufficient. Certainly that common law right of reconsideration could not run afoul of this Court's double jeopardy jurisprudence, but the appeals court specifically stated that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated because there was no second proceeding and that the judge in this case, therefore, was permitted to reconsider her ruling.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8876 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Not so long as the jury was still there. If the prosecutor had the opportunity to say, Judge Donovan, give me 10 minutes, I know there's a Supreme Judicial Court case on the point that I'm arguing to you, which is that you did not need a witness to directly testify that the gun barrel length was less than 16 inches, I know there's a case, give me 10 minutes, take a recess, and if the judge agreed to do that and the prosecutor came back and gave the case to the judge and the judge said, absolutely, you're -- you're correct, I'm going to send the charge to the jury, there's no double jeopardy violation there.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8878 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # A bench trial is a very difficult situation. And the Smalis case certainly seems to be the hardest case here, but bench trials present different -- a different situation because the judge is both the fact-finder and the law-giver. And in that context, it's much more difficult --

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8880 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # My answer to that is I believe that if the judge stated the evidence is insufficient, as -- as the judge did in Smalis, as the trier of fact and law, I find the evidence --

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8893 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But is that necessary? I -- I mean, that's what I think is the difficult question here. Can you say that it's final for purposes of the decision-maker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court, but it's not final in respect to the judge having a right to change his mind within the court? That -- that makes a lot of sense to me, but I don't know if it's possible to get there. Why not? I -- I think, well, the reason is that you want judges to be able to reconsider things and you don't have that problem when you're talking about an appeal.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8894 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is --

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8898 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think there are a number of ways to reconcile it. Certainly Massachusetts' position is that it's the difference between a bench trial and a jury trial, but there is also no doubt that the case left the trial court and went up on appeal. I think both of those factors are significant.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8899 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, but isn't -- isn't the significance supposedly the existence or nonexistence of our continuation of the jury panel, going back to Justice Stevens' question? And what if the -- what if the State had a procedure whereby the trial judge would simply decline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal were taken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tipped over, it could come right back to the same jury panel? Would -- would the -- would the answer have to be different?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8900 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think it would.

NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think -- I think for a -- I think for my -- to my way of thinking about the cases, the jury is what matters and it's the defendant's right to his particular tribunal, and that's the first jury that's empaneled --

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8907 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Wow. It goes all the way up on appeal and the jury -- I -- I don't know what the -- I guess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or while the appeal is pending and then when the decision is overturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and recommences the trial? Wow.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8908 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All right. If that's so, then why shouldn't Smalis have gone the other way? Because they can send it right back to exactly the same judge.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8909 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Because he -- he is the trier of fact, and I think at that point --

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8912 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I mean, on the hypothesis before, you're saying if they don't discharge the jury and it can go back to them, no double jeopardy problem.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8913 # TRUE # MS.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8950 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So this a problem created by the judge's dismissal, and which this defendant had every reason to rely upon as being the end of that part of the case. I'm inclined to say if -- if that is a problem, in fairness it's a -- it's a double jeopardy problem, not a due process problem.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8951 # TRUE # MS. NEAVES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, with respect, Justice Scalia, I would say it is the sort of reliance that a -- that a defendant may have, as for example the case in Sanabria, where a -- where a judge excludes certain evidence, and the case goes forward. And as a result of that -- a result of that decision, the judge in that case granted a motion for acquittal. And at the end of the case, the prosecution asked for reconsideration of the exclusion of the evidence, and the judge ultimately determined not to go ahead and let that evidence back in, but specifically said if I had let it back in, I would have vacated my motion for required finding and allowed the case to go to the jury. So that sort of prejudice -- a defendant has an expectation of certain things that may or may not happen at trial, but the remedy outside of the double jeopardy context, if the defendant is acquitted, is a retrial. The drastic remedy of double jeopardy is -- is used when a defendant has been subjected twice to a trial before a second trier of fact. This -- this Court has been consistent that when the government subjects the defendant over and over again before a second --

And -- and if I could just highlight a couple of points to -- to demonstrate the significance of -- of permitting trial judges the ability to reconsider legal rulings. In Massachusetts, the fact that there's a written motion here is quite unusual. These motions are made orally generally. The prosecution is not given an opportunity -- does not -- there's no requirement that he be given advance notice ever. There's no requirement of that. The prosecution argues in opposition to the motion on the spot, and the judge rules on the spot. And -- and I think that -- that procedure is demonstrated quite clearly here. The -- the defendant filed the motion. The prosecution did, indeed, argue the correct response, legal response, did not have a case at hand and as --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8968 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Your position would be the same if the -- if the Massachusetts law provided that the motions at the end of the prosecution's case shall not be ruled on unless -- after they're written briefs filed by both sides and they have 3 days of argument.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8970 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And in fact, the -- the quick and dirty procedure you describe is probably a boon to prosecutors because a judge is -- is not likely to take the serious step of dismissing a charge on the basis of -- of such a procedure and is more likely to say, well, we'll let the trial go ahead and see what the evidence discloses. I mean, I can't imagine that this is not a boon to the prosecutor rather than, as you -- as you seem to paint it here, a disadvantage.

And then after hearing B and C's defense, the judge said, I think I was wrong about acquitting A, so I'm -- I'm going to withdraw it.

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8994 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. We -- we think that the Court's holding in Smalis applies equally to jury trials and to bench trials such that an appeal, an interlocutory appeal, in the midst of a jury trial would not be permissible. But we also think that there is a sound basis for drawing a distinction between --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8995 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But my question is assuming a State procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was permissible, you -- you would say Double Jeopardy Clause would bar that appeal.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8996 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right, because we read that to be the holding of Smalis. But we think there's a basis for distinguishing between appeals on one hand and continuing proceedings before the initial tribunal on the other hand. First of all, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v. Brady where it initially said that the two-stage system of adjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that case was permissible because it entailed continued proceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an appeal to a second tribunal. And the Court specifically distinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United States and Kepner, both of which involved appellate review. And the other basis for drawing a distinction between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the trial court on the other is historical tradition. I think the Court could look to history and history would show that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of justice require trial courts to have the authority to revisit their mid-trial rulings.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8997 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Would -- would you allow a trial judge to reopen -- to -- to permit the prosecution to reopen the case?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8998 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We would, Justice Kennedy, but it raises a distinct problem because one value that's served by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its evidentiary case by repeated efforts. And if the trial judge were permitted to reopen the case to give the prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate that interest. Now, we still think that the proper line is jury discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would present a distinct interest. Now, with respect to historical tradition on appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the government has lacked authority at common law to take an appeal in a criminal proceeding. This Court relied on that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v. the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite narrowly. And so I think the Court could draw a distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court and appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the Court often looks at history to shape the contours of double jeopardy protections. And that would afford the case -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court reconsideration should be permitted. And I think the lens through which the Court would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal, because the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't exclude reconsiderations.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 8999 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why -- why doesn't the -- the prosecution gets its full and fair opportunity if we have a rule that says to trial judges, when you make a ruling on acquittal, you better be serious and you better not make a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've done it, it sticks? Why -- why doesn't the prosecution have a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule? Everybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are going to be careful.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9000 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Souter, we think a constitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness of a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects. First, the line between a definitive ruling and a tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've outlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a variety of factual scenarios that come from real cases where trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on a motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that ruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which page of the transcript you happen to be looking at. But even if we're dealing with a situation in which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively but still be incorrect. Trial courts make mistakes. That's why this issue comes up as often as it does. For example, in this case --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9001 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All these cases -- we've had several, not too many over the -- the whole line of cases -- and the trial judge has always committed a rather plain error. And we all have the case where if you just try to decide whether it's a just result, you'd always say no. A case just like this. The judge made a mistake, but we've always said that's not something we -- we look at.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9002 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't -- I'm not quite sure I'm following what you're saying, Justice Stevens, because --
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9003 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I say as a typical matter these double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which the judge made a rather plain error, and when you look at it later, you say, gee, he goofed. And so I'm not sure we should consider the plainness of the error or the fact that they -- they do mistakes because they do.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9004 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But -- but I don't -- but the reason why the Court accepts errors in some situations is because there's some other value under the Double Jeopardy Clause.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9005 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The value of finality is what is really at stake here.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9006 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it's not just the value of finality. It's that, for example, if the judge makes an error and then the jury is discharged, it's the value that the defendant has in obtaining a result from the particular tribunal. In the circumstances of this case, where the trial judge can correct her error within the -- within a matter of minutes, at least in some situations, there would be no double jeopardy purpose served --

argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9010 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. I acknowledge in this case it wasn't, but it might well be in some cases. For example, we cite a decision of the Washington Supreme Court, State v. Collins, which involves essentially the same scenario as this case, but the only distinction was that after the trial judge initially announced her ruling, the prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a span of 10 minutes, the trial judge was able to realize her error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the charge.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9011 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Does it matter if the -- if the ruling is conveyed to the jury even though the jury isn't discharged?

SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It would matter, Justice O'Connor, but I don't think it would necessarily preclude the prosecution from going forward on the charge under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The question would be one of due process and prejudice to the defendant.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9013 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # You had three -- three reasons you were going to give Justice Souter. One is it's not clear always that it's definitive. The other is that trial judges do make mistakes, and the third is?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9014 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And the third is -- it's an issue that you raised earlier, Justice Kennedy. It's that this case might look different as an atmospheric matter if the trial judge at the time she rendered her ruling had said, I'm ruling in the defendant's favor, but I may reconsider this decision at a later point in the proceedings. Now, that might be seen to fall on the tentative side of the line, but that's exactly the effect of this -- of the trial judge's ruling as a matter of Massachusetts law. And we don't think there's a constitutionally significant distinction between a trial judge explicitly saying that a ruling can be reconsidered and State law saying that the ruling can be reconsidered.
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9015 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why isn't the distinction the right to rely?
argument in the case of Smith against Massachusetts # 03-8661 # 9016 # TRUE # MR. SRINIVASAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It -- there -- there -- that would be the basis of a claim, Justice Souter, but the right to rely is, in essence, a notice prejudice sort of claim and that could be handled in the way that trial courts typically handle claims by the defendant that they've detrimentally relied on an initial ruling the trial court has subsequently reconsidered. It would be equally the case, for example, as the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling. The question would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had detrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial determination. And we don't think that prejudice inquiry is meaningfully different when you're dealing with evidentiary rulings as when you're -- as when you're dealing with the reinstatement of a previously acquitted charge.

The argument about inherent authority to reconsider an acquittal really has it backwards. Inherent authority bends to the Constitution. The Constitution does not bend to a judge's inherent authority. Second, the -- the Government is trying to substitute a standard here of a second proceeding, which is not this Court's standard. This Court's standard is further proceedings after an acquittal, including resumption of the same trial. That's what this Court said in Smalis. The Government is also trying to move this case into the particular tribunal analysis. That comes from cases that are mistrials. This is an acquittal. This is not a particular tribunal case. As to the judge resolving all the issues in a bench trial and -- and that's why that -- that acquittal would be more final than a motion for a directed verdict, it was a motion for a directed verdict. It was a demurrer in Smalis. It was the exact same standard that the judge applied in that case. As to prejudice, prejudice has never been a factor in this Court's double jeopardy analysis. As a matter of fact, in -- in one of the really classical statements, Ex parte Lange, if you look at the facts of that case, that looks like complete gamesmanship. The defendant was sentenced to a jail term and a fine when the -- the statute only authorized a jail term or a fine. He said, oh, I'll pay -- I'll pay the fine. It's a get-out-of-jail-free card. There's complete gamesmanship, but prejudice was not a factor. And in fact, this Court has said prejudice is not open to judicial examination in double jeopardy cases. As to honing, in -- in fact, in Rumsey --

But whether or not the Government has honed its cased through -- and -- and they would say evidentiary honing. But it's not evidentiary honing. In Rumsey, it was only argument that was presented at -- at the remand after acquittal. Justice Souter, I want to heartily endorse the -- the way you phrased what the rule should be, which is, trial judges, you ought to take this seriously. Pretermitting the prosecution's case is a very serious matter. You cannot take it back. So think about it. Do it right the first time. As to -- to rule 25 itself, it's true that the -- the judges can't reserve. So what they do as -- as a matter of practice in Massachusetts is they simply deny, and -- and they deny the first one and they have two more opportunities, one at the close of the defendant's case and they have an opportunity at the close of -- after the jury has returned a verdict. At each of those steps, they can make a motion for acquittal. As to the full and fair opportunity, this Court said in Martin Linen that the Government has a right to try the case. They do not have a right to have it proceed to verdict. I'm just taking that straight from Martin Linen. As to, finally, whether or not State law sort of insulates this from Federal -- I see my time is up. Thank you.

KNEEDLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # None # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: These cases implicate the fundamental power of the United States to protect its borders by excluding aliens who arrive at its borders, but are found under the law not to qualify for admission. This Court held more than 100 years ago in Nishimura Ekiu that the power of a nation to forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions is inherent in sovereignty and is central to self-preservation. If it were otherwise, the integrity of the Nation's borders and its security would be at the mercy of a foreign power who might choose to foist aliens onto our country or to the self-help efforts of aliens who might leave another country coming to our shores. The migration crises involving Haitians and Cubans over the last 35 years vividly illustrate the adverse consequences of such a regime, and events of recent years confirm that the threats to the Nation's borders and security are not limited to nearby nations.

KNEEDLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # None # Yes, I believe it is, but it -- but -- but first of all, there is another statute which is highly relevant to this, and that is 1182(d)(5)(A), the parole statute. It is the parole statute that -- that has long governed whether an alien who arrives at our shores and has not been shown to be admissible may enter the United -- may enter the United States. The parole statute is set forth at petition appendix 3a -- excuse me -- page 3a of our brief. That is the only statute that affirmatively authorizes aliens to enter the United States. That statute is -- obviously confers no rights. It is written entirely in terms of the discretion of the Attorney General, now the Secretary of Homeland Security. It says the Attorney -- the Secretary may, in his discretion, temporarily under conditions that he prescribes and for urgent and humanitarian reasons, parole an alien into the United States. But it says that parole does not constitute an admission, and it may be revoked at any time when the Secretary in his opinion concludes that the purposes of the parole have been satisfied.

Because I mean, the question is whether constitutionally we should respect that presumption. And -- and my -- my question basically is this. I can perfectly well understand and I can understand the -- the argument for respecting that presumption. When you're dealing with excluded aliens who are in a literal territorial sense within the border but are never allowed, in effect, beyond a point of initial custody, the ones who are kept at Ellis Island or wherever one may -- may keep them. It is difficult, however, I -- I think to accept what has been called the -- the fiction of custody. When we are dealing with individuals who, although absolutely excludable, were nonetheless welcomed into the United States by a public announcement of the President of the United States, have been allowed into the American population, just as clearly and as readily as they would have been under any other protocol of admission -- and I guess in this case for something like 20 years -- isn't there a point at which the -- the fiction of exclusion simply cannot be accepted for constitutional purposes?
argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9081 # TRUE # MR. KNEEDLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # None # There are a number of responses to that. First, as a factual matter, with respect to welcoming into the United States, what gets cited for that proposition is a statement by President Carter in May 5 of 1980. 10 days later, before the aliens in this case came to this country, he made clear that people should not do this. He encouraged people not to go to Cuba. The INS brought enforcement actions against people who went there. There were criminal prosecutions that were brought. So people were not encouraged to come to the United States in this way. With respect to the regime that you say -- I believe you said they're -- they're admitted just like under any other regime. That is not correct.

They are, it seems to me, in the same boat as someone who is excludable. They -- they do -- do not have any right to remain no more than a parolee has. We have taken away their right to remain.

So there's all kinds of constitutional difference. Still, I don't see how to read the statute one way for one group of people and another way for another. The statutory words in Zadvydas, the words that the Attorney General may detain this individual beyond the removal period, are read in Zadvydas to mean beyond the removal period -- may detain beyond the removal period means for a reasonable time, presumably 6 months, presumptively, related -- reasonable time related to the purpose of the statute which is to find a country willing to accept them. Okay? Now, I haven't found a single case of this Court where you interpret these complicated words one way for one and another way for another. My law clerk found a couple of cases, Communications Work v. Bett and Machinists v. Street, where in Bett particularly the Court strongly implies the contrary. It says you can't read words differently just because we interpreted in one -- you know, one statute, they were interpreted in light of constitutional considerations, and now we have -- those constitutional considerations aren't here, but it's the same words.

It does not permit indefinite detention interpreting it to avoid constitutional threat. We include that once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable, continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.

argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9174 # FALSE # MS. DAHL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because the same words mean the same thing in the same statute, this Court need not reach the constitutional questions presented by the indefinite detention of inadmissible as opposed to deportable aliens. Without going to questions of constitutional doubt, there are three reasons why this Court should hold that section 1231(a)(6) treats inadmissible aliens the same as it treats deportable aliens.
argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9175 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Before you get to that, do you think that that's the only statute applicable here? What about 1182(d)(5)? What's your response to the Government's assertion that that's an independent basis?
argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9176 # TRUE # MS. DAHL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Scalia, I don't believe it provides an independent basis for detention. The immigration law works together in it's various elements, and section 1182, when parole is revoked, treats the alien then as an applicant for admission, and section 1229 places the applicant for admission into removal proceedings. The Government did not obtain a ruling on that argument from the Ninth Circuit, although it made reference to 1182 in its motions to stay the briefing schedule. It ultimately conceded that this case was controlled by Lin Guo Xi, which was a statutory construction of 1231(a)(6), and cert was granted on the 1231(a)(6) issue only. The reading of the statute that we proffer, that the same words mean the same meaning, is consistent with the overall changes Congress made in 1996 in IIRIRA when it eliminated the category of excludable aliens and replaced it with a single, broader category, now called removable aliens, that embraces both inadmissible and deportable aliens. Third, Congress knows how to provide for indefinite detention when it wants to.

The Government was not correct when it said that it -- that this Court has always treated excludable aliens the same. In a case that was a contemporary of the Mezei decision, Kwong Hai Chew, cited at page 45 of our brief, the Court found that an excludable entrant on Ellis Island was entitled to --

argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9182 # TRUE # MS. DAHL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We disagree. I think that it shows that the Court will consider length of time in the country in determining what amount of due process is required. Now, the plain language of the statute of 1231(a)(6) requires the same treatment between inadmissible and deportable aliens. Where there's no difference in the language that Congress has used, this Court can draw no distinctions. There is a presumption that Congress expects its statutes to be read in the same manner as the Supreme Court's interpretation, and because of the interrelationship between the parole statute and the revocation proceedings and removability proceedings, there's no reason for this Court to resort to the 1182 statute to provide the authority that the Government seeks. The relevant authority is section 1231(a)(6).
argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9183 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, what do you think we should do with the 1182? Because suppose you prevail on your argument that it's the same statute, the same word, it can't be construed differently under 12-whatever, and the Government says fine. We now go to the other string in our bow and we continue to detain this person on the basis of 1182(d)(5)(A).
argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9184 # TRUE # MS. DAHL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the 1182(d)(5)(A) doesn't provide for indefinite detention. What it provides is that upon revocation of parole, the alien is placed into removal proceedings. Once the removal proceedings have been determined and a final order of removal is entered, 1231(a) requires removal within 90 days, and failing that, the appropriate -- the relevant statutory provision is 1231(a)(6). That says that the alien may be detained beyond the removal period and then, if released, subjected to conditions of supervision. 1231 is the only statutory authority for post-removal period detention. Parole deals with entry and 1231(a)(6) --

So this other -- this other matter is a totally -- seen as a totally separate ground.

While the alien is awaiting removal, he is subject to supervision conditions that will safeguard the Government's interests, and for as long as he is waiting, he is under supervision. It's those supervision conditions that distinguish this case from the situation where the Government is finding national security risks. That -- Congress has expressly provided for the indefinite detention of people whom the Attorney General certifies as presenting risks to national security. It's also the presence of a national security risk that distinguishes this case from the Mezei decision.

He challenged that and wanted a hearing and wanted the Attorney General to be required to disclose the evidence. The Court found that his release into the community itself would present a security risk and therefore sustained the denial of the hearing and the detention of Mr. Mezei.

argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9234 # FALSE # MR. MILLS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think that we have lost sight of the statutory scheme that applies here. Section 1182(d)(5)(A) is not a detention statute. It's clearly not preserved as an initial matter. It was not in the answer to either habeas petition. The justification given in the district court in both cases was 1231(a)(6). But, Justice Breyer, there is no need to remand this case because a clear, simple reading of the immigration statutes demonstrates that 1182 is not a detention statute. You have to go through the process, and I attempted to do this in my reply brief, but I think I can do it a little bit more clearly for the Court this morning. When an alien first arrives, he's an applicant for admission. Section 1225(b)(2)(A) of title 8, United States Code says an applicant for admission -- any applicant for admission shall be detained until the removal proceeding unless it is clear, beyond any doubt, that they are entitled to come in. So all aliens, when they apply -- that's the detention statute that initially applies, 1225(b)(2)(A). They are to be detained until there is a removal proceeding. The removal proceeding, which is governed by 1229(a)(1) -- I'm sorry -- 1226(a) -- it is 1229(a) -- is to determine whether the alien is admissible or not, whether they should come in or whether they must be removed. So 1225(b)(2)(A) says detain until that point. 1182(d)(5)(A) then comes in to authorize the Government to stop that process for humanitarian reasons and parole an alien in. We won't have the removal process. We're going to -- we -- we're going to get out of the detention in 1225(b)(2)(A), and we're going to let you out on parole, which is discretionary. That's 1182(d)(5)(A). If at any time, we in our discretion think it is no longer appropriate to keep you on parole, we can revoke that parole, and the statute 1182(d)(5)(A) says once parole is revoked, the alien is treated as, quote, any other applicant for admission. So you go back to 1225(b)(2)(A), which says detain them until the removal proceeding.
argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9235 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, you -- you skipped a -- a phrase. It says when the Attorney General is of the opinion that the purposes of the parole justify nothing more, the individual shall return or be returned to the custody from which he began. And their argument is that custody is different in these cases.
argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9236 # TRUE # MR. MILLS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That custody is the custody under 1225(b)(2)(A). That is the statute that authorizes the custody. That's what they're being returned to. 1225(b)(2)(A) is detention until the removal proceedings. And in the Demore v. Kim case, this case -- this Court said that even if it's a long time and there aren't other procedures in place, you can be detained until your removal order is entered because -- and -- and the emphasis was there's an end date to that. So there's an end date to detention under (b)(2)(A), 1225(b)(2)(A), and it's the removal proceedings. Section 1231 is the statute that governs removal and says, okay, now what happens? It says you have to remove within 90 days, but for certain aliens who've committed crimes or are inadmissible or are otherwise determined to be dangerous, we can detain them beyond. It says may be detained beyond the period. That is the only statute that authorizes any detention of an alien after a removal order other than the specific terrorist statute, 1226(a), which was enacted, which does not authorize indefinite detention. It says -- it has a paragraph labeled indefinite detention, and it says the Government shall not indefinitely detain a terrorist alien that it cannot remove except that if the Government determines -- and -- and it appears to put the burden on the Government -- that the person is a danger to national security or the community, it can detain them for another 6 months. And then you -- you could have indefinite detention, but each time, each 6 months, the statute provides for review. So not only do the sneakers, the aliens who cross across the border in the -- in the dark of night from Mexico or wherever -- not only do they under the Government's own admission have the Zadvydas rights, so too do terrorist aliens by statute. And to suggest that by some implication Congress has intended to authorize the indefinite detention of people that we thought we should welcome into our country, even though we didn't have the ability under our quota system and under our current regulations in 1980 to let them in, somehow they have no rights against indefinite detention. For the Government to --

argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9238 # TRUE # MR. MILLS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor. Justice Ginsburg, that's their sole policy argument, and frankly, it doesn't hold water. Just yesterday in the Jama case, the Government took the position that if Mexico flooded -- flooded our borders with illegal aliens who we could not detain, we know under their own regulations, if they snuck in, we couldn't detain them, but if a new Mexican -- there was a Mexican dictator and he flooded our borders, could we forcibly repatriate them? And the Government said absolutely we can. We can go down and put them back in Mexico. We could do that with the Cubans. We could let them out the gate at Guantanamo Bay. If a -- a rogue nation truly invades our country with its bad aliens, that is an infringement on our sovereignty, and I think that's an act of war. And I think the President has all kinds of options: trade sanctions, go to the United Nations, diplomacy. If it's really something bad that's going to be a -- a threat to our national security, I think --

And this Court should abstain from putting its voice as -- on to the answer. That is a decision for Congress in the first place. In Zadvydas, this Court said the statute doesn't clearly do that, so we're not going to -- we're not going to answer that question as to whether it would be constitutional.

But in -- in this case, because especially the Zadvydas aliens had clear constitutional rights, we avoid the question. The doctrine of constitutional avoidance says the Court doesn't engage in that.

There was part one, which examined whether there is a -- or it determined whether the statute is ambiguous, and part two is whether there's a constitutional error. It was only in the part of the decision deciding whether there's a constitutional problem that the distinction was made. The distinction makes the difference in whether there's a problem or not. And maybe there's not a problem for inadmissible aliens. So, the Court then concluded in Zadvydas that because there's a problem, we look at the statute. This statute could be interpreted to authorize indefinite detention or not. It's ambiguous. Because we have a problem, at least with one category, we're going to choose the -- a safe route.

argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9261 # TRUE # MR. MILLS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's absolutely correct. And they're responding right now. In the 9/11 Commission bill, there is a section that's being negotiated as to whether terrorist aliens who can't be removed because they would be tortured -- whether they can be indefinitely detained. And they're looking at the same limiting language. One point that I'd like to make that I did not get to make directly in the brief, but it was raised. Justice Scalia, you had a question yesterday in the Leocal case, and it -- it raised an issue that I hadn't looked at before on whether a statute can be interpreted differently in a situation where the reason to interpret it is no longer there. And that's the rule of lenity cases. And I cited as a supplemental authority the United States v. Thompson/Center Arms Company, 504 U.S. 505. It's a 1992 decision, and it involved a tax code provision. And the question is, do we apply the rule of lenity? And Justice Stevens, in dissent you said no, because this is a civil case. The rule of lenity doesn't apply. But a three-judge plurality, an opinion by Justice Souter, and a two-justice -- two-judge concurrence by Justice Scalia both agreed that the rule of lenity applied because the statute applies both in criminal and civil contexts. And you can't have one meaning in a criminal context and another in civil. For the same reason, the rule of constitutional avoidance should not result in a statute being interpreted one way when there would be a doubt and another way when there would not.

That interest is different in -- in the case of -- of aliens who are excluded, if we accept that class as distinct from all excludables. And -- and that may allow a much longer period of detention, among other things, to deter dictators from -- from dumping. You've given us an answer to what to do if they dump, but we don't want them to dump in the first place. That argument stops short of saying we can detain them for life, but it would support the -- the position that on a consistent interpretation of the statute, the Government could detain them longer in the excluded cases than in others. What's your answer to that?

But in 1996, IIRIRA abolished the distinction between inadmissible and deportable aliens after they've been ordered removed. Up until that time, it makes a difference. It makes a difference under the Constitution. But once they've been ordered removed -- and this was the Government's argument in Zadvydas.

If there are any mootness concerns about Mr. Benitez, I would refer the Court to Friends of the Environment which said that when a challenged practice has stopped voluntarily, that does not moot a case out in the Supreme Court unless there's some reason to believe they won't go at it again. And the Government has asserted that it can revoke his release at any time for any reason and detain him indefinitely. And the suggestion that the fact that he's been released under the Cuban Review Panel shows that his -- he's been protected is -- is not well taken. He was determined, when he first was detained in -- in 2001, that he was eligible under the Cuban Review Panel to be released. It took 3 years and the week before this case was argued in the highest court of the land before the Immigration Service did what its own regulations told it it had to do. Thank you very much.

Justice Souter, you're exactly right in terms of why the statutory construction or statutory application of the terms in Zadvydas does not control here. The Court's starting point -- again back to page 682 of its opinion, it says, we deal here with aliens who were admitted. The way the Court dealt in the opinion was a matter of statutory construction, and it did it by reading into the statute a reasonable time limitation. What is reasonable for aliens who -- who have been admitted and are subject to what were called deportation is different from aliens who were stopped at the border. And in fact, in the -- in the Court's statutory analysis, it looked to the point that in the Witkovitz jurisdictional statement referring to Congress' constitutional doubts about detention of more than 6 months, those were constitutional doubts about people who were being deported after having been allowed to be here. There has never --

argument next in No. 03-878, Clark v. Martinez # 03-878 # 9272 # TRUE # MR. KNEEDLER # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It -- with respect -- with respect, it has not. And -- and if I could -- if I could explain this. This -- going back to Mezei, this Court held and in fact rejected a very similar argument. The rationale of the court of appeals in Mezei was that deportable aliens are subject to an express, not an implied, 6-month limitation. And the court of appeals said the aliens in that -- the alien in that case, once he couldn't be removed to another country, should be released because the purpose of keeping him to return him to another country was no longer being served. This Court rejected that argument, even though there was a statutory express limitation of 6 months for deportable aliens, held that an alien who had been on Ellis Island for 2 years did not have to be released. In reliance on that decision, Congress passed the parole statute to leave the release in -- excuse me -- Mezei was after it, but the -- the executive branch has relied on that rationale. The Cuban review regulations that are at issue here have been in place for 15 years under the parole statute. As Congress well knew, when it acted in 1996, the -- this program was the subject of many hearings in Congress. There were cases -- the Barrera case out of the Ninth Circuit sustained a 10-year detention of a Mariel Cuban. It is implausible to believe in 1996, when Congress enacted IIRIRA, that it intended to cut back on the longstanding power of the executive branch to prevent hordes of aliens from coming into our country and to impose an arbitrary 6-month limitation. I -- I think there's no argument that if an alien is detained before removal proceedings are begun, that there is no 6-month limitation. His release is entirely up to the Attorney General under the parole regulations. It's -- it's implausible to believe that once Congress actually enters a formal order of exclusion or now removal against an alien, the person is no longer in an ambiguous situation, the executive branch says you're not eligible, that suddenly that person who has been formerly found not eligible, would be subject to a 6 month limitation that did not apply up until '96 and doesn't even apply until these -- to these aliens until removal proceedings have been begun. So the right way to look at this statute as what's a reasonable time under 1231(a)(6) has to take into account that historic background of the United States being able to protect its borders. And there is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended to overrule this longstanding program for Mariel Cubans, which has operated, as I said, for 15 years.

As this Court has held, that definition is sweeping and represents an intent by Congress to exert the full measure of its taxing power. The court of appeals decisions below, by excluding from respondent's gross income the portion of litigation proceeds paid to their attorneys under contingent fee agreements, is inconsistent with two longstanding Federal tax law principles for defining gross income.

Now, I mean -- and let me make two points about that. The first is that as a -- as a general matter, the tax code defines gross income expansively, and there's a number of this Court's cases that make that clear. Then -- then the question becomes are there deductions provided that allow for certain expenses to be deducted.

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9299 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, we believe that the same principles would apply to class action lawsuits as to other lawsuits in terms of the taxation of litigation proceeds. It may very well be the case in a number of class action contexts that when applying those principles, the proper -- the proper analysis leads to the conclusion that the taxpayer doesn't exert sufficient control and that the payment of attorney's fees is not in response to a debt owed by the taxpayer. And so there might be a different result.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9300 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I -- I thought we were -- our attention was pointed to a number of instances where the Internal Revenue Service did not require the taxpayer to show all the attorney's fees as income in those class action situations.

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9303 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I want to be clear. We think the same principles apply across the board to defining gross income. In applying that in a number of class action contexts, the proper answer may be that it's not included in gross income because there wasn't sufficient control and because it wasn't paid in -- in lieu of a debt owed by the taxpayer. But here --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9304 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why -- why isn't there as much control in each case?

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9307 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Again, I'm -- I'm trying to be as specific as I can. There may be situations in which, even in the class action context, there's a fee agreement between the -- the class member and the lawyer so that the payment of attorney's fees is in satisfaction of a debt owed by the class member, and in that situation we think that it would be --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9308 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why -- why would -- why would that analysis appear?

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9310 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So we're in the -- so we're in the situation we're in right now, aren't we?
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9311 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We are in the situation in which there's a need to apply the general principles for defining gross income.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9312 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # All right. But let me just -- I'll just press the point one more time. I don't understand, based on what you've said, why the class action result would be different from the result that you're arguing for here if you win this case.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9313 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And -- and what I'm trying to point out, Your Honor, is that there may very well be class actions where it's not different. There may be some when -- where it is if it's the case that there's no contractual obligations to pay the fee -- pay the fee between the class member and the attorney, and if it's the case that the class member really exerts no meaningful control over the -- over the attorney's fees portion --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9314 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I thought the class action distinction that the commissioner had was between opt in and opt out.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9315 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That is certainly one of the factors that -- that the commissioner has looked to in those class --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9316 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So if you opt in, then you did exercise control. So all the money is yours. But if you opt out, you didn't have control over the suit because you didn't opt out. I mean, you just were lethargic.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9317 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Again, those are all facts --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9318 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's the basic thing. I mean, I'm trying to understand what the principle is for the reason that it's pretty hard for me to reconcile the commissioner's view in the class action case with the punitive damage case because there the person has control over the lawsuit. So why doesn't all the punitive damage, attorney's fees that come out of that, and so forth belong to -- in other words, it sounds to me, as I read this, something of a mess, and I'd like to know what the clear principle is.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9319 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor. And -- and just to be clear, I -- I don't think the commissioner has ever taken the position that all class actions don't present the -- the possibility of the attorney's fees portion of the award being included in -- in the class member's gross income. Now, there are real enforcement issues, as a practical matter, to trying to -- to trying to implement that. You can imagine a number of class actions --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9320 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # When you say the class member, do you -- you mean the named representative. The class may include thousands of people, but it would be income to the named representative? Is that --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9321 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, presumably, Your Honor, that -- only the portion of the attorney's fees that would be attributable to the -- the named representative's recovery would be included in the named representative's gross income. I don't think that the named representative would be on the hook, if you will, for all of the attorney's fees that would relate to other class members' recoveries. But I think what all this points out is that --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9322 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, then -- then would it be -- would the income then go to each class -- would each class member have a share of the income?
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9323 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In a number of instances, yes, Your Honor. Again, the -- the way that we think that class action cases should be resolved is the same way that -- that these issues are approached in all cases, which is to look at the type of relationship that exists between the -- the client and the attorney to see whether the payment is made in -- in response to a debt owed by the client and also to look to the degree of control that the client has over the -- the underlying source of income. And in this context, it is --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9324 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Suppose -- suppose the same amount were paid, as was paid here, to the attorney, but it was not by way of a contingent fee, that the -- the client had committed to pay this dollar amount in a dollar amount.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9325 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # As a flat fee?
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9326 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # As a flat fee. What -- what would the tax treatment of that be?
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9327 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, I think in fact it is undisputed in -- in the -- in these cases that if the payment of attorney's fees had either been under an hourly rate arrangement or a flat fee arrangement, that the entire amount of the litigation proceeds would be included in the -- in the respondent's gross income and nothing about the contingent fee arrangements here should -- should alter that result. The respondents --

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9336 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- a transfer of the -- the cause of action. Certainly if you buy a piece of real estate and -- and there's lawyer's business connected with it, you -- you don't -- you don't take an ordinary deduction which is subject to the alternative minimum tax for those lawyer's fees.

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9358 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So in a very real -- in -- in a very real sense, in a -- in the legal sense, the client just doesn't have control.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9359 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Your Honor, we disagree with that for, it seems to me, at least three reasons. The first is that at the time the client entered into the fee agreement, he certainly had control then. He had complete control over his cause of action. He was --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9360 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, he -- he did or he didn't, but there was no money there. There was nothing there.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9361 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there was an entitlement to recover. Now, there might have been a dispute as to the proper amount or whether that claim was valid, but he was entitled to recover based on the injury he suffered that was cognizable at law and that gave raise to a cause of action. Now, in exchange for legal services, he promised to pay a portion of the recovery to the lawyer. That is a promise to pay a fee. That is not an assignment or any other transfer of the underlying cause of action. And it is undisputed, I think --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9362 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Salmons, doesn't the plausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption that what the -- that the cause of action at the time the -- that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer is a cause of action which has the same value as the ultimate recovery that the lawyer gets? Whereas, in fact, the cause of action at the time of the agreement with the lawyer has an inchoate value. The -- the value that is actually realized is going to depend in part on the -- on the skill and -- and the -- the gumption of the lawyer. So that the -- what I'm getting at -- and -- and going to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems to me that the value realized as opposed to the right to sue are two different figures. And I don't see realistically how the client has complete control over the value realized, which we don't even know until the lawyer has done his work and gotten the check.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9363 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, two responses to that question, if I may. The first is that, as a matter of law, it is the client that controls the cause of action and throughout the time period, even after they -- they enter into an -- a contingent fee agreement, it is the client that owns and controls the cause of action and he decides whether to settle. He decides whether to press forward or withdraw the case. He decides whether to fire the lawyer or not. He is a -- he controls the source of the income. Therefore --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9364 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Even -- even the potential lawyer's fee. I mean, suppose this client has a major dental repair and he's got a risk-taking dentist, and he says, dentist, I'm going to give you a deal. I know you like to take risks. I may win big in my lawsuit, in which case you get everything; and I may lose, in which case you get nothing. The dentist says, fine, I'll take it. Can the client in that agreement with his dentist give what will be the lawyer's fee, the part that will go to the lawyer under the contingency fee agreement?
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9365 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, presumably, Your Honor, if he's already -- he's already promised that to the attorney, he would be in violation of his agreement with the attorney if he did so, and his attorney could sue him to recover or the dentist could sue him to recover.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9366 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Then he doesn't have -- then he doesn't have dominion over that portion.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9367 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, because he's -- he's given it away. In that sense I think -- and -- and in answering this, if I may just go back to one point that Justice Souter made and that is that I don't think it's the case that our analysis turns at all on how you value the claim, either at the time of the fee agreement or afterwards. Our analysis says at all relevant times, regardless of whether the value changed or not, the client was at all times in control of the underlying source of income, and it's just as if in Helvering v. Horst the father assigns the -- the bond coupon to his son, but he controls the underlying source of income.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9368 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No, but the bond coupon has a certain value at the time the father assigns it.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9369 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's true.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9370 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # The only thing that has to be realized after the assignment of the coupon is the passage of time at which it will be payable. Here we do not have a definite value. We don't know -- there's no way to know for sure what that value will be until the lawsuit is over with. The -- the two are not comparable.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9371 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, that would be equally true of an assignment of a stock dividend while I retain the stock. I may not know what the dividend payment is going to be, but if I control the underlying source of income, i.e., the stock, then the transfer to someone else of the dividend doesn't alter the incident of tax, even if it's unknown. And I would point out that in Lucas v. Earl, the husband and wife in that case entered into agreement to assign to each other 50 percent of their income in 1901, long before the income tax was even instituted, and the tax years at issue in that case were 1920 and 1921. If anything, it was much more speculative and uncertain what income would have been earned 20 years later in that case, and that did not stop the Court from --

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9374 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Can I -- can I ask you a question relating to the Davenport -- what's been referred to as the Davenport theory? I had thought that -- that the service has used the -- the transaction theory with regard to legal fees payable for a lawsuit seeking increased compensation for the condemnation of real estate where the taxpayer had objected to the amount that the condemning entity was offering and brought suit in court and with a contingent fee to the lawyer and that the service treated that as -- as part of the transaction cost. Am I wrong about that?
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9375 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, to my knowledge, the -- the IRS has had a consistent position that the entire amount of litigation proceeds, including the amount that may be paid to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement, even in the condemnation context, is tax -- is included in the gross income of -- of the taxpayer. And I would point Your Honor to the case out of the Federal Circuit, Baylin v. United States. That case involved a condemnation action, and the court of appeals in that case addressed the issue that's presented in these cases and concluded that it was includable in gross income.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9376 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Maybe my recollection is wrong. I'll look again.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9377 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And -- and I would point out, Your Honor -- and this has to do, I think, with the impact of the new legislation that's been pointed to in the supplemental briefs -- that at least six of the court of appeals cases addressing the issue presented in these cases involved claims that would not be covered under the new section 703 because they -- they don't involve claims for unlawful discrimination or -- or FCA claims or certain Medicare claims --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9378 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But can -- can I ask you to go back for a minute? I guess the IRS -- you're seeing the lawsuit as the income-generating asset.

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9380 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And you're looking at the control of the plaintiff, for example, over the lawsuit as something that determines whether it's his income. And he, of course, can't give away his income. But on that theory, to go back to Justice O'Connor's original question, then the punitive damages also must be his income because he has equal control over them and they grow out of the income-producing asset. And that, of course, is what's bothering me because it seems to me that your theory, which is a well-established theory, coupled with a Congress that seems to be willing to take away deductions for expenses that lead to the income, could produce an income tax that in many cases, not just a few, exceeds the income that an individual has. And I would like to know what in the law is there to guard against that result.

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9395 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But I -- that's why I ask you. Is there any protection in the law whatsoever? Or if Congress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see -- say, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small business people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses. So it taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income. There's no protection in your view against that result. And you just said, well, Congress decided to do it, it decided to do it.

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9398 # TRUE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, if I may. The way I would respond to that concern is that the proper way to address it is not as the courts below did and as respondents urge, to alter or distort the general definition for gross income under the -- under the tax code which may have broad ramifications in a number of areas outside of this one, but to go to Congress, as in fact people have done, and to get them to make -- make additional deductions or otherwise alter the alternative minimum tax, which generates the primary concern I think at issue in these cases.

His legal fees were, by the IRS, subtracted from the award, and he was taxed only upon the proceeds reduced by the legal fees. Now, how do you explain that situation there?

Well, in fact, if there is no textual difference for tax purposes between the law, so far as it concerns these -- these so-called discrimination recoveries and non-discrimination recoveries that have the same problem that Justice O'Connor is talking about, shouldn't we infer that at least the Senate of the United States assumes that this does not get into gross?

The new bill is not retroactive, and we think it's clear that it does work a change because from, among other reasons, it's undisputed that if these fees had been paid on an hourly fee basis, they would have been included in gross income and -- and the alternative minimum tax would apply.

It -- it does seem to me that we -- we have to be very careful in this case not to distort the revenue law for other transactions that are not before the Court. And the -- the natural extension of your position is that anytime when the taxpayer enters into an agreement with an agent to pay the agents an amount contingent on the success of the venture, that it's not income, that -- that the -- that the payment is not income to the principal. And I just can't accept it.

My position is that the assignment of income doctrine does not apply.

JONES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I am not trying to avoid your question, but I'm trying to clarify that I am not asking this Court to determine who has the income in those cases because there is a large body of law and a large body of statutory law that answers the questions for each of those examples.

He -- he thinks it's -- it's attached to transactions, and -- and much of his argument is devoted to showing that capital transactions are no different from other transactions as far as the Internal Revenue Code's desire to match the -- the gain with the expenses concerned. And that's the part of his theory that I'm not so sure about because aside from the -- aside from the condemnation case that I mentioned, I -- I don't know of any other cases in which the Internal Revenue Service has treated transaction costs the way he would have it done. Maybe it makes sense, but I --
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9517 # TRUE # MR. JONES # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I would like to make one additional point in the few seconds I have left. The -- the Solicitor General is arguing that the language, the statutory language, of the new statute implies a particular result. This Court decided as early as 1940 in the Higgins v. Smith case when the commissioner made the exact same argument, and this Court said -- and I quote -- that does not follow. The statutory language says that to the extent this income is -- this -- this money is included in income, to the extent it is included in income -- it doesn't say whether it is or not -- then a deduction will be allowed. And that as neutral a statement as I can think of. There is nothing in the statutory language that implies one answer or the other. But I emphasize to the Court that the -- the commissioner is confusing intent with result when he discusses the cases upon which he is relying. Those cases reached a result and they corrected that result. We don't have an abuse in this situation. And the assignment of income doctrine should not be stretched beyond its bounds by this Court. It should be limited to its historical use. This is a misuse. Thank you very much.

Neither section 61(a) nor any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code expressly requires that a Federal civil rights litigant, such as Mr. Banks, include in his gross income the portion of a litigation recovery that was earned by, retained by, and already taxed to his attorney as a contingent fee. The commissioner's position in this case relies exclusively on the misapplication of a judicial doctrine known as the assignment of income doctrine. That doctrine originated and developed as a judicial anti-abuse rule, designed to prevent high-bracket taxpayers --

It plainly did not originate that way.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9526 # TRUE # MR. CARTY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Scalia, I respectfully disagree. It is true, as the commissioner and you point out, that at the time of the agreement between the husband and wife, the income tax was not in existence. However, the agreement certainly was in existence after the income tax was passed. So that could have been a reason why the agreement was never rescinded. In addition, in another landmark case from 1937, Blair, this Court expressly looked to whether there was a tax avoidance motive. And this is how this principle is taught in first-year tax class. That's the whole purpose behind this. As a matter of fact, the commissioner in a -- in a different context actually looked to the fact, with respect to a particular transaction, whether there was a tax avoidance purpose.

CARTY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Nevertheless -- nevertheless, I -- I think there may be some -- some difference in degree that you might even recognize between the two cases. Another issue I'd like to address is the impact of the fee shifting statutes, if I could get to that quickly. It is a bedrock principle of taxation that settlements of a claim are taxed the same as a judgment would have been taxed. Mr. Banks' settlement was achieved in lieu of his claims under title VII and 42 U.S.C., sections 1981 and 1983. Now, each of these statutes contains a fee shifting provision which enables a court to award attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. The defendant in Mr. Banks' case, the California Department of Education -- they therefore settled Mr. Banks' claim in lieu of their exposure under these fee shifting statutes. An award pursuant to these fee shifting statutes is separate and distinct from a damages recovery and therefore should not be taxable to a plaintiff. And the Federal tax consequences to Mr. Banks, the litigant who settles, shouldn't be any different as well. Otherwise, this Court would be discouraging settlement. Therefore, a judicial anti-abuse rule should not be misused to undermine the statutory scheme devised by Congress to encourage civil rights litigants to bring meritorious claims and vindicate national policy. Unless the Court has any further questions?
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9582 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The Government says on that branch of it, well, the fees -- the lodestar fee, that's one thing. A court awards it, but that's quite different from the one-third/one-half even contingent fee. The court has control over the fee shifting, but we're not dealing with any court award here.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9583 # TRUE # MR. CARTY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. Mr. Banks settled his claims. Yet, we are pressing the point that Mr. Banks shouldn't be treated any differently for tax purposes than a litigant who recovers pursuant to a fee shifting statute. Otherwise, the Court would be discouraging settlement. If there's any other questions.

argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9586 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Salmons, you have a little over 2 minutes.
argument in two cases, the Commissioner of Revenue # 03-892 # 9588 # FALSE # MR. SALMONS # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Your Honor. It is clear that the only thing that respondents' attorneys earned under the fee agreements was the right to be paid a fee for their services. In petitioner's view, those agreements don't even give rise to an assignment of income in the ordinary sense. If you look at the text of the fee agreement in the Banaitis case -- the Banks' fee agreement is not in the record -- among other things, it makes clear that if there is a termination -- and it provides lots of grounds on which the attorney-client relationship can be terminated -- that the attorney will be paid a reasonable fee, calculated at the sum of $175 per hour. That doesn't sound like an assignment of any income or even an assignment of the underlying cause of action. Even if it did, it is clear that in every assignment of income case, the assignor loses control over that income that he assigned. That doesn't stop the application of the proper tax principles, however. The -- the respondents in these cases suffered a legally cognizable injury. They had a claim. That claim entitled them to a recovery. They retained services to pursued that claim. If they had paid their lawyers on an hourly basis, those lawyers may have been just as necessary to the actual outcome of the case as their contingent fee attorneys. Both the -- an hourly fee attorney and a contingent fee attorney in both of the States at issue here -- and in fact, in all States of which I'm aware -- received precisely the same attorney's lien. That lien makes clear that the relationship between attorney and client starts out as that between a master and an agent and then is converted through the fee agreement to that between a creditor and a debtor, and the lien secures the debt and ensures its payment. When the proceeds from the litigation are paid to the attorney, it satisfies the respondent's debt and is therefore income to the attorney. Under the separate and alternative ground of this Court's Old Colony decision, it goes far and beyond even the holding with regard to an assignment of income. To address just a couple of questions that came up, I would point out that in the class action context, again, as I indicated, there are a number of differences. And just to be a little more specific about some of them, generally speaking there's no unilateral right to settle a -- a case by class members. There's no unilateral right to dismiss the case, and there's no right to a determined fee.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9597 # FALSE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Stay and abeyance is the proper way to administer the total exhaustion rule under the unique facts of this case. Several Justices of this Court already have endorsed stay and abeyance, and seven of the eight circuit courts of appeals that have considered the issue have permitted stay and abeyance under similar circumstances. Section 2254 and the decisions of this Court in Granberry v. Greer and Strickland v. Washington make clear that exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement. District courts have the inherent authority and the broad discretion to issue stays in cases that are within their jurisdiction.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9598 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I think that's unquestionable. The -- the issue really is whether it's an abuse of that discretion to -- to grant a stay and abeyance when the -- the petitioner comes before the court for habeas without having exhausted in State court. I mean, that's the question. I think everybody will stipulate that there's power to -- to stay proceedings, but is it an abuse of discretion to do so in these circumstances given the statute that -- that wants a 1-year, prompt resort to the Federal courts.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9604 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't the petitioner for habeas have to first go to the State court and exhaust the State court claims? Here that wasn't done. The petitioner eventually ended up in Federal court with a laundry list of 30-some unexhausted State claims, for goodness sakes. Why shouldn't those have been presented in the first instance to the State court?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9605 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, in an ideal world, they would be presented in the first instance, but we're dealing with a -- a world where 93 percent of petitioners are proceeding pro se.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9608 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, but it's a free ride if you say -- so long as you get in within the 1-year period, the court can then give you another 3 years or as long as the court thinks is reasonable for you to go back and -- and do what you were supposed to do before you arrived.

I mean, what do we do to encourage the procedure to be followed? Congress did want all this compressed and thought people should apply first to State court and, when those are exhausted, then within the time limit apply to Federal court. But this -- this scheme does something else, it seems to me.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9613 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, Congress wanted to compress certainly the time between exhaustion of the State remedies and the time when the petitioner came to Federal court. However, Congress gave unlimited tolling while there is any proceeding going in -- in State court. I -- I see this stay and abeyance as a procedure that gets applied somewhat infrequently and at the discretion of a judge to -- a district court judge to apply or not apply when it's appropriate to --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9614 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is there a difference -- would you say there's a difference between a case where the petitioner comes into Federal court in the first instance with this laundry list or as, if I recall correctly, this case, goes first to the State court and then, when it's dismissed from the State court, comes to Federal court with the same basic list which has been exhausted, plus others which have not? Would you distinguish the case on the propriety of stay and abeyance of passing up the State court, going to Federal court first, going to State court with your pro se petition raising a bunch of claims but not all of them, and then coming to Federal court?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9615 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think it truly depends on the circumstances which of those two hypotheticals present a more compelling case for stay and abeyance.

The district court found eight of those claims to be unexhausted, Your Honor, and made that finding after Mr. Rhines' 1-year AEDPA period had run. The finding -- Mr. Rhines had filed in February of 2000 pro se. The district court's conclusion that he had a mixed petition and that there were eight unexhausted claims was made in July of 2002.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9620 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # One of the problems is that the statute encourages prompt resolution in -- in the Federal system as well, and under a stay and abey procedure, you could have a district judge who lets the matter sit for 9-10 months and all of a sudden issues a stay and abey. How are we going to control that?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9621 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, I think the alternative that the State proposes presents an even more troubling illustration. A district court, of course, can proceed at its own -- at its own rate, grant a stay, grant the terms of the stay as it sees fit, and I believe that takes care of the consideration that -- that Your Honor's question indicated, Justice Kennedy. The suggestion of the State sets up a situation where, according to the State, they want Rhines to purge his -- his claim -- his petition of the unexhausted claims and proceed in State court at the same time, which is unseemly to have Mr. Rhines proceeding on 27 exhausted claims in Federal court at the same time that he is proceeding on 8 claims in State court. Now, South Dakota is a little bit unique. It -- it allows a second State habeas action. There's no time bar to a second State habeas action. In fact, the South Dakota legislature has made a policy decision that indigent prisoners are entitled to representation of counsel in their first habeas.

Lundy to go with the State's view. And let me explain. The approach of stay and abeyance is more consistent with the principles of Rose v. Lundy than the -- than the State's position. In Rose, this Court was concerned about comity and federalism. It -- it serves the interests of comity and federalism for a Federal court to suspend consideration of a Federal habeas case while a petitioner has a remedy and is actually pursuing it in State court. The petitioner may be granted the remedy in State court, which in turn would render the Federal petition moot altogether. There could be, between the competing State and Federal cases, competition for the transcript or even the exhibits. Rose v. Lundy also contemplated a process that would not unreasonably impair the petitioner's right and would give the petitioner the choice of either purging the unexhausted claims or going back to State court, exhausting the claims, and then coming back to Federal court with one fully exhausted --

Congress was not attempting to frustrate or impede the petitioner's right to seek State court relief or --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9639 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes, but Congress, I think under this scheme, envisioned having someone make all the State claims the first time around, gather them up and go to State court, and let them take as long as they like -- no statute will run until that's complete -- and then go to the Federal court. And this does an end run around that approach.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9640 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, I don't believe this does an end run because this is different than -- than tolling. First of all, in tolling it's automatic under a statute, and stay and abeyance is always discretionary with the court. The court can grant or deny the stay and abeyance order, alter it, revoke it, or in this case, put time limits on the petitioner's right to go back and -- and forth. Also, Mr. Rhines has complied with the AEDPA period. He did file. The unusual situation that could result here is if you assume a prisoner B who's in Rhines' same position and files at the same time, when only approximately 9 days have elapsed on his AEDPA period. Petitioner B, let's assume, files three claims: one exhausted, one unexhausted, and one there's a dispute over whether it's exhausted or not. Because petitioner B had a short trial perhaps or draws a different judge in the District of South Dakota, the judge can rule on that case perhaps within 100 days. It gives petitioner B, under my scenario, 256 days to go to State court, exhaust his claims, and then come back into Federal court with one fully exhausted petition. Rhines would be in the position of prisoner B in my scenario but for the fact that his claims are -- are much more complicated. He is serving a -- a sentence of death. He did have a long trial. And under that situation, it's simply unfair to someone in Rhines' place to have his right to a review of the eight unexhausted claims cut short because he had a complicated case or the district court was slow in getting to a decision.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9641 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That -- that happens often with time limits. I mean, it depends on when the court finishes its job and so forth. What do you do about -- about our opinion in -- in Duncan v. Walker where we refused to toll the limitation period during the pendency of a -- of the Federal proceeding and -- and said, in -- in justification of that holding, by tolling the limitation period for the pursuit of State remedies and not during the pendency of applications for Federal review, 2244 provides a powerful incentive for litigants to exhaust all available State remedies before proceeding in the lower Federal courts?

That's not really true. Sometimes it's -- it's in his interest to delay it as much as possible. Witnesses will die. People will move away.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9652 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The district court can refuse to issue a stay and abeyance order. It can put tight deadlines on a stay and abeyance order. The district court can revoke a stay and abeyance order. It can alter it if there is delay. I believe that is a decision that should be left to the court that's closest to the facts, the district court.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9653 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Do you think the procedure should be any different between capital cases and noncapital cases? We're basically talking about what would be an abuse of discretion, as you indicated at the outset. Do you think the same rule should apply to both, or do you think there might be -- because there is a greater incentive to delay in the capital case than there is in the noncapital case.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9654 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # You're right, Justice Stevens. I -- it's difficult to develop a rule that distinguishes between the two classes, but I do believe that's in the realm of the discretion of the district court. The district court can set very tight deadlines on a petitioner returning to State court to exhaust remaining remedies like the Court here set a deadline of 60 days, and in the circuit courts, more commonly the deadline is 30 days to go back to State court and then 30 days to return once the State proceeding is -- is completed.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9655 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But you -- you don't really think we can hold that line, giving less favorable treatment to somebody who's -- who's trying to argue against a capital penalty, less favorable treatment to him than somebody who's -- who just wants to avoid 10 years in jail?

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9656 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm not advocating less favorable treatment or more favorable treatment for that matter. I believe the rule has to be consistent between the two.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9665 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # How -- how general is -- is this problem? And -- and to what extent is it tied to the fact that you can bring a second habeas in South Dakota? I mean, in -- in most States, if this had happened, I presume, when you went back to the State court, the State court would say, you know, you didn't -- you didn't put in these claims the last time around and they're procedurally barred. Isn't that what would happen in -- in most other States?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9666 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that's an excellent point and on footnotes 9 and 10 of the yellow brief, there is a litany of the State procedural rules, and many States would bar a second habeas or would put a strict time limit that the petitioner could not meet. South Dakota is different in that regard.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9667 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9668 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # South Dakota allows a second habeas and, indeed, allows a petitioner in a second habeas to show cause for a default by proving that he received ineffective assistance of habeas counsel, which is unique among the States. Yes, many States that don't allow a second remedy would -- would not -- we would not be in this situation that we are here. However, South Dakota does. And in fairness to Mr. Rhines, it makes sense to stay the Federal petition and to allow him to exhaust his State court remedies on satisfaction of Rose and to come back with a fully exhausted claim.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9669 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Unless what would happen in these other States as the -- is that the court would grant the -- the stay of proceedings in order to let him go back to the State court and be told after however long it takes that -- that his -- his claims are now procedurally barred. Do you think the Federal court would simply make its own determination that the claims would be rejected by the State court and therefore it would not stay? I don't know.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9670 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I believe that would -- could be and -- and should be a factor in a district court's consideration of whether to grant stay and abeyance, Your Honor. The State has expressed concerns about delay. There are four reasons why those concerns are overstated. First, in the 3 and a half years since Duncan v. Walker was decided, there have been cases in circuit courts of appeals that have approved of the stay and abeyance procedure. None of those cases evidence that it is being misused or is causing undue delay. Second, the terms of the stay themselves can restrict a petitioner's delay, as I've already recounted the -- the district court did here. Third, this Court in Slack v. McDaniel addressed very similar arguments to what the State is making now about delay through a second habeas filing. And this -- this Court noted that the Rules of Civil Procedure vest courts with flexibility to prevent vexatious or delayed litigation and that there are other reasons why those concerns expressed in Slack v. McDaniel were -- were overwrought. Fourth and finally, on the prospect of delay, as already mentioned in answer to one of Justice Scalia's questions, the vast majority of petitioners are not under a capital sentence. It is not hyperbole to say that 99.4 percent of Federal section 2254 habeas petitioners are not serving -- are not under a capital penalty. Those are statistics from the year 2000 from the Department of Justice. And those, I think with the extremely rare exception, are people who believe rightly or wrongly that they're in prison because their constitutional rights have been violated and would not favor delay under any circumstance. So the delay concern that the State raises is -- is overwrought. Unless there are other questions, I'd reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9671 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Thank you, Mr. Lang. General Long, we'll hear from you, please.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9673 # FALSE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Congress -- excuse me. Congress carefully crafted a scheme designed to encourage State prisoners first to exhaust all of their State post-conviction remedies and then to file their habeas corpus petitions as soon as possible. The congressional design includes three mutually dependent statutes, including a 1-year statute of limitations, a tolling provision, and a total exhaustion requirement, the combined effect of which is supposed to reduce delay, serve the principles of comity, finality, and federalism. However, stay and abeyance erodes each side of this triangular statutory design. Stay and abeyance allows tolling in Federal court when Duncan said there should be none. It extends the statute of limitations beyond 1 year, and it ignores the total exhaustion requirement of 2254(b). The result is that State prisoners, especially capital prisoners, are encouraged to file mixed petitions and rewarded with delay if they do so.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9674 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # What -- what is your answer to -- to your -- your brother's answer on this, and -- and that is, that the -- the existence of stay and abey as a possibility is not a right to stay and abey? And -- and if a district judge finds that a -- there is reason to believe that the defendant is gaming the system, because he's a capital defendant and wants to delay or wants delay for any other reason, there's -- there's no requirement that -- that there be a stay and -- and abeyance order. And why -- why doesn't that take care of what I -- I think is a very legitimate issue that you raise? Why isn't that a -- a sufficient answer to it?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9675 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that -- I think that the -- the answer is that Congress designed the system to resolve all those issues in State court first. I think one of the things that needs to be kept in mind is that an unexhausted claim is, by its very nature and by definition, a claim where there's an available remedy in State court.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9676 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Oh, again, there's no question about that. And -- and in a perfect -- sort of in a perfect system, I think your objection would be unanswerable. The trouble with the system we've got is -- is the trouble that -- that is -- is undisputed here, and that is, that most of these petitions, the overwhelming number of them, are going to be pro se petitions. Exhaustion can -- can be tricky. The -- the statute of limitations is -- is going to run and -- and an individual can end up in the -- in the situation that this one had. What -- what he's asking for, in effect, is how do we tinker with the system, in effect, to prevent its being a -- a very unfair burden on people who don't have the sophistication to help themselves.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9677 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think the system needs to be tinkered with, Your Honor.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9678 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I -- I know but there's -- what -- what is your answer on the merits to the fact that most of the people who are going to ask for stay and abey are -- are going to be pro ses, or at least have gotten into the mess that they're in as a result of pro se representation, and -- and that -- that exhaustion in close cases can be a very -- very tricky issue? What -- what's your response to that?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9679 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # My response is in two parts. First of all, Your Honor, I agree with you that exhaustion can be a tricky issue, but it's -- it's the most tricky in the question about whether or not the question has been fairly presented. The less tricky portion of the question is whether or not the claim is unexhausted, having been -- that means there's an available remedy in State court. The easy way to sort that out is just to file your claim in State court. If there is in fact an available remedy, then you get tolling, and that solves the problem. I --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9680 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I'm not sure -- I'm not sure it's -- it's true, are you, that -- that the reason people get into these situations is because they were pro se. That wasn't the case here. I -- I think they probably get into this situation very often because they have a better or at least a different lawyer at the Federal habeas stage than they had at the State habeas stage, and this new lawyer sees additional claims that -- that he wants to make. Isn't -- isn't that exactly what happened here?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9681 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's -- I -- I suspect that's the typical case in -- in capital cases. Mr. Rhines is currently --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9682 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It's typical. I mean, what I have in the statistics is that about 36 percent of all the habeases are dismissed for failure to exhaust, and 93 percent of all of the habeas petitioners are pro se. Now, the conclusions I draw for that is it's probably these pro se people -- I mean, 93 percent are pro se -- that will get the procedural dismissals, and certainly a third or so, if we agree with you, of all of the habeas petitions filed in -- in Federal court are going to be finished, terminated. The door is closed because it takes a Federal court about nine months on average to process a habeas. Now, you just take that and you say, we've closed the door of the Federal court to a third of all the habeas petitioners. And if I had thought that Congress wanted that, then I might say fine. But I thought that Duncan -- and I know I was on the other side of the case, but I felt the majority had a pretty good point on the language, to tell you the truth. But what I didn't think they had such a -- I mean, I couldn't find much of a congressional purpose one way or the other there. I thought the purpose of the statute of limitations is really to get people to file their petitions. Once they file them, they have a year but it's tolled. You know, I mean, you understand the thing. I -- I'm really looking for you to tell me some tremendously strong congressional purpose that's served so strong that you want to knock a third of the petitioners out of Federal court forever.

I -- I think that even for a pro se petitioner, I do not think it is more difficult for him to find the door of the State courthouse than it is to find the door of the Federal courthouse. And the key, I think, to your argument is that claims are unexhausted by definition if there's an available State court remedy. Therefore, by definition, they ought to be going to the State courthouse rather than the Federal courthouse.

I think that's -- it's as simply as that. And -- and what the statute is designed to do, I -- I think you're telling us, is to say, look it, be careful. Make all your claims in the State court the first time. That doesn't seem to me to be too much to demand.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9695 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I take it -- I take it that one of the answers to the observation that the Federal court is closed to a third of the claims is that that's not true with respect to the exhausted claims. The -- the petition can simply be purged as to unexhausted claims and as to the exhausted claims, the courthouse door remains open.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9696 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I agree with that. The -- let's -- let's deal with the facts in this case.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9699 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- with respect to this case? I thought this case was such a good illustration of the problem. If claims came into the Federal court neatly labeled, exhausted, unexhausted, then I think that you would have a very strong argument. But as this case illustrates, the question of whether it's been exhausted or not is something on which people can disagree. And I suppose why the district court took well over a year to decide this case is the petitioner says, I've exhausted everything, and the prosecutor says, you have not exhausted 12. And the district court is going by the -- going over these one by one and says in the end, you're both wrong. My list is eight. And it's that problem of has this claim been exhausted. Now, if it was a case of deliberately withholding a case from State court and bringing it up fresh in -- in the Federal court, that would be a case where the Federal court should say, go away, you didn't even try. But what do you do with these cases where it's really hard to tell whether the claim has been exhausted?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9700 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That was not the situation in this case, Your Honor.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9701 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Then why did the -- the district judge says four on the State's list have been exhausted?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9702 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the -- factually the court -- the court examined the amended petition and concluded that eight claims in the amended petition were unexhausted. The problem is this -- or -- or at least the variance in the facts from what you suggest is this. Mr. Rhines filed an amended petition in November of 2000 with counsel, after having been through all the record. He admitted in his amended petition that four of the claims were unexhausted. He still had 80 days left to run on the statute of limitations. So he conceded in his amended petition in Federal court that he still had 80 days to run -- while there was still 80 days to run on the statute of limitation, that four of the claims he submitted in the petition were unexhausted. That's not difficult to sort out because defense counsel admitted it, as he pled them. And so there isn't tricky question about whether there were unexhausted claims in this petition. Now, that was in November of 2000. He waited until the court decided the decision in July of 2002 and didn't pursue his State court remedies until the court ordered him to do that in July of 2002. And he filed his State habeas to exhaust those admittedly unexhausted claims.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9703 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So that -- that would take care of the four claims. How about the other four?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9704 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it doesn't make any difference at that point, Your Honor. If there's a single, solitary unexhausted claim, the problem --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9705 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, they --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9706 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- is not -- is not worse if there gets to be 12 or 15.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9707 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But those could be -- those could be dropped out of the Federal complaint. There you're saying, district judge, you would be abusing your discretion because admitting that he hadn't exhausted these, he should have gone immediately to do that. But what about the other four?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9708 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, if he -- if he goes within the 80 days and immediately files to pursue in State court his unexhausted claims, the statute is tolled. He doesn't lose the statute.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9709 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Even without going back to the State court, I don't see anything in this statute which indicates that Congress expected everybody who comes into Federal court with unexhausted claims to have time to remedy that defect by running back to State court and -- and filing. This statute doesn't give any such indication. And it's clear that will never happen if he files on the 364th day after the conclusion of the State proceedings. Right? I mean, his year is up already. Even if the judge decides the question the next morning, it's too late. So I -- I don't know why we have to be concerned about giving him some entitled second chance to go back to -- to State court. I don't see anything in the statute that -- that guarantees or that even envisions that. And I -- I --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9710 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I'm sorry, Your Honor.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9711 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But I don't agree with that you were saying or you do agree with that, I know. The -- but the -- the question that I would have is, is there anything the other way? I mean, in Duncan, you know, I was dissenting and the thing that sort of moved me is I couldn't imagine Congress really cared about this. I mean, what they do is they want to have you file within a year. And they say, well, but if you filed within a year and you're in State court, we don't care anymore. You're being -- if you file in the wrong State court, you're tolled. We don't really care once you're proceeding. And now, however, if you go in -- into Federal court by mistake instead of State court by mistake, well, you're out of luck on a random basis. Some judges will get you back in on time. Other judges won't. Is there anything in the history or anywhere -- I -- I'm interested in the history from your point of view, as much as the other. Is there anything that suggests that Congress cared about that?

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9714 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # If that's so, then why isn't a system like the one that the Second Circuit described the most reasonable thing to do, that is, to put very tight deadlines both on the petitioner and on the Federal court, that is, to deny -- deny the stay and abey when the prisoner has not been diligent, to put a tight time line on when that prisoner has to go to State court, and a similarly tight line on returning to the Federal court after the State court is done? And you could check against repeatedly abusing this by saying, and you get only one opportunity to do it.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9715 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think the answer to the question, Your Honor, is that in order to follow the Second Circuit as you've described, this Court would have to rewrite the interpretation of the exhaustion statute that they issued in Rose v. Lundy. That's my belief because Rose v. Lundy -- or the statute, as interpreted by Rose v. Lundy indicates that at a minimum, the unexhausted claims ought to be dismissed without prejudice and sent back for exhaustion in State court.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9716 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But Rose and Lundy also assumed that they could go back to State court and -- and in -- in fact this could be done without wiping out the claims. And the difference between the situation in Rose and Lundy and the situation we've got now is the difference which is focused, I think, in -- in Justice Ginsburg's four claims as to which there was disagreement even between the district court and -- and the State as to whether there was exhaustion. There -- there isn't a -- a -- as a -- as a systemic matter across the United States, there simply isn't a way for most of these people to go back and litigate their State claims. Rose and Lundy assumed there was. Now there isn't.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9717 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, if the petitioner is not capable of going back to litigate the State claim, the claim is not unexhausted by definition. And --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9718 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It may not be -- it -- it will be waived. I mean, if -- if -- on your theory, he -- he jumps from the frying pan of nonexhaustion into the fire of waiver. That's -- that's no answer to the problem.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9719 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # See, you could -- there are two things in Rose v. Lundy, and everybody agrees with the one, you must exhaust in State court. You cannot have the Federal court take a first view of that question. You -- you must exhaust. And -- but then Rose v. Lundy also said without prejudice, and your reading strikes out without prejudice not based on the defendant's conduct, not based on the petitioner's conduct, but because it took the district court more than the limitation period just to sort out which claims were exhausted and which weren't.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9720 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think there are two responses to that, Your Honor. First of all, the -- the fact of whether it is without prejudice in fact or in law is driven by how much time is left on the statute of limitations. A dismissal without prejudice at the time the amended petition was filed in this case would have left 80 days on the statute and he could have pursued his -- his remedy in State court and tolled the statute. Now, in the -- in the more common situation with the habeas petitioner, I think the answer has to be Congress has changed the landscape. They have changed the landscape relying upon the total exhaustion rule in -- that they enacted and that this Court has interpreted. And they have added the statute of limitations and they've added the tolling provisions, and that has to be entered into the computation. Now, I think that that simply raises the bar for all petitioners to make doubly sure that if they have a claim, they have presented it to a State court judge because they -- they --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9721 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, the -- the troublesome thing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you said in South Dakota, go back to the State court a second time, because they had a swift district judge, and some won't because the district judge was slow. So to treat identically situated petitioners differently not because of any lapse on the petitioner's part but solely because one had the luck to get before a swift district judge and the other, the bad luck to get before a procrastinator, that seems arbitrary and not anything that Congress built into the statute.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9723 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, did go. Did. Every one of these cases, I say if they came rushing to the Federal court first, no Federal judge would even consider giving them a stay so they can go to the first -- first time. But these -- these come up where someone has gone to the State court and then they come to the Federal court with a new petition and there's arguments about what they exhausted and what they didn't. I'm -- I'm leaving out the person who never went to the Federal -- State court at all. That person is -- is not the category that this case represents. This case represents the one who goes to State court and comes to the Federal court and has arguably some additional claims.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9724 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The -- there's the -- the difficulty in the stay and abeyance procedure, as it is currently practiced, I think, is that there is no set of standards, other than the three statutes that we've -- that we have discussed, to guide the district court's discretion in when they give stay and abeyance.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9725 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # General Long, do -- do those States that apply stay and abey make a distinction between whether the person who comes with unexhausted claims has exhausted some claims in State court and ones who haven't?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9726 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I think the predicate to getting stay and abeyance, Your Honor, is that there has to be at least the presence of one exhausted claim and one unexhausted --

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9739 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Whereas, if there's one exhausted claim, they could -- they could keep the Federal -- petition in Federal court and stay it and let the unexhausted claim be exhausted.

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9746 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I think this, Your Honor. I -- I think the court, faced with a mixed petition, ought to first ask why have you not -- if -- if there is truly an unexhausted claim in this petition, why did you not present that claim previously in State court. And after that, if -- if the -- if the answer to that is not satisfactory, I think that the -- I think that that ought to be tested on, for example, the cause and prejudice standard or the actual innocence or fundamental miscarriage of justice standards which this Court has announced to cure procedural defaults in extreme cases. But in the absence of those type of standards, I think that stay and abeyance has been simply applied too broadly and this case is a classic example of the misapplication of stay and abeyance.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9747 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, are you suggesting then that we could have a rule, oh, somewhat like the grant of a preliminary injunction?

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9752 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the -- the difficulty with the way it is now, Your Honor, is there is no review of the discretion of the district courts at all. I mean, they simply do it, and --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9753 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I suppose the suggestion I made --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9754 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- and it's --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9755 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- is preferable than the one I gave. Would you adopt that or would you insist just that there be no stay and abey at all?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9756 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, our first position, obviously, is no stay and abey at all, that the unexhausted claims ought to be dismissed, as the Eighth Circuit said in this case. And if they -- if they are truly unexhausted, then there is going to be a remedy in State court, and State courts are perfectly capable of identifying constitutional remedies and -- and meting out the requirements. I've had -- I've had South Dakota judges send murder cases back to me to try after 12 years, and it's -- it's a burdensome thing, and those cases need to move forward. But what I would envision, Justice Kennedy, is this, that the rule ought to be that -- that the -- the -- that the case is sent back to State court if there is truly, as -- as the name implies, an unexhausted claim, implying that there is an available State remedy. If -- if resolution in the State courts does not resolve it, if the case comes back in some fashion, then the court needs to apply some standards like cause and prejudice or fundamental miscarriage of justice, which -- which is what is applied in -- in procedural default cases, and -- and deal with it on that basis. But the -- the current lack of discretion with reference to how stay and abeyance is applied is in my judgment the -- that is the -- that is the most fundamental problem with --

argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9760 # TRUE # MR. LONG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The -- well, the -- the Second Circuit followed very closely to what the -- what the district court did here, Your Honor, but what I did not see in the Second Circuit opinions and frankly haven't seen in any of the opinions except the Eighth Circuit opinion was any type of analysis about an explanation of why the petitioner hadn't been prudent and hadn't been diligent in State court. And -- and in the absence of any kind of inquiry like that, I think that stay and abeyance simply is -- is -- it's unguided. There are no standards. If there are no questions, thank you very much.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9761 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, General Long. Mr. Lange, you have 7 minutes left, and normally I wouldn't intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like to ask you to comment on one thought. Do you think it would be appropriate before a district judge ever grants a stay and -- and abeyance procedure, to make some kind of a preliminary, not exactly a probable cause determination, but some kind of a determination as to whether or not there is arguable merit to the State claim that he wants to stay the proceedings to -- to allow him to exhaust?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9763 # FALSE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, I do, Justice Stevens. I believe that a district court, in evaluating a request for stay and abeyance, should look to make sure that the petition meets the standards of section 2254(b)(2) which is the provision that allows a district court to reach the merits of unexhausted claims to deny them. It's similar to what the Court has now promulgated as rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus cases. I think it makes sense for the district court first to look at -- at whether there's merit to the petition because there really is no sense to hold in abeyance, pending exhaustion in State court, claims that lack merit. Obviously, to get stay and abeyance, the petitioner will have had to file timely within his AEDPA period, and the court will have had to have held the case either through the expiration of the AEDPA period or you can imagine some scenarios where on the 364th day --
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9764 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, it's one thing to say that there's -- it's utterly without merit and he can deny it, which he's entitled to do under the statute. It's another thing to say that there's a high probability of success on the merits. I'm afraid that most of the claims are going to fall in between. The district judge just doesn't know absent testimony, et cetera, et cetera.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9765 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Right, and those should be circumstances where the State court is left to judge whether the claim has merit while the Federal court proceedings are suspended, are abeyed or held in abeyance. It makes sense, under the exhaustion norms of this Court, to let the State courts pass judgment first on claims that have sufficient merit where they can't be disposed of under rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9766 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. -- Mr. Lange, why -- why isn't -- gee, you have Lange and Long. Why isn't Attorney General Long's assertion sensible? That is to say, it's an extraordinary thing to have Federal district courts in all criminal cases reviewing the work of State supreme courts. We -- we got into this in an era when we couldn't trust State supreme courts, especially in racial cases. But that's where we are now. But why is it unreasonable to say, look, you get one shot at coming to Federal court? And if -- if you -- if you bungle that and you haven't exhausted first, we're not denying your claims. Go back to State court. We're just not going to reintervene as Federal courts. Your -- your claims are not dead. Justice is not denied. You just have to go back through the State system and we're not going to blue pencil the work of the State system a second time. That's all. Why isn't that reasonable?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9767 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, this is Mr. Rhines' one opportunity. Congress did give in section 2254(a) jurisdiction to the courts and said the Federal courts shall entertain petitions of this -- of this nature. So this is a -- a right that Mr. Rhines has to have these entertained. He filed timely.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9768 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, to have exhausted claims entertained. Right? Is there some -- do you say there is some absolute right to have the Federal court hear unexhausted claims?
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9769 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, under (b)(1), a claim must be exhausted to support relief from a Federal court. That is right, Your Honor. And these claims -- if under the petitioner B scenario, the court had ruled promptly or the claims were less complex, allowing them to be disposed of earlier, Mr. Rhines could have had or -- and should have all of his claims before the district court to be resolved. The Court needs to be watchful here not to penalize Mr. Rhines and people who are in similar situations because they have complex claims.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9770 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, this is not a pro se petitioner.
argument in Rhines against Weber # 03-9046 # 9771 # TRUE # MR. LANGE # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No. He is represented by counsel, obviously, Your Honor. I -- I think it inappropriate to draw lines between pro se and represented counsel, though, in the realm of habeas. That I think invites trouble. So the rule you formulate is obviously not only for Rhines but for pro se litigants as well that -- that deserve consideration. This exhaustion rule is not to be an -- a trap for the unwary pro se petitioner. The whole purpose of the exhaustion rule, as this Court said in Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, is to -- not to erect a hurdle on the path to Federal habeas court, but to channel claims into an appropriate forum. And stay and abeyance does just that. It prohibits further proceeding on a mixed petition in Federal court and channels, indeed requires, as a term of the order that the petitioner go and exhaust the remaining State remedy and come back to court with one exhausted claim. That is what Rose v. Lundy contemplated and allowed with the dismissal without prejudice.

I mean, you're -- you're saying that one mustn't look behind, in the case of a guilty plea, to find the police report or even the police application for complaint. But there isn't any question, is there, that the police reports in fact gave addresses of particular buildings?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9804 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There is no question of that. When you look at the police reports, if you read those police reports, some of which you can actually read, they do describe buildings and they describe addresses and hallways and things like that.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9805 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So what -- what you're saying is the conviction itself didn't show that, and so the question is whether you can look to documents that in fact showed it.

THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, actually the district court established that this was not on the record at the time of the plea. The district court took evidence on this issue. The statutes to -- that are underlying these convictions, to get back to Justice Scalia's question, are nongeneric, and they are nongeneric in the sense that they make it unlawful to break into structures other than buildings or in addition to buildings.

argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9810 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that calls into question what kinds of documents can be examined in terms of making a -- a determination as to whether this offense was categorically a crime of violence, that is, that it was generic burglary. It's our position that there's a limitation, and the limitation is imposed by Taylor itself, that the question being answered be made a question of law, that it is a question of law, that it's a matter of law that you make the determination.

argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9813 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I -- I don't understand your reading of Taylor. As I've read that case many times, it seemed to me that that was making a perfectly sensible point. At the end of the opinion, Justice Blackmun says, you know, there are some States like Massachusetts, for example, that instead of just saying burglary, they say burglary of a -- of a ship or a car or a building. And that leads us to answer a more general question. Well, in context, that more general question is whether you ought to go look into how a particular burglary was committed to see if there was really violence or not. And he says no. Just look to the definition of the crime. That's what he says. That will end it. Now, he says we agree, because I started here, that we have a couple of States with some weird statutes, and what you have to do in those States is you won't know if it's a boat or a car or -- so he says, for example, in a State like the one we have, if it shows it's charged us with a burglary and you have to find out, you know, here's what you do. It says you may have to go beyond the mere fact of conviction. So he says go look to the indictment or information and jury instructions. That isn't a limiting phrase. That's for example. He just thought that in those cases, that's what -- all you'll have to look to, for example. We happen to have an unusual case where there are no jury instructions because he pled guilty. So what's the harm of going looking to the documents that will show, in an uncontested way, just what the address on these pieces of paper show? There are no boats, you know, in Watertown. It's not a dock, I don't think, or at least not in that part of it. So -- so I mean, what's the problem here?

THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The example that's given, the charging document and jury instructions -- let's suppose that instead of -- of guilty pleas, Mr. Shepard was tried and he was tried on this nongeneric, boiler plate complaint, and there were no jury instructions available.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9817 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What's the problem? I grant you I could imagine a case that could be a problem. Maybe it was a houseboat. Okay? (Laughter.)
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9818 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Or maybe it's like a trailer. So if we run into that case, we'll deal with it. You know, I'm perfectly capable of thinking that if this is a charge where there is a dispute on the contested point, fine, we won't take that dispute into account, maybe decide it in the favor of the defendant, maybe. But this is not that case. And by the way, if he's going to say, how do you know? I'd say, I know. I know Boston and I also know that breaking into a boat at least is unusual. So if he thinks it wasn't that, let him say so.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9819 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The district court did actually entertain this issue, Justice Breyer, and what they -- what the district court found was there wasn't an opportunity, there wasn't a reason for Mr. Shepard to contest building or any other element of this offense.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9820 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No, of course, there wasn't. So all he has to do now is say, Judge, in my latest thing, you know, they say 30 Bremer Street. 30 Bremer Street sounds like the address of a building, but by the way, unusually enough, it's the license plate of a car. Now, if in fact that's the case, he can come in and say it. There's no Fifth Amendment problem. We're talking about sentencing and what a prior conviction was. He doesn't even have to say it. You as his lawyer could tell us. Now, you know why I think you don't say it? Because it isn't conceivably right.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9821 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, and it also isn't in fact. And the question here is --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9822 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What do you mean it isn't right in fact? What is it?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9823 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Is it in law --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9824 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9825 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- or in fact that we are trying to make this determination?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9826 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # We look to facts about what the prior convictions were about. That's what Taylor says. That, of course, is a fact, but it's a legal fact, what was this conviction for.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9827 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Taylor said you don't look at facts --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9828 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I understand your reading of it. What I want to know is what's wrong with my reading of it.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9829 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because your reading of it requires a look at the underlying conduct. It actually requires. And the document here that was selected to exhibit the underlying conduct is as far away as you can get from an adjudicatory document.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9830 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # All right. What -- is -- is your argument that we are likely, in effect, to -- to violate some constitutional standard if we do what the Government wants, or is your argument as follows? That Taylor says this is an offense-based not a fact-based determination. Taylor says that's what the statute is getting at. And if you go as far as the Government wants here, you basically will have gone beyond offense-based. You will have gone -- become fact-based and you will be violating the statute. So my question is, is there something constitutionally we have to worry about which is the basis for your argument, or is it a violation of the statute that you think we ought to be worried about?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9831 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In this case it's the statute that was violated, but you are correct, Justice Souter --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9832 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I don't have a position. I can't --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9833 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- that -- no. You are correct in representing that the Government's approach to this will take what is quintessentially a question of law, that is, a comparison of adjudicated elements of -- adjudicated elements of conviction against -- compared to the elements of generic burglary. That's a question of law. Do they match? Do they not match? It becomes a question of fact then, as the First Circuit put it in Shepard and in the Harris case, to determine what was actually in the mind of the defendant at the time he entered his plea.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9834 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, aren't we asking that question in -- in any case? The question ultimately is, what did he mean when he said I am guilty? If you've got a plea colloquy, as you admitted a moment ago, it's easy to find out what he meant because they would have gone into the factual basis for the plea. If there's a written plea agreement, it's probably going to be easy to find out because, again, there would be a basis for the plea set out. Here, there isn't one of those documents. So you're going one step further, but you're still asking the question what did he mean when he stood in that courtroom and said I am guilty. And yes, in -- in one sense that's fact-based, but all of those questions are fact-based. They're going to the same issue. What did he mean? What was pleading guilty to? Isn't that correct?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9835 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, because it's based on an examination of the underlying conduct, which is forbidden by the Taylor decision --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9836 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, maybe, maybe not. That's kind of the question we have, how -- what gloss to put on Taylor.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9837 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Suppose --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9838 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Do you join the amici in saying Almendarez-Torres has to be overruled?

argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9842 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But suppose --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9843 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # All right. So we're looking --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9844 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- Taylor were not on the books. What -- what would be the basis of your argument? You say that it's all right to look at a plea colloquy, but it's not all right to look at an arrest report to which the judge referred. What's the basis for that distinction? What sense does it make?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9845 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The sense it makes it this. What the Armed Career Criminal Act addresses and what this Court discussed in Taylor was the applicable term is conviction, that is, a conviction for a categorical offense. The categorical offense is a crime of violence specifically described as burglary, arson, but there are specifically described crimes. Those are things that you can determine as a matter of law. Do the elements match the -- the generically violent crime, or do they not match the generically violent crime? If they do not match the generically violent crime, you might still be able to figure out, you might be able to surmise what the defendant actually had in his mind, if he had anything in his mind, about this at the time of the guilty plea. Well, one of the unique things about the -- these nongeneric burglary statutes in Massachusetts is that they're really relatively petty offenses.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9846 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But -- but why can you look at what's in the plea colloquy that's in the record, but you cannot look at a document that the judge referred to, if that document isn't there? What's -- what's the common sense argument that you're making? I -- I don't understand it.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9847 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there is no evidence in this case that the judge referred to a police report.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9848 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No. This is my little hypothetical case so that we can test your theory, just to see the reasons that you're advancing for -- for us to rule in your favor. And I -- I don't see any rationale that you've given us.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9849 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If you can look at the colloquy and the judge, without incorporating it, has the defendant explicitly admit the facts that constitute the elements of generic burglary, it is our position that that -- that conviction could be used to enhance. But --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9850 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Let me try the same question.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9851 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But -- but why can't you go one step further and refer to the document that was not in the record but that the judge mentioned in his -- in his findings at the first sentencing? Why? I still haven't had a reason why.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9852 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I agree that whether or not that document is in the record, if there is an explicit finding or an admission by the court that enters the judgment, that the defendant broke and entered a building, that that conviction should be able to qualify as a predicate under the Armed Career Criminal Act. It is not a requirement that the underlying document be incorporated into the record, only that the admission be made or the facts be found by the fact-finder, whoever is taking the plea.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9853 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # May I ask you a question? Assume the case had been tried and you could not tell from either the indictment or the instructions to the jury whether it was a generic burglary or a nongeneric burglary. Would the -- our decision permit us to look at the transcript of the trial to answer that question?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9854 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Certainly not under Taylor. The whole idea of Taylor was partly dictated by the words of the statute.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9855 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So your argument is that this is comparable to using the transcript of the trial.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9856 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This is -- it -- well, I don't think it's comparable because the district court finding was that the documents that the Government relies on were not involved in the adjudication at all. So it --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9857 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So this is even farther removed.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9858 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # This is even farther removed than a plea colloquy, farther removed than a trial transcript looking into the evidence --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9859 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But that's what I don't understand. We're now talking about that part of Taylor which deals with a narrow statute where our object is not to find out what he's guilty of or anything. We're just trying to find out what was the crime he was charged with. And there are two or three States which lump together in one statute crimes that are violent and nonviolent. Burglary of a structure is violent. Burglary of a car or a ship is not. So all we want to know is what was the charge at issue. Now, do you -- let me break the question into two parts. The key sentence here, I think, is for example, in a State whose burglary statutes include entry of an automobile, as well as a building, if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with burglary of a building, then it's going to be violent. Now, would you -- would you agree with me or not that he could have written -- Justice Blackmun -- that same sentence to say if, for example, the indictment or information and jury instructions show? Would you be willing to add those two words, for example?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9860 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If, for example.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9861 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # If, for example. I want to know how -- how absolute you're making this. If, for example. And the next question I'd ask would be if you agree for example, what are the things you can look to and what are the things you can't?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9862 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And I -- I do agree that that's one of the questions presented by this case.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9863 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes, but do you want add the for example or do you want to take it just categorically?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9864 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I do believe that the best reading is the categorical reading.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9865 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9866 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But I'm willing to accept for example --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9867 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Okay. Then what kinds of things would you --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9868 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- for purposes of argument.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9869 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- let us look to and what kinds of things not? All we're interested in is what was he charged with, which of these three things.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9870 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And all Taylor and the Armed Career Criminal Act are interested in is what was he convicted of.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9871 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No, no, no. I will get that later. Let me deal with the charge. If he was charged with breaking into a boat, that's the end of this. Okay?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9872 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # True.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9873 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So, fine. So I want to know what he was charged with. Let me do that one. Now, what will you let me look to to see what he was charged with?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9874 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # You can look to the charging document and the statute to see what he was charged with.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9875 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # All right. So what happens in the case where -- Justice Blackmun let us go further than that. He says the indictment -- that's the charging document -- or information and jury instruction. He'll let us look to a jury instruction as if there's actually been a trial. So he'll let us go further than you will.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9876 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Not to determine what he was charged with. To determine what he was convicted of. Because the jury instructions are not going to be factually oriented. The jury instructions are going to tell you what the element of the crime was, elements that were adjudicated. So that if you have the person charged with a nongeneric document here -- the nongeneric statute, a boat, a house, a whatever, and the jury instructions establish for you that he could not have been convicted by that jury without finding a house because that's the elements laid out in the jury instruction --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9877 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And what's the difference between that and a police report that makes it quite clear that in the circumstances there was no possibility of a boat or a car being involved? What's the difference between that and the police report?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9878 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The police report does not show you what the results of the adjudication was. It does not establish --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9879 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # No. What shows us that -- what shows us that is --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9880 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The elements.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9881 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- is the check mark. No. The check mark on the form that says, for example, plea, admit sufficient facts. You know, that's a check mark or it's on the form. It says plea, guilty. I mean, you know, you could have different things checked. So that's what established the guilt. And then the police report establishes whether -- what kind of a thing was at issue. And I will agree with you that if it's at all contested, we shouldn't get into it. But if it's not contested, there's no question. There was no boat around there. It's a city street. Or there was no car. It's plain it was a building. Then that's just as good as the jury instruction. Why not? Tell me why not.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9882 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I suggest that it doesn't tell you anything about what's actually been adjudicated. What it tells you, it's what's actually been charged. And here's one of the things that came up in the district court in front of Judge Gertner, and the Government brought up this as well as Judge -- as the district court judge. What if Mr. Shepard went in and said, yes, I broke into the property of another person with intent to commit a crime? That would be a factual basis that would be adequate for the -- for any sentence that could be imposed under that statute. Because the -- because of the fact that the boat, the house, the car, and the vessel are all put on the same level, the operative fact is is it yours, Mr. Shepard. Does that belong to you, Mr. Shepard?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9883 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I mean, but that's always true. You could have a -- you could have a -- a sheet that shows: admitted, assault, you know. And -- and what the sheet says, it says: charge, assault; plea, guilty. It's possible, for all we know, that when the actual colloquy took place, he was talking about some other thing. I don't know what he was talking about, but what you'd go upon is that there was a charge and he pleaded guilty to the charge.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9884 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Which brings me to Henderson against Morgan. One of the issues in Henderson against Morgan is whether or not you can infer guilt of an element that is not specifically charged even from overwhelming evidence, that that could be proved.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9885 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I -- I don't -- good. Are you going to explain this? Because I thought what we were supposed to do is just look to the sheet, charge; the plea, guilty. And that is what we do and it disposes of 98 percent of the cases.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9886 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It does.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9887 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # All right. So -- so are you talking about those 98 percent now?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9888 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm talking about the -- the 2 percent that are nongeneric burglary. And in those 2 percent that are nongeneric burglary, the issue that is raised, by the fact that it's nongeneric burglary, is you can't make a determination based on the face of the record of what was actually adjudicated, that this person was actually found guilty of each element of generic burglary. And when you cannot make that determination from record documents and contemporaneous documents with the adjudication, then you cannot make that determination under the Armed Career Criminal Act.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9889 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why can't you make the determination? Isn't the -- the problem that your determination may not be as reliable? And I thought ultimately your argument would boil down to saying this. The reason you will accept the plea colloquy or the plea agreement, if it sets out the facts, is that that is very reliable. It is a reliable indication of what he was pleading guilty to and what the court was finding him guilty of. But once you go beyond that and you start looking into police reports appended to complaints or whatnot, you're getting into an area of less reliability, and when we're dealing with sentence enhancements like this, we better be reliable. That's why the statute based it on -- on offense rather than facts. Don't get into a factual determination that is unreliable. I thought that was your argument ultimately.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9890 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That -- that is part of the argument, and I -- I think that we're just using different terms here. You're using offense, and -- and the Taylor court and the -- and the Armed Career Criminal Act use conviction.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9891 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I -- I'll accept that, yes.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9892 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Okay. And so when you're talking about a conviction, you're talking about something that has already been established, that you should be able to make a determination by looking at the contemporaneous documents.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9893 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But you -- you still haven't given a reason, other than the one Justice Souter accepts. Look it. This is a case where we all know what the truth is, but you want to argue that we shouldn't find that out. And it seems to me you have to give us a rationale for we shouldn't know the truth here. You -- you don't want us to find it, and there must be some reasons for that. And the law does that once in a while. We all know that something happened, but the law is supposed to pretend it didn't. That's why Justice has a blindfold on. I -- I know that. But you haven't given me one reason yet why I should adopt your theory.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9894 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the theory that I'm proposing is -- is I believe the theory that's already been adopted by this Court, which is the -- the one described in Taylor. It's the categorical approach that says you cannot make a determination of what elements were adjudicated by looking at the underlying conduct.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9895 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But why is a categorical determination important? I threw you a -- a bone a second ago, and I said maybe it's because of --

argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9897 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- a reliability concern. Is that it? Is that your point?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9898 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It is reliable and it's also not fact-based. Once you start to --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9899 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # No, but is -- is your point that once you get beyond the documents that you admit we can look at, there is a higher -- an -- an unacceptably high risk of unreliability? Is that your argument?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9900 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That is one of my arguments, Justice Souter, and the -- and there's something that goes hand in glove with that and did in this case. The burden shifts then to the defendant. The burden shifts to the defendant to prove that he was not convicted of generic burglary, and that --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9901 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, but that -- that doesn't necessarily follow.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9902 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- assignment --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9903 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But that doesn't necessarily follow from -- from looking at a police report. It may well be that we would say the burden never shifts, and he is simply in the position of any other party to a case. If -- if the other side has put in evidence that is -- is against his interest and he does nothing, then he's in trouble. But that isn't the same as shifting the burden.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9904 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, it --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9905 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # There's no -- I guess all I'm saying is it doesn't follow from the argument that the Government is making that a burden of persuasion shifts. Isn't that correct?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9906 # TRUE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # What shifts is the risk of being wrong. The shifts -- the risk of being wrong right now is on the Government. If the Government cannot establish that the defendant was convicted of generic burglary, it bears that responsibility.

argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9912 # FALSE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: When a defendant has been convicted under a State statute that prohibits both burglary of a building and burglary of a car or some other item, the Court can still look to the conviction to determine whether it is an Armed Career Criminal Act predicate when, as here, the police report indicates the defendant was arrested for burglarizing a building rather than a ship or a car and the other documents in the file corroborate that the basis for the plea was the crime outlined in the police report. Because two of the three elements of generic burglary -- that is, breaking and entering and intent to commit a crime --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9913 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # May I ask this question? Suppose the police report had been ambiguous and referred to both a boat and a house. What would -- could -- would it be -- what would you do in that case?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9914 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think in a case where the police report was ambiguous about what it is that the person broke into, I think that you could not base the enhancement on that. We are asking only when both the police report is unambiguous and the documents recording the guilty plea suggest --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9915 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But why -- why couldn't you use it in the other case? Couldn't you ask the police officer what he -- who conducted the investigation what the facts really were?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9916 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think you might be able to --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9917 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And you'd start out with the premise that 90 percent of these cases are really houses anyway, so there's a strong presumption in favor of the Government?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9918 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I think that you could talk about introducing extrinsic evidence of -- of that sort. We're not asking the Court to go that far, and I think in the run-up cases --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9919 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So the -- the question in this case is whether a police report is extrinsic evidence, isn't it?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9920 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think so in this case because the police report is in -- in a police file itself.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9921 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, suppose that it was an assault and battery, for example, and you're trying to decide whether it was violent or not, and the police report was somewhat ambiguous. Could you -- you couldn't look at it then.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9922 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, and I don't think you could for an additional reason, which is that I don't think assault and battery is necessarily a -- is a necessary element of the -- of -- of -- I'm sorry.

argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9924 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Right, violent and nonviolent.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9925 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- nonviolent assaults.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9926 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Exactly right.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9927 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And you might want to find out which one it was and -- and as here, it seems pretty easy. Everybody knows most burglaries are -- are of houses. But I'm just wondering if we're not trying to find out what the categorical rule is that -- that is at stake here.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9928 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The only rule we are advocating is that when we are talking about a necessary element of the offense that can be satisfied in different ways, that you can look to the police report to indicate which way it was met in this case if the rest of the file, the State court file, indicates that the police report was the -- provided the factual basis or provided the basis for the conviction. And I think if you look at the file in this case, for example, for four of the defendant's --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9929 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, you say it provided the basis for the conviction. Was it presented to the court in each of these cases?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9930 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # We believe that the record indicates that it was. For four of the defendant's convictions, if you look at the document that records the guilty plea, it -- it says -- in addition to the notation of guilty, and as Justice Breyer averred, a check of admit sufficient facts or that there are sufficient facts present, it lists the same date of the offense, the same street address, the same arresting officer, and the same victim. And it is our submission that that implies certainly very strongly -- it supports a very strong inference -- that the crime of conviction was the very same crime that is described in the police report.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9931 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I thought Judge Gertner said she didn't know whether anybody had seen this police report. It wasn't attached to the charge. I thought that was her position, that these are untested documents. We don't know one way or another whether the judge that accepted the plea had seen them.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9932 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # To begin with, Judge Gertner looked only to -- she didn't draw any inference based on the document recording the guilty plea and what happened. She looked only to the direct evidence of what happened in the colloquy, i.e., the petitioner's affidavit. But even more than that, her only finding was that the police report, as a police report, was not introduced at the plea colloquy. It wasn't marked as an exhibit. It wasn't attached to anything. It wasn't introduced as that. I don't think that's inconsistent with the idea that as is often the case and is probably usually the case, that the police report was synopsized by the prosecutor and -- and read at court, which would explain why the offense of conviction has the same offense date, same street address, same victim, same arresting officer.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9933 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But we don't have any colloquy. We don't know what happened at the -- you're saying it's -- it's altogether likely that that happened, but we don't know.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9934 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But we do know that under Massachusetts State law, that there -- before a court can accept a guilty plea, there has to be a factual basis in the record. There have to be facts in the record to support every element of the offense.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9935 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So if the defendant says, yes, I plead guilty to this crime and the crime is described as ship, vessel, car, building, and that's -- if that's all that happened is the boiler plate charge that just repeats the statute and the defendant says, yes, I did that, but nothing tells us did what, other than violate the statute.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9936 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The requirement -- the factual basis requirement requires a statement of the facts, not a statement of the legal conclusion, and simply reading the charging document as a legal conclusion about what it -- about a boat, building, et cetera was broken into. What it requires is a narrative description of the underlying conduct so that the judge can satisfy him or herself to what the defendant is pleading guilty to is actually a crime. If he just says, I agree with the charging document, if the underlying facts were he broke into a grocery cart or a -- a refrigerator shipping box or something, it might not satisfy the elements of the crime.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9937 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But couldn't the judge in that colloquy have said to him, did you break into a building, a car, or a boat? And he would have said yes, and wouldn't that have satisfied the element of the crime?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9938 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't -- I don't think it would have satisfied the factual basis requirement in that there has to be a narrative description of what the defendant did, like he showed up at that day and he broke into 258 Norwell Street. And I have yet to find a Massachusetts case where a -- a guilty plea was accepted based on basically just a recitation of the charging document --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9939 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Now, there's no record here of the colloquy at the plea? Is that it?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9940 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. There's -- there's no facts -- there's no -- as is the case often in guilty pleas, which are not challenged on appeal, no colloquy was ever prepared and apparently the tape recording was destroyed.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9941 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But your test is whether or not there's reliable record evidence? Is that -- that the test?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9942 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, whether there's reliable record evidence that is reliable in describing what the offense was that was the subject of the plea colloquy. And in this case, we believe it is met both because the police report is unambiguous, as several of the members of the Court have averred to, and that the documents recording the guilty plea I think very clearly indicate that the thing that was at issue was the crime described in the police report.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9943 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Does it -- does the plea refer to the police report?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9944 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, it does not. It doesn't in so many words refer to the police report, but it refers to -- it -- it, I think, unambiguously describes the crimes described in the police report and that it involves, as I said, the same date, the same street address, the same victim, and the same arresting officer.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9945 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Where do you draw the line? Is there some -- I -- I take it that you say certainly if the plea colloquy or the -- or the judge's guilt determination refers to the police report, then the police report comes in. Suppose there's no reference to the police report.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9946 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9947 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Can we still go find the police report and then where do we stop?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9948 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that if there's no reference to the police report and if the police report is not in the State court file, which it was in this case -- the court indicated it was in the State court file -- I -- I think that you would probably have to have a stronger showing in order to say, well, he pleaded guilty to the police report such as a -- a reference to the police report or more of an indication on the guilty plea form, a notation of -- of what was entered or --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9949 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, you mentioned --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9950 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- something that unambiguously indicated the police report provided the factual basis for the plea.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9951 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # You -- you mentioned the State file. Is -- is the rule whatever is in the State file, even if there's no reference to it? You had -- you had two variables: one that there was reference to it; and two, that it was in State file. Suppose there's no reference, but it is in the State file. What -- I'm -- I'm not sure what rule you would draw?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9952 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The -- if -- I -- I think that there has to be both an -- that the police report is unambiguous and that there is reason to believe or that it is more likely than not that the police report provided the factual basis for the plea, and if it's -- if there's no reference to it in so many words, I think the same could be said this -- that the same could be said here in this case. It doesn't say we look to the police report. You just draw that inference from the fact that the crime described looks like the crime described in the police report.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9953 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So what is your -- what rule would you have here? The question is, was he convicted of a crime of violence? 98 percent of the cases, all you have to do is look to the crime charged, burglary, and the fact that he was convicted. He pleaded guilty or didn't. But there are these two -- three States I guess that lump together in one code provision for breaking and entering into a ship or a car or a house. So now we've got to know which of the three it is. If they go to trial, it's easy. Just look to the jury instructions. If they plead guilty, I guess your opponents would say that's the end of it. You can't use it because we don't ever know from the charge itself which of the three it was that was at issue. Was a house at issue? Was a car at issue? Was a boat at issue? Now, you're going to say, but do a little investigating to find out what was at issue. Look at the police report. Is your view look at anything as long as it's uncontested and clear? Their argument is no matter what you look into, once you go beyond that charging document, you're going to find I think Justice Souter's point. It's going to be ambiguous sometimes. You get into facts of things happened years ago. It's just not worth it.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9954 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think our argument -- or the -- the proposition that we are arguing for today is that when the documents and the State court file indicate that the defendant was arrested for only burglary of a building and there's no question that it wasn't a ship or a vehicle, that it will support the ACCA --

argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9963 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that in this case it just -- I don't think the Court really has to get to the outer reaches of this because in many of these cases, it's overwhelming --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9964 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But if we don't get to the outer reaches, the next case I suppose will involve a -- an application for a search warrant or an arrest warrant which describes facts and pretty well tells you what really happened. Could you rely on that?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9965 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. Because the -- the important thing is not just describing what actually happened, but what -- what happened on the day the guilty plea was taken. And that is where the documents that record the plea I think come in to show --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9966 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, the police report wasn't made on that date. The police report was prepared earlier, I assume.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9967 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The police report was prepared earlier, but when the crime -- when they wrote down guilty, the offense he was guilty of is breaking into a certain address at a certain day, belonging to a certain victim, and involving the same arresting officer. And we believe that --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9968 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But if it's that -- if it's that explicit, I don't think you need the police report.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9969 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, perhaps because you can refer to the police report.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9970 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It seems to me we're dealing with a case in which the court documents are sufficiently ambiguous that you have to look to something else.

I -- I mean, are we going to imagine an entirely different case out of the blue from the one that's disclosed in -- in the warrant application? It seems to me that there's a -- a relatively high degree of probability there.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9977 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # If -- I -- I think that if the documents recording the guilty plea indicate that the -- that the crime described is the crime described in the warrant application, you probably could look at that if -- to determine if it was a boat or a building or --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9978 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, let's say the warrant application says, you know, we're looking for a stolen radio and the charge does indicate that he was -- that -- that the -- that the property taken in the burglary was a -- was -- was a radio. Wouldn't that be a basis for saying, okay, the warrant application probably discloses what was going on here? If -- if the -- if it was a radio on the warrant application, a radio in the burglary charge to which he did plead guilty, probably it's the radio at the address indicated in the warrant application. Isn't that a fair inference?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 9979 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Perhaps. The -- the whole thing about the warrant application, though, strikes me as -- as a little bit more attenuated, though, also because it's done in advance of the police arriving on the scene and discovering what's going on whereas the police report --

I.e, that it was a house at such and such Shaw Street. That gives you your contemporaneity element. Why not accept that?

Maybe the whole categorical approach is unwise. It may have been more strict than it should be. But it -- I'm puzzled by the notion that in a case that's been tried to verdict, you can only look at the indictment and the instructions, as I understand Justice Blackmun's opinion. You could not look at the testimony in the record, even though there are nine witnesses who described what happened. It seems to me that might be much more reliable than a police report. And I'm just wondering am I correct, do you think, on saying you cannot look at the testimony in the tried case?

But I think that if you were going -- it's still possible to draw the distinction based on an administrability factor, which is the way many courts have looked at it, which is you don't want to have to have the court look back to transcripts of the whole thing versus -- for the whole trial, whereas if they can look at a discrete body of documents and say yes, this guy pleaded guilty to burglary of a building, that you can reach that conclusion. It's a line of administrability, not a -- a line of testimony with the documents.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10000 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The thing I'm just questioning is whether this rule that you -- you're advocating is really more administrable than one that just says it seems crazy in this particular case. But -- but in the interest of having a categorical administrative rule, we'll simply say whatever the public record shows and the proceedings themselves.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10001 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think that it has proven administrable. And it -- it -- I think that the majority of courts allow you to look at court documents in order to determine what was -- what sort of offense was at issue and -- and that --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10002 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # How should we interpret Taylor? Do you -- do you agree with the interpretation suggested this morning by Justice Breyer, for example?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10003 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think it's definitely should be interpreted to include guilty pleas because taking Taylor literally, I mean, they only discussed jury trials. But every court with criminal jurisdiction, every court of appeals with criminal jurisdiction, has concluded that it includes guilty pleas. And so I think it -- it does make sense. I don't think that the Court would have in such a short section of the opinion have exhaustively addressed the entire scope of factual situations, and I don't think it would have addressed the circumstance under which most guilty pleas -- or rather, under which most convictions are obtained --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10004 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, then -- but reading it that way, which is arguable, this case, but reading it that way, you'd say you can look -- what we're interested in is not what happened. We are interested in what kind of a crime was at issue. And where it's difficult to decide what crime is at issue, you can look to whatever official documents are there at the time, any court records, to make that determination, but there -- if there is any indication that they're -- they're contested, if there's any dispute as to what was at issue, then you can't count it. Then it doesn't count. What about that as a rule?
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10005 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I think that is a sensible rule. I mean, basically our rule --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10006 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So you'd say there's -- you can look to what Justice Stevens says. You can look to what is official in that record that seems to have indication of reliability, and if there is any indication at all that this was a matter in dispute, you can't count the conviction. That would be the rule.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10007 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I think that would be a sensible rule. And in this case, as -- as we indicated, not only are the police reports unambiguous, but there's a very strong reason to believe that they were the basis for the guilty plea as it was obtained on that day.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10008 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Mr. Elwood, we had a case last term involving a search warrant, Groh against Ramirez, and it -- it was very clear that the application for the warrant identified specifically what the police were to search for, but the warrant itself didn't. And this Court held you couldn't look behind that blank warrant for the particulars that were revealed in the warrant application. And I suppose this is similar in the sense that we have the conviction and you're saying, but you can look behind that conviction to something that, we don't know, may or may not have been before the court.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10009 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # As I recall Groh, that case specifically turned on the fact that the face of the Fourth Amendment requires that the warrant describe, not that the supporting documents describe, the place to be searched and the items to be seized. And I think in this case we already know it's okay to look behind convictions because Taylor itself says so. The only question is what items are acceptable, and --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10010 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, Taylor -- Taylor doesn't quite have this full for example because there's another paragraph following the for example paragraph which says we hold an offense constitutes burglary for purposes of 924(e) if either the statutory definition corresponds to generic burglary, which it doesn't here, or the charging paper, which it doesn't here, and jury instructions, which the judge tells the jury you must find this in order to convict. Those are not for examples. That paragraph says you've got three things you can look to. You can look to the statutory definition. You can look to the charging paper, and you can look to the jury instruction. And that's it.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10011 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I think, though, that in the context that -- that is, if you're going to include guilty pleas at all for these sort of straddle offenses that -- that some of the conduct is generic burglary and some isn't, that if Taylor is accepted on face value, where it isn't an example, then it -- it basically would mean that, sub silentio, the -- the Court had held that guilty pleas could not be used at all for this sort of inquiry under the Armed Career Criminal Act, which I think would be extraordinarily or -- or it would definitely limit at least the utility of the ACCA as an act punishing recidivism because the vast majority of convictions are obtained through criminal --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10012 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but aren't the vast majority of guilty pleas unambiguous? This is a rather rare case.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10013 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But if the -- I don't think -- I think that whenever there is a straddle crime and that the charging document is --
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10014 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, whenever straddle crimes, but -- but they're the exception rather than the rule.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10015 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is probably the case. I know that there are something like 28 States that have them.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10016 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But even burglary I think in most States would be clear.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10017 # TRUE # MR. ELWOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There -- there are many States that -- that have offenses that include both generic and nongeneric burglary, although I think that it's probably true that most -- most burglary statutes are either generic or nongeneric, not sort of straddled like that. But in any event, I think it would significantly limit the utility of the ACCA. And in addition, every court of appeals with criminal jurisdiction has held that that's not what it means, that it does mean, as Justice Breyer indicated, that that was one example that the Court meant. It is, after all, a fairly abbreviated discussion that wasn't briefed by the parties in the case, and I don't think that the Court should read it so expansively based on relatively ambiguous language. If there are no further questions from the Court, we'll rely on our submission.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10018 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Elwood. Ms. Thompson, you have a little over 3 minutes.
argument in Shepard against the United States # 03-9168 # 10020 # FALSE # MS. THOMPSON # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Justice Stevens. First, I would like to point out that the Armed Career Criminal Act does not punish all recidivism. It is designed to punish the people who have prior convictions for those offenses falling -- falling within the categories. So it's not designed to punish all recidivism. Massachusetts does have generic burglary statutes. These statutes that are at issue here are not among them. But for the serious forms of burglary, such as home invasion, Massachusetts punishes those under generic burglary statutes. So those do exist. With regard to the record that the Court can look at in making this determination, it was significant in the district court that Judge Gertner was not pointed to the face of the complaint. And as you look at the complaints that are shown in the third appendix in this case, there is -- there are dates listed at the bottom. The entries in those docket sheets were made at different times, not all made at the time of a guilty plea. The Government did not present any evidence to help the court understand anything about the way the dockets were made and the entries were made when a guilty plea was taken in the district court. The third thing of interest is, as Judge Gertner found, there was no reason for a contemporaneous contest of the evidence -- of the material in the police report because the police report was not part of the plea proceeding. So what happens is the district court that's faced with the sentencing issue now has to make the determination, can I now look and see whether there was some contest years ago when the guilty plea was entered without the aid of a contemporaneous record of adjudication. And what Mr. Shepard's position is, as to what the -- the rule should be, is that where -- and we don't contest even remotely that guilty pleas don't fall under the ambit of the Armed Career Criminal Act. Taylor was a guilty plea itself. That case was a guilty plea -- is that where you have a nongeneric statute and you have a conviction by a guilty plea, that the court can look at a charging document and a contemporaneous formal record of adjudication, not simply anything that's found in the court file, and that must establish, based on that examination, that the defendant was necessarily found guilty of all the elements of generic burglary either by his own admission or by a finding by the judge. Thank you.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10027 # FALSE # MS. MADIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This Court has made clear on several occasions, including 21 years ago in Place and 4 years ago in Edmond, that a sniff by a drug-detection dog is not a Fourth Amendment search, and if something is neither a search nor a seizure, then it requires no Fourth Amendment justification.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10028 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, we've held that it's certainly not a -- a full-blown search. It's not a search in the classic sense, but a Terry stop isn't an arrest in -- in the classic sense either. We -- we have said that that is a kind of seizure. Why do -- I think your -- your argument assumes that this for -- for purposes of search analogies that something is either a -- a full-dress search or it's not a search at all. Why isn't there a -- a possibility of -- of a kind of middle ground on searches just as there is on seizures?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10029 # TRUE # MS. MADIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, this Court made clear in Arizona v. Hicks that it did not want to go down the road of creating something known as a quasi-search so that courts and police officers would be in the position of trying to determine whether or not something was a search or not.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10030 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Oh, I -- I can -- I can just imagine the problems, but I mean, what -- I think what's -- what the -- what's bothering me about the case is that if we persist in -- in saying that -- that it's -- that it's an either and or question with no question with no possible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the police from taking the dogs through every municipal garage in the United States and I suppose there's nothing that prevents the police from taking the dogs up to any homeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog gets a sniff of something when the door is opened. We're -- we're opening rather a -- a large vista for -- for dog intrusions, and -- and that's what's -- that's what's bothering me. Why -- why should we -- why should we open that vista if there is a possibility of a -- of a middle ground that would prevent it?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10031 # TRUE # MS. MADIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I would start with the reality that dog sniffs by their very nature, as this Court recognized in both Place and Edmond, are very unique both in terms of the manner in which the sniff is conducted, as well as the content of -- of the information that the sniff reveals, so that a dog sniff is only going to be able to reveal the presence or absence of contraband. And this Court has recognized that individuals have no privacy interest in the possession of contraband.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10032 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Does that imply that your answer is yes to the question? If we say, as you urge, a dog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to parade up and down every street in the country with dogs sniffing car trunks.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10033 # TRUE # MS. MADIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes. Because a sniff is not a search, a police officer would be able to take a narcotics-detection dog down the street with him or her. I can tell you that because of the limited resources -- and this is a point brought up in the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police amicus brief -- that that is not likely to occur. In addition, I can also tell you that in the State of Illinois, the Illinois State police do not train their dogs nor do they use their dogs on people. They only use them on objects. But yes, in answer to both of your questions, because a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs could be used to walk down streets. They could, hypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they are used in parking lots.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10034 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But they are used. I mean, we don't have to make it up. From cases we've had here, we know that they're used in places like bus depots to -- to sniff luggage that -- that passengers have carried through on -- on buses.

Now, but -- but this is not a new technology. This is a dog and -- and they had that ability in 1791 just as they had it today. And the rule that when there's no intrusion, there's no search -- there's no reason to depart from that rule with respect to a dog although there would be with respect to some sophisticated new technology that would enable you to find out all sorts of things.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10130 # TRUE # MR. WRAY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Kennedy, I cannot, I regret to say, tell you what dogs were doing in 1790. I can tell you -- and this is maybe a factual thing that might be of interest to the Court -- that the dogs who train -- who are trained to alert to detect things -- it's not that they are sniffing things that all dogs can't already smell. It's rather that they are trained to let the handler know that they've smelt whatever it is they've been trained to smell. So the smells that are coming out of Respondent Caballes' car are exposed to every dog.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10142 # TRUE # MR. WRAY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We would -- we would submit this is not a search because, as this Court recognized in both Place and Edmond -- and the Jacobsen case is also significant because the Court said that the reason this is not a search, there using the dog sniff by analogy, is because it compromises no legitimate privacy interest. The language of the Court in Place is significant because it says that we are aware of no other investigative procedure that is so limited in both the manner in which the information is obtained and in the content of the information revealed. That language goes not only to why it's not a Fourth Amendment search but why the use of the dog sniff during a probable cause traffic stop here, where it doesn't prolong the duration, does not transform an otherwise lawful seizure into an unlawful one.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10143 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # All right. Do you -- do you think it's -- it's reasonable to say that if the police take dogs simply onto private property to sniff the foundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door and ring the bell so that they hope the door will open, that there is -- there is no compromise of a privacy interest?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10144 # TRUE # MR. WRAY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there would be a question as to whether the officer, the human officer, that is, could be on private property -- I take it from your hypothetical, Justice Souter -- in the first place. But --
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10145 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, I mean, the Fourth Amendment analysis after Katz doesn't -- doesn't depend on trespass, and -- and you have said up to this point that there is no search. And then you have quite rightly said that we have had as a consideration in our minds analytically whether it's fair to say that what the police were doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest. So I'm assuming -- I'm assuming that the police can at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can certainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell. And if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting the dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to, is it fair to say that there is no compromise of the privacy interests of the people who own the house?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10146 # TRUE # MR. WRAY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Our position would be -- the answer to that question is yes. The Court does not have to resolve that issue to decide this case.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10147 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Of course, we could separate the home from the -- from what happened here and still validate the search here if we held that it was a search, but was a reasonable one since all you find is that the person was carrying contraband. It's the only thing that's disclosed. Whereas, if you -- if you did the same thing with -- with regard to a house, which is a more sacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an unreasonable search. We -- we could reach that result if we wanted to, couldn't we?

Is that okay?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10150 # TRUE # MR. WRAY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We believe it would be okay, Justice O'Connor. It would be important not to use the dogs in a way to constitute a new seizure because in that case, you're not talking --

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10153 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So you -- you give no significance to the fact that this dog sniff was in the course of a lawful stop where the citizen's rights had already been curtailed to a significant extent?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10154 # TRUE # MR. WRAY # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We believe, Justice Kennedy, that the -- that that context here makes this an even easier case under the Fourth Amendment, that is, the dog sniff not being a search compromising no legitimate privacy interests during the course of a lawful probable cause stop, which we know from Atwater -- the officer could have simply placed the woman under full custodial arrest and taken her down to jail -- was not an activity that transformed the seizure into an unlawful one. The Illinois Supreme Court's concern and where we think they got off track was that they were concerned that the use of the dog sniff during this 9-minute traffic stop was that it transformed it -- it used the language that it transformed the sniff into a drug investigation. We would submit that the Fourth Amendment is about the reasonableness of searches and seizures and not about what the scope of the government's investigation is. And in that sense, the court got off track. These -- this is a -- this is a means that law enforcement has been using properly in reliance on this Court's decision in Place, reinforced just 4 years ago in Edmond, for more than 21 years to detect everything from drugs to bombs to smuggled -- we have beagles in the airports that smuggle produce that's being smuggled in. Dogs are used all over the country with great effectiveness in law enforcement, and the -- we -- that is a -- a technique that we want to encourage law enforcement to pursue.

What were they going to do with the luggage? Were they going to open the luggage first? So, of course, the Court had to decide in that case that it wasn't that kind of a -- a search.

It depends for what purpose they want to walk those parked -- that dog around those parked cars. My assertion is --

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10221 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # The answer was they are at liberty -- the police are at liberty to use dogs to find contraband.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10222 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, I -- I strongly differ. I have to look at the purpose that they are going to use the dog for. This Court --

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10231 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I want to focus you on the question. I think what you're doing, which is a reasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to the English definition of search. I say forget that. Let's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a whole range of searches that don't even fall within the Fourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a justification. And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word English search. So I want to know why it is that this dog search is one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e., one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of what the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10232 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It invades a public -- I'm sorry.

That's the difference.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10233 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but you don't respond to one point in Place, if I remember correctly. It must be a legitimate expectation of privacy, and if the only thing the dog can detect is something illegitimate, how can you say there's an invasion of a legitimate expectation in privacy?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10234 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it is -- it's true that one does not have an expectation of privacy in contraband, but by the same token, I have an expectation or Mr. Caballes had an expectation of -- of privacy of what's inside that closed trunk, his car. The Carroll doctrine is still good law. We still apply the Fourth Amendment in cars.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10238 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # First of all, Justice Ginsburg, my recollection is that Trooper Gillette, who was the officer who stopped Caballes, did not have a -- a dog in the car.

If he had a dog in the car and the dog just happened to have alerted without his cuing the dog or walking the dog -- and I'll answer that in a moment too -- that would be pure serendipity. That might happen. If -- if the dog just happened to have alerted. But if the troopers deliberately drove the car close by -- and in reality, that's not what happens.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10241 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No. I would like to take this scenario as it is except that when the officer gets out of the car, his dog comes with him.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10244 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # My understanding of the way this works, Justice Ginsburg, is that he just couldn't go up to the car without -- and the dog would alert.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10257 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But I'm -- I'm trying to understand what you meant in your brief when you said if the dog had been in Gillette's car when Gillette stopped Caballes, the situation would have been different.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10258 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I think what I meant there -- there would have been -- it would have been purely happenstance, almost like plain view. It would have been -- without him even cuing the dog or starting to walk the dog around, my answer to that Justice Ginsburg is that that would have been all right. Except now that -- the more I think about it, I'm not so sure that it would be all right. And my answer to -- and the reason for that is I think in that case the officer, if he could do such a thing and the dog would alert, would be exploiting the situation, would just be taking the dog and walking him around the car and seeing that the dog alerted. So in other words, there -- there would be, I think, an exploitation of -- of the -- of the traffic stop.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10259 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So then it really makes no difference whether it was Gillette who had the dog in his car or whether the dispatcher called another officer who had the dog.

You, I think, were asked but I'm -- I'm not sure you fully answered. Suppose the police, as Atwater would allow, arrested, made a full arrest of Caballes, and then they impound his car. In the place where they put it, couldn't they have a dog go around the car there?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10262 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes. Yes. I -- if we had an Atwater situation -- in this case there wasn't an Atwater situation because there was first a warning given. You're correct. There was a warning given. I'm sorry.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10266 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But he didn't. He didn't. Instead, he chose to treat this as more of a Knowles situation. This case is -- is on all fours, no pun intended, like Knowles. In other words, in the -- in Knowles v. Iowa, the Court -- a case of this -- I'm sorry. Let me untwist my tongue. In Knowles v. Iowa, you had a -- you had a traffic stop and after the traffic stop, there was a statute that said unrelated to the traffic stop, you can go in and search. And this is the same thing. This officer here Gillette treated Caballes as the officer in Knowles in -- treated Mr. Knowles in Iowa. It's the exact same thing.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10267 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No, but the -- the difficulty that I have with that argument is take the -- take the case of -- of the arrestable offense in which it is undoubtedly the case that although the police don't normally arrest, they -- they can. Your -- if I understand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact, do arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and indeed, I presume you would agree, they could make an inventory search because they've got to protect themselves against claims that they lost property and so on. So there's no question that in that case, as -- as you have argued it, they could make a full-blown search and -- and certainly can use the dog. But if they choose not to arrest on the highway, they can't. My problem is how can you say that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in case number two if you admit that the police can search in case number one. How does that affect the reasonable expectation of privacy?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10268 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # To me, once a person is told that he is not going to be under arrest, it changes the whole complexion of the case.

And suppose the person who had been speeding said, yes, I mind. Don't search my car. And then the police said, well, in that case I'm going to arrest you.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10270 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's a difficult question, but I have to look at what -- I think reasonableness is judged.

And now you have to draw a pretty fine line. But it's not okay where it's not the bus station, but it is the car and in fact the dog is doing the sniffing -- and there are a lot of dogs around that can sniff -- and you did have probable cause but you didn't say it.

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10309 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But -- but is -- why -- why don't you simply say, look -- have a very simple line. If they can arrest, they can sniff. If they can't arrest, they can't sniff without individualized suspicion going to drugs or whatever.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10310 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I would agree with that if I use an -- if -- if you're referring to an Atwater type scenario. If they have probable -- if they decide to arrest, even though it's on a minor traffic case, such as Atwater, which was a seat belt, as long as it's -- if -- if it's minor and if the officer elects to choose to do a full-blown arrest, then all the consequences that follow from that arrest are -- it's going to happen. Excuse me. It's going to happen.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10311 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But what -- what is the answer to the reasonable expectation to privacy question in that case? Isn't your expectation of privacy identical, whatever it may be, or isn't the reasonable expectation of privacy identical, whatever that may be, without regard to the discretionary decision of the officer to arrest or not?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10312 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I think that when the officer does a full-blown arrest, as was envisioned in Atwater, you know that you -- the person knows that he or she does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10313 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But you're saying that the -- the reasonable expectation of privacy depends upon the officer's discretionary judgment whether or not to arrest. Isn't that what you're saying?
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10314 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Essentially yes, because I think that the officer takes a physical action. It's just more than words. It's also his deeds. I think in Atwater, unlike Knowles -- in Atwater, in that case, I think the -- the officer did make an election, and there was a full-blown or a full-fledged arrest. And I think there your -- your reasonable expectation to privacy does, in fact, go out the window. But this is so different. This was just a warning. Period. It was nothing worse than a warning. What makes this stop so pernicious is that it takes place in front of the whole world and is accusatory. It is profoundly embarrassing, and it is humiliating to everyone on the street. So if a person is stopped and the officer just decides to stop you for a minor traffic offense, that's the worst part about this case. Just a minor traffic offense, really a frivolous offense, basically what any law-abiding citizen would happen to -- it could happen to anyone. And as this Court has said, even in Whren, there are so many multiple technical violations of -- of -- technical violations --
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10315 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I mean, I think it's worse if -- if you're subjected to it without having committed any violation at all. Every time I travel abroad and come back into the country, customs officers have dogs and -- and they parade the dogs through -- through the baggage terminal. Do -- do I feel offended by that?

argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10318 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That -- in that situation, when you enter the country -- and this Court has said many times again -- it's a border search. There's nothing that I can argue against the border search. It's the -- or the functional equivalent of the border. That is a border search. I bring luggage to the airport, in today's world I have a lesser expectation of privacy. If I know I'm traveling abroad and coming into the United States, that's different. That's different in an airport.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10319 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. A bus station is different, though.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10320 # TRUE # MR. MECZYK # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # A bus station here inside the United States is different I think. I -- I look at your airport hypothetical as being -- as dealing with a border. If it's not at a border and I use your hypothetical, it's at O'Hare Airport or Reagan International Airport and they bring a dog up to sniff for drugs at the carousel, that to me is a search. It's like -- I think you said in one opinion once if it -- you used the duck analogy, well, if it walks like a duck or quacks like a duck. Here it's still a search. It walks like a -- a dog and it acts like a dog, but its specific function is in fact to search out in public and humiliate people. If there are any further questions. I respectfully ask this honorable Court to affirm the wise judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court. Thank you.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10321 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Meczyk. General Madigan, you have I think about 3 minutes left.
argument in Illinois against Caballes # 03-923 # 10323 # FALSE # MS. MADIGAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Justice Stevens. Let me make three brief points. Number one, Justice Ginsburg asked a question about something that was in the respondent's brief, whether or not it made a difference if a dog was with Master Sergeant Gillette when he initiated the stop or if the dog was later brought, as was the case here, by Trooper Graham. Really what Mr. Caballes is arguing for here is an inadvertence requirement which this Court very clearly held in Horton, there is no such requirement of inadvertence. And so a law officer, if they are at a lawful vantage point, do have the ability to detect incriminating facts. That is not something that has to occur inadvertently. It can happen intentionally. Second, Justice Scalia asked a question about plain view, and similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not effect an incremental search or seizure. And therefore, similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not require Fourth Amendment justification. And let me finally acknowledge something that Justice Souter brought up, which is whether or not, by walking a dog around a house, you in fact would have a search. Let me -- now, that is certainly a closer case than whether walking a dog around a car constitutes a search, which we say is not. But ultimately you would reach a similar result because the principle is not going to extend to cars in the same manner in -- in Kyllo as the thermal imager did. Finally, if there are no further questions, we would ask that the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court be reversed.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10331 # FALSE # MR. LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: When experienced counsel thoroughly investigates, prepares for trial, and discusses his trial strategy with his client, a challenge for effectiveness may not presume prejudice. Rather, this Court's two-part inquiry, articulated in Strickland v. Washington, is the proper measure. The Florida Supreme Court erred in its decision below for three main reasons. First, they failed to apply Strickland's two part circumstance-specific, performance prejudice inquiry to a question of trial strategy. Second, it improperly presumed prejudice under this Court's decision in United States v. Cronic where there was neither a complete denial of counsel, nor did counsel entirely fail to subject the State's case to meaningful adversarial testing. Third, the Florida Supreme Court improperly expanded this Court's decision in Boykin v. Alabama from governing pleas of guilt to governing tactical decisions made during full-fledged trials. For these three reasons and because the Florida court's decision conflicts with Strickland and its progeny and will disrupt the effective administration of justice, we request reversal.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10333 # TRUE # MR. LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Justice O'Connor, it was not. Mr. Corin, after speaking to his client on three occasions about this trial strategy, sought to concede the underlying -- the underlying crimes but to argue what was the most essential part of this case, and that was whether or not death should be the outcome of the jury.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10334 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, yes, he clearly tried to preserve a role in the sentencing, but we often have guilty pleas and then leave the sentencing to be determined.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10335 # TRUE # MR. LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It was not, Your Honor, because a guilty plea, as this Court talked about in Boykin v. Alabama, gives up rights of the defendant. The lawyer and the defendant waive rights. They waive the right to trial. They waive the right to have the State prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. They waive the right to have a jury, to confront witnesses, to cross examine, all of the attendant trial rights. Mr. Nixon -- JUSTICE

There was cross examination of one of Mr. Nixon's uncles, who was one of the seven confessions in this case, and we don't know specifically why Mr. Corin engaged in that cross examination. It could be because that was probably the weakest of the seven confessions and perhaps he wanted the jury to hear that that confession was weak.

Three trial court judges all found that there was effective assistance of counsel. Judge Hall, who presided over the trial, in fact, described Mr. Corin's advocacy as being right on the mark. He found in his approach an excellent analysis of the realities of the case and the preservation of credibility and the credibility of any mitigating circumstances. He also found that it was perhaps the only steps that could have been taken to afford his client some relief.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10373 # TRUE # MR. LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, I think that Brookhart in fact probably supports our position because in Brookhart the situation was factually different. It was more of a -- a guilty plea situation where there was going to be this prima facie trial, which was, in essence, a guilty plea with a profferer through one witness. And in that case, the defendant stood up and said, I want a trial, I want everyone to understand I'm not pleading guilty. And this Court said that counsel can't waive those rights to a full trial when the defendant is objecting to it, but if the defendant consents or acquiesces, this Court said the ruling would be different. Well, certainly Mr. Nixon at least acquiesced. Mr. Corin spoke to him on three occasions -- and that can be found at 255 of the joint appendix -- and talked to him about this strategy. Mr. Nixon never responded either way as to his assent or what he wanted to be done. Now, Judge Ferris, who was the third trial court judge who heard this matter, said that because of the longstanding relationship between this defendant and this lawyer, because he had represented him three times before over a 2-year period, that there was a level of relationship, they were both veterans of the criminal justice system, they had a rapport with each other. And she was able to determine that there was consent to the trial strategy in the fact that Mr. Nixon did not object to it. The Florida Supreme Court wants explicit and affirmative consent, and they want a colloquy on the record. And we think that this will be very problematic, and we're already seeing these problems in Florida.

LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, I think you do and I think that Boykin addresses that there has to be a colloquy with a plea of guilty, and that the -- the defendant can't tacitly consent to a plea of guilty. But our position is that this is not a plea of guilty. This is not a complete surrender. This is a tactical retreat made for reasons of trying to contest the one issue in this case that could be contested, and that was trying to save this defendant's life.

He was obviously not -- didn't want to be responsive.

LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, Florida does have a rule for a guilty plea, but -- and now the Florida Supreme Court says there has to be a colloquy for a strategy decision that -- where there's a concession, but we disagree with that. We don't think that there should be a colloquy. We don't think that that -- that should be required. And we think that that's problematic and we're already seeing in Florida that -- that judges, laboring under the Nixon decision, are asking questions to defendants as to whether or not all sorts of strategy decisions are decisions they agreed to.

LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well -- well, Justice Ginsburg, they're doing it under these decisions of this Court is the reason why that they've articulated that this has to be done. They're saying it's a functional equivalent of a guilty plea. Therefore, Boykin is required and therefore there has to be a colloquy. And we think that those colloquies are tremendously problematic, that they invade the attorney-client privilege. They may affect an accused's right to -- you know, not to self-incriminate himself. There may violate the relationship between the lawyer and his client.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10420 # FALSE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The most serious problem with the Florida Supreme Court's explicit consent requirement is that it prevents counsel from pursuing what may be the most effective strategy for saving a defendant's life, even when counsel consults with the defendant on that strategy and the defendant does not object. In that situation, the Florida Supreme Court would require counsel to pursue an alternative reasonable doubt strategy even though that might undermine the case for sparing the defendant's life and even though the defendant has not consented to that strategy either.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10421 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Do we take it as a given that if he does not consent, in fact, directs his lawyer not to make this concession, that the lawyer is bound to follow?
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10422 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Justice Kennedy. You would still look at that question through the prism of Strickland's reasonableness inquiry. It would raise distinct concerns. A reasonable counsel would make a reasonable effort to iron out differences. Reasonable counsel takes into account the considered views of his client. But if, at the end of that process, counsel reasonably concludes that this is the only effective strategy for saving the defendant's life, then the pursuit of that strategy is not per se ineffective.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10426 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # As -- the defendant could go to the -- to the judge and his counsel could go to the judge and say, we have had such a breakdown between us on what should be done here, we think alternative counsel should be appointed. But that would be a discretionary call for the district court. So too, the defendant could say, I want to exercise my right to self-representation, which he has a right to do. So those are the two checks on that.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10427 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But what -- what if there's a third possibility and -- and the lawyer makes remarks in front of the jury, as -- as this lawyer did, in effect, concession kind of remarks, and the defendant stands up and says, hey, I'm not making those concessions? I am not guilty. I'm not conceding a darned thing. Does the lawyer at that point at least have a -- an option to proceed on the concession theory, leaving it to judge his performance under Strickland afterwards?
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10428 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If I understand your question, Justice Souter, this is a situation where there was no objection initially, the lawyer proceeded to adopt a strategy, and then there was a --
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10429 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I -- actually I -- I didn't get into that one way or the other. Let's assume we've got a case in which the client says, no, I -- I don't agree to these concessions. I'm not guilty and I want a defense. As I understood your -- your earlier answer, you said if -- you know, if it is the lawyer's considered judgment that this is the only way to save his life -- he's talked with him, et cetera -- he -- he still may have that option to concede. And I'm taking the -- the facts one step further and saying let's assume the -- the client goes whole-hog in his objection. And he stands up or -- or says in front of the judge and the jury, I -- I'm not conceding any of this.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10431 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I -- I would certainly agree if we get to that point. But let's the lawyer does, as you at least left the door open for him to do, and -- and he does proceed to represent the guy. The judge doesn't remove him and the lawyer continues to concede. Do you -- do you think that there is any possibility on a Strickland analysis of finding adequacy of counsel?
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10432 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Probably not, Justice Souter, that you would analyze that under Strickland and you would find that that's not the reasonable performance of counsel in that circumstance.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10434 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And so -- but the question here really is what do you do not in a case where there's been an objection, because there was no objection here.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10435 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So a substantial component of reasonableness under Strickland is whether or not you follow the client's instructions?
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10436 # TRUE # MR. GORNSTEIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # It is one factor that reasonable counsel will take into account, but it is not the only factor. In some situations, if you're not following the defendant's instructions, it can lead to such a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship that you couldn't possibly render effective assistance of counsel. So it is going to be a factor in that respect. But this case presents only the question of what happens when there's no objection, and when there's no objection, it makes no sense to say that where there's been consultation, no objection, that instead of allowing the lawyer to exercise his reasonable judgment on what the best thing to do is, he instead has to pursue an alternative reasonable doubt strategy that is less effective. And the Sixth Amendment simply can't be read to require counsel to pursue a less effective strategy that the defendant hasn't asked for. Now, there's no perfect analogy here, but the closest analogy is to the division of responsibilities for appeal where the defendant has the right to say whether he will appeal, but counsel has the right primarily to make the strategic judgments of what arguments will be raised on appeal. So too here, the -- the defendant has the right to decide to stand trial, but client has primary responsibility for making the strategic judgment of what defenses will be raised at that trial. Now, there is -- this is an important question, and therefore there is a duty on the part of counsel to consult with the defendant, but once that consultation has occurred, and there is no objection, and the choice that counsel made is a reasonable, tactical judgment under all the facts and circumstances, his pursuit of that strategy satisfies constitutional standards. There is no requirement of explicit, affirmative consent, and the Florida Supreme Court's judgment should, therefore, be reversed. If the Court has no further questions, thank you.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10439 # FALSE # MR. TILLINGHAST # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The issue before the Court today is whether a defense counsel can concede guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in his opening and in his closing statements in the trial, particularly when the defendant is not present. We submit that the answer is no, and there's two reasons that it's no. First, we believe that it's the functional equivalent of a guilty plea as found by the Florida Supreme Court. Second, because the -- what was stated was so clearly an acknowledgement that the State had proven its case, that there was a complete breakdown of the adversarial process and there was no meaningful testing of the State's case.

Because I don't want to lose sight of it. You seem to suggest that the defendant's absence from the trial should work in his favor when this was defendant's own choice not to be there. The judge met with him and said I want to make sure you know what you're doing. Right? Why should we count at all in the defendant's favor that he was -- he absented himself from trial any more than we would give a fugitive credit for not being there?
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10441 # TRUE # MR. TILLINGHAST # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, part of the issue here is -- is the lack of consent. Mr. Nixon was not present during the entire guilt phase of the trial. What we would submit is that in this case where there was the hearing in a holding cell -- it was on the record. It's part of the record before Your Honor -- where the judge inquired about Mr. Nixon's willingness to participate in his trial, and he declined to go into the courtroom, that refusal to go into the courtroom, we submit, was a refusal to attend the -- the hearing on the presumption that he was going to have a trial consistent with his guilty plea -- or not guilty plea -- excuse me -- the not guilty plea that was entered. What he anticipated was a trial where the State's case was -- was tested and it was consistent with his not guilty plea.

Well, in this case, he was absent because he chose to be absent. You're -- you're equating this case to one in which it was as if for some reason they forgot to have him in the courtroom.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10444 # TRUE # MR. TILLINGHAST # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the -- the important issue here is there was not consent. The lack of his presence in the courtroom compounded that problem, but the important issue here and the issue before the Court is that defense counsel conceded guilt and conceded that the State had proven its case without the consent of his own client.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10445 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I don't agree with your earlier statement that what -- what this defendant expected was a contested trial in which, you know, the State's evidence is challenged, blah, blah, blah.

He wasn't -- he wasn't expecting -- in fact, if you're -- if you're talking about is subjective expectations, they would reinforce the lawyer's belief that he had no objection to conceding guilt because he was referring to this as -- as one big railroad job.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10446 # TRUE # MR. TILLINGHAST # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, respectfully, Your Honor, I would -- I would disagree because that what -- what we do have from Mr. Nixon is he stated that -- that he had fired his lawyer. He wanted a black lawyer. He wanted a black judge, and that he didn't want to go into the courtroom because he would be railroaded.

When a client doesn't say yes and he doesn't say no, to take the words of a familiar song, mustn't the lawyer then do what he thinks is best to do? Because if he says, okay, I'm going to -- I'm going to require a full-stop trial, I'm going to cross examine every witness, he may be damaging his client.

The language, functional equivalent of a guilty plea, is lifted from Brookhart. Boykin and Brookhart are about what a judge does, not about what a lawyer does. In Boykin, the judge accepted the guilty plea, and the Court said you can't do it without the express consent of the defendant. In Brookhart, it was a judge who accepted -- now, here it was an odd procedure, and it was that procedure that the Court called the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. And therefore, we're talking about what a judge can do. Here we're not. We're talking about what a lawyer can do and when it arises to the level of improper lack of counsel. So I don't think they govern it. Rather, I thought -- and I want your view on this -- that the most relevant case was really Roe v. Flores, you know, where -- where the lawyer did a weird thing. He didn't file an appeal. And here he's doing a little odd thing. So what we said there is you have to consult, which is just what the Government is saying here. I'm exposing that thought process to you to get your reaction.

Barnes, it's been held by this Court that there are three fundamental things that only the client can do, one of which is to plead guilty. And in -- in the Roe case, the -- the record below was -- was unclear as to what happened as to whether there was a duty for the attorney to file an appeal and what the conversations were or were not with -- with the defendant. But we would submit that -- that a guilty plea is something very special because that it goes to the heart of the case.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10490 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # This is not a guilty plea and the words -- a guilty plea is something accepted by a judge and the judge didn't. But I grant you it's a very odd situation and very special, and that's why I wonder what the appropriate way to -- what kind of requirement there ought to be. Maybe there should be something. I'm not sure why it should rise above the level of consultation since you know, better than I, you can have some awfully difficult clients who are virtually incapable of understanding what's in their interests. And -- and that's why I'm awfully reluctant to go beyond saying you have to consult with your client. You start insisting on an answer, and you don't know what they're going to say.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10491 # TRUE # MR. TILLINGHAST # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the -- the lawyer here did have alternatives. He -- he could have put the State to its burden and consistent with the not guilty plea that was entered in the case. Or as an alternative, there could have been an inquiry on the record of -- by the judge with the lawyers of Mr. Nixon to determine whether or not he was consenting to this -- this sort of -- the opening statements and the closing statements, which -- which were extraordinary, particularly the closing statement because -- and in the closing statement, he specifically said that the State did prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each and every element of the crimes charged, first degree, premeditated murder, kidnapping, robbery, and arson, had been proven, which is truly extraordinary. Here is a situation where the lawyer who is the only person in the courtroom, because Mr. Nixon was tried in absentia, who -- the only person in the courtroom who was there as the trusted advisor and counselor for Mr. Nixon, stands up in front of the jury in the opening and the closing and concedes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I would submit that upon doing that, the -- the whole adversarial process breaks down because it --

In this case, in fact the client didn't say yes and he didn't say no. So if the -- if the lawyer is to assume, well, then since I don't have a positive, explicit yes, I will assume the answer is no, even though that is against the lawyer's best interest -- the -- the lawyer's best judgment, why is he an effective counsel if he assumes the answer is no?

Nobody is saying that the client should not make a decision. The problem is that the client won't make a decision, and the client acts as if he had made the decision to allow the lawyer to do what the lawyer proposes. This isn't a question of whether he should be heard or not, but what -- what to make of the behavior. And you're saying when -- when the behavior appears to be acquiescence from silence, you nonetheless -- the lawyer is, nonetheless, obligated to take the course which is coming closest to guaranteeing that he will receive the death penalty. And that's what's bothering us.

And in -- in the record below where the Florida Supreme Court sent it down to determine whether or not there was consent, there was no acquiescence. Mr. Nixon simply did nothing. When -- when asked -- when Mr. Corin testified and was asked about whether he discussed the trial strategy and whether Mr. Nixon agreed or disagreed, Mr. Nixon simply did nothing.

argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10533 # TRUE # MR. TILLINGHAST # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # So, in conclusion, Your Honors, we submit that there are two -- two approaches to affirming the Florida Supreme Court. First is -- is that it was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent. The second is that because of the nature of the statements, it was a complete failure of the advocacy process where the State's case was not tested in any way. In fact, as I mentioned, there were 35 witnesses. There were five very perfunctory questions asked such as what date was it and when did certain things occur. There was not the material testing of the record to determine the truth, which is what is -- is involved in the Sixth Amendment. And none of -- none of the challenges, that are pointed out in -- to the facts in our brief ever came out because that there was no testing. Simply we have an opening statement where counsel says the State will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these events occurred. Then we have virtually no cross examination. We have no witnesses called by the State -- excuse me -- by -- by the defendant throughout the entire guilt phase of the trial. And in fact, at one point, the -- the trial judge stopped asking -- asking Mr. Corin if he wished to cross examine. And then we have the closing statement where Mr. Corin stated that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that -- that he is -- Mr. Nixon was guilty of the crimes. And all the while during that guilt phase, Mr. Nixon was not present in the courtroom. So he had no ability to object to the opening or the closing statements because he wasn't here -- there to hear them. And further, as -- as the record indicates, there are issues of -- of Mr. Nixon's competency, that he's mentally retarded. His own lawyer referred to him as nuts. His own lawyer also referred to him as an ogre in his closing argument. These are the types of statements, we would submit, are -- even if they are not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea without consent, they -- they substantially and completely destroy the advocacy process. So there is no testing, and under Cronic, the Court should affirm also. Thank you.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10534 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Thank you, Mr. Tillinghast. Mr. Lemieux, you have about 4 minutes left.
argument in Florida against Nixon # 03-931 # 10536 # FALSE # MR. LEMIEUX # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you, Justice Stevens. I'd like to point this Court to page 486 of the joint appendix where Mr. Corin is asked, do you feel in this case that you were put in a position that you had to make decisions because your client did nothing? And he said, yes, sir. There is ample evidence in the post trial proceedings that Mr. Corin wanted the help of his client. He did not want to be on the bridge of the ship alone, but Mr. Nixon abandoned the ship. And although he consulted with his client at least three times on this trial strategy, there was no input back that would have given him any reason to believe that Mr. Nixon did not want him to go forward to pursue a strategy that Mr. Corin, in his experience of 14 years as a lawyer, after having taken 52 depositions in this case, believed was in the best interest of his client. I just have a couple of points I'd like to make. There was a question that was asked about whether or not the -- the guilt phase and the penalty phase are distinct parts of a trial. This Court has addressed that in the Monj v. California case when it said that it's really one trial and that issues of guilt and innocence are often, in a capital trial, still being determined in the penalty phase of that matter. I'd also like to mention the point that the counsel made about Cronic. Counsel would ask, as the Florida Supreme Court did, to apply Cronic to this situation. There is a harmony that exists in this jurisprudence between Strickland and Cronic. Issues of trial performance and trial strategy are articulated and evaluated under Strickland's two-part standard. Questions of structural defects that infect the process with error are evaluated under Cronic. And that harmony works in the system. It allows for the independence and vitality of counsel to pursue strategies in their clients' best interests and it also allows when there are structural defects, for them to be taken care of with the presumption.

The defense has the burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel. During the first hearing, there was an issue as to whether or not it was an ineffective counsel hearing because it was still on direct appeal. But certainly in hearings two and three, there was ample opportunity to put that evidence on the record, and they didn't take that opportunity. Now, they quibbled and said they didn't have notice and they didn't know that they were supposed to be here for a Strickland hearing. We disagree with that because there aren't Strickland hearings, there are not Cronic hearings.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10553 # FALSE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents two disparate views of what kind of loss is necessary to sustain a claim for securities fraud under the Reform Act's loss causation requirement. The minority view of artificial inflation articulated by the Ninth Circuit is illogical and equates loss with purchase, regardless of whether the investor has suffered any economic harm. An investor does not suffer any harm until some form of corrective disclosure occurs and the artificial inflation is removed from the stock. The two events must be related. There is no causal connection between the harm and the misrepresentation otherwise. The majority rule correctly requires a causal connection between the misrepresentation and a decline in value. The -- and the statute itself is expressed in terms of causation that a plaintiff prove that the act of the defendant caused the loss. When we look at the statute of the Reform Act and other provisions, we see supporting language. In section 21D of the Reform Act, we see under the provision that has been known as the look-back provision that the Congress discussed the loss in terms of trading price after a corrective disclosure. Similarly in section 105 of the Reform Act, although dealing with section 12 of the Securities Act, the Reform Act, in its one place where it actually spoke of loss causation and its definition, defined it in terms of depreciation in value. And the -- the depreciation in value of the security would be attributable to the fraud.

In addition, throughout the pleadings of this case -- we're now on the third complaint -- the -- the plaintiffs have not raised that issue and have not sought to plead causation consistent with the -- our view of the world.

And the issue would have not only related to the -- the damages instructions but would have related to the misrepresentation instruction. And the -- the problem that -- that we continue to have with the -- the case after the Ninth Circuit's opinion is where do you look for the misrepresentation and where do you look for the damage and how do you know that there is a loss under the statute.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10573 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And -- and what we would be looking for is evidence that -- that such a actual loss occurred in response to a corrective disclosure in the marketplace.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10574 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, doesn't it depend on -- on what you -- what you consider to be the value of the stock. Until the disclosure of the fact that they didn't find gold is made, the stock is still worth $60, isn't it?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10575 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, it is.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10576 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Because everybody else thinks they found gold too. So you're still holding stock worth $60, if worth means its market value. Right?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10577 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That is correct.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10578 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And we're dealing with a special rule that looks to market value. Right? You don't have to have the -- the representation made explicitly to the plaintiff. It's a representation that was made to the market at large which caused the market value of the stock. Right?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10579 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That is correct.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10580 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So he paid $60, he got $60. There's no loss.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10581 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And would have the ability to continue to sell that stock for $60 in the marketplace until such time as there was a corrective disclosure.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10582 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is there any other problem? I'm trying to get a list of what the problems are with the simple theory. Now, I've heard one that you've ratified. (Laughter.)
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10583 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And -- and is there any other?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10584 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Thank you. The -- the other is -- is I think an issue of certainty as to the marketplace. Remember, we are operating on a fraud-on-the-market theory context here in this kind of action, and in that -- in that context, when there is a disclosure in the marketplace, you have certainty as to what the market actually valued the decline to be as opposed to speculation that there was in fact inflation at the -- at the time of purchase. The Ninth Circuit's purchase time rule in the -- in the fraud-on-the-market context doesn't necessarily identify the decline in the value of the stock which you can get from the marketplace, and that I think is just better -- a better indicator.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10585 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Now, can we -- can they prove this? $60. $50 is wrong, is inflated because of the gold. It turns out that gold never existed and they knew it. The stock is not selling for $60 anymore. It's selling for $200. They found platinum. No one expected it. All right. They want to prove maybe it is selling for $200, but if we had found gold as well, it would have sold for $250. Can they do it?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10586 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The Congress has told us that we should look for loss, and that --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10587 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It's a loss. $250 versus $200.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10588 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- and that leads us to the -- the point that -- that whether the increase can actually be pled. But if there is a disclosure that indicates that the gold component was not part of the -- of the -- the discoveries, and the plaintiffs can indicate that there was an upward tick because of the platinum and a downward movement in the stock because of the disclosure about gold, then I think those two can be separated and pled accordingly.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10589 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And both would be all right because what's the difference between not getting as much appreciation as you would have gotten if the correct information had been out there and getting less than you would have gotten. I mean, in both cases the shareholder is affected the same way. They didn't get as much in one case. So you're not distinguishing between those. I think you're agreeing that in both cases the -- the discovery of platinum is the shares go up, but they would have gone up much higher if there had been gold as well. That shareholder has a claim under your theory, doesn't she?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10590 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, that shareholder -- it would depend on what has happened in the marketplace. If there has not been a disclosure about the absence of gold, that stock would still reflect the -- the value of the expectation of gold.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10591 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Yes, but I'm assuming that -- that there is, and so the stock goes up but not as much as it would have. But on the point of disclosure, there is a difference between your position and the Government's, and I really would like you to tell me if that's genuine or it's my misperception. Your view is there's the disclosure of the bad news, the lie, and the price drops. In the Government's presentation -- and I'm reading from page 19 -- the fraud can be revealed by means other than a corrective disclosure and a drop in the stock price may not be a necessary condition for establishing loss causation in every fraud on the marketplace.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10592 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Our position is we believe that a drop in the price is necessary to demonstrate the loss.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10593 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But the Government --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10594 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They do.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10595 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It doesn't matter in this case, does it? Is -- is that issue before us?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10596 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In this case --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10597 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Do we have to decide that issue here?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10598 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We don't have to decide that issue for this case.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10599 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # And is it -- is it easy to prove that -- that the price of this now valuable stock because they found platinum would have been $40 higher had they found gold? I mean, the burden would be on the plaintiff to prove that -- would -- I mean, if we adopted that theory.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10600 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The plaintiff has that burden --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10601 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It would be very hard to prove, it seems to me.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10602 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And -- and at the pleading stage, I believe that they could be segregated and -- and an upward movement in the stock could be distinguished from a downward movement in the stock. But the downward movement in stock would be the focus from our standpoint.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10603 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # In -- in your view, is the plaintiff entitled to an expectancy measure of damage, or is it more the traditional tort measure which is out-of- pocket losses?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10604 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We don't believe that they are entitled to any expectation damages. It would be an out-of-pocket loss calculation.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10605 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is the -- is the respondents' position properly characterized as asking for expectancy damages or is that too simplistic a view?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10606 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I think that it is perhaps inclusive of expectancy. It really depends on how you view that price inflation theory.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10607 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # I think they'd be called reliance damages. You know, I used to teach contract law. We would call it reliance damages.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10608 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And it gets back in our view to the transaction causation distinction in the securities cases that talk about the reliance transaction, price inflation that occurs at the front end.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10609 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If that's so then -- then on the platinum/gold theory, you can't really recover what would have happened if there had been gold because it might be that the stock would have been worth $400 if there had been gold even though 15 years earlier when he only paid $50 for it, he's only out of pocket, at most, $50. But if there had been gold, because of the gold market in the world, it would have been a lot more valuable. And you're saying he can't do that? I don't know. Maybe that question isn't in the case, but that strikes me as a difficult question.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10610 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Following your -- your suggestion about the price of gold, it would depend on where that -- that disclosure occurred in connection with the price of -- the price of gold, if that disclosure occurred, and if there was an economic loss that could be -- could be tied to it. The passage of time here is important only insofar as it allows for the corrective disclosure and a chance for the market to reflect an economic loss.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10611 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Sullivan, you refer to the disclosure as being the key point and when you measure the -- the loss and so forth. What if the information leaks out and there's no specific one disclosure that does it all and the stock gradually declines over a period of six months?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10612 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10613 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # How would you handle that case?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10614 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that a plaintiff would be able to handle that in -- in a pleading and they would have to identify the leaks and if there are several, identify each of them and identify them as --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10615 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, maybe they don't know the leaks. The only thing they can prove is that there was a gross false statement at the time they bought the stock and they don't know what happened to the decline. Later on they find out that it gradually leaked out. Do they have to prove exactly how the information became public?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10616 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The key is that they have to prove that the loss was connected to the misrepresentation and that the drop in --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10617 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, they -- they wouldn't have to prove how it came out. They would just have to prove that the market knew the truth, no matter how the market learned the truth. I mean, if it was published in a -- in a column by some market reporter who doesn't disclose how he found out. So long as the market knows the truth, isn't that all they need?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10618 # TRUE # MR. SULLIVAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # So I was distinguishing -- yes is the answer to your question. I was distinguishing a situation where the price just trickled down and no one knew until later. And the -- the question that Justice Scalia poses about the -- the leak coming out over time but it is the -- the fact that the market becomes aware of the reason for the misrepresentation, it is in fact appropriate. The -- the other point that I would like to make, in addition to the statutory scheme, is -- is this Court's decision in Basic v. Levinson creates a tension here, and I -- and I think a conflict that is very important to -- to discern. The -- Basic v. Levinson presents the fraud-on-the-market theory, and from that fraud-on-the-market theory we have a rebuttable presumption of reliance for transaction causation. The Ninth Circuit's view collapses the -- the Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit's view of transaction causation with loss causation and presents a conflict as it relates to that presumption. The presumption, which is based on a well- developed, efficient capital market that gets the information out quickly and is easily digestible -- that -- that presumption is at odds with the Reform Act's requirement that there be a burden of proof. If you collapse the transaction causation and the loss causation, you've got a head-on collision between the rebuttable presumption of reliance and the Congress' codification of the Loss Causation Act and the Reform Act. And we think, at the end of the day, the Ninth Circuit's decision really renders that conflict apparent and makes the act of Congress in the Reform Act one that was meaningless. The -- I think the legislative history is also supportive of our position so far as particularly the Senate report is very important in the -- in the phrase where it talks about the obligation of the plaintiff to prove that the loss in the value of the stock was caused by the section 10(b) violation and not by other factors. That is a critical component here of the analysis and I think very helpful from the standpoint of the legislative history in identifying what we have. Finally, I -- the last point I'd like to make is that the Reform Act from Congress was designed to and sought to establish uniform and fairly stringent pleading guidelines, and this was to address congressional concerns over frivolous suits. And Congress, in enacting the Reform Act, was not signaling any intention to relax the requirements of section 10(b), was -- rather, was enacting a very specific loss causation requirement. And historically there was a very clear and distinct body of law at the time, the Huddleston case, the Bastian case, and that was codified. And there was a very clear perception that Congress was acting and not collapsing the loss causation transaction rule into the loss -- the transaction causation into the loss causation, which I think creates this conflict. If there are no further questions, Justice Stevens, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10629 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I'm not sure that I can accurately tell you petitioners' position, but I can tell you our position, which is that in a fraud-on-the-market case the plaintiff cannot -- has failed to plead loss causation unless the plaintiff pleads that the -- the inflation attributable to the misrepresentation or omission has been removed or reduced from the price of the stock through dissemination of corrective information of some sort to the market. That does not mean that the company must make an announcement or that there must be an admission of fraud or that there must be really any information, any -- any sort of formal disclosure. But if the information is disseminated to the market such that the market, in whole or in part, becomes aware of the truth and adjusts the price accordingly, that price adjustment is loss and the plaintiff has alleged loss causation in an amount to be proven at trial.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10630 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, doesn't the general rule 8 governing complaints -- isn't that adequate? You have to plead under that every element of an affirmative case.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10633 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the -- I don't think the question -- we cited rule 9(b) in our brief because fraud must be pled with particularity and -- and that -- and that rule applies to all the, quote, circumstances constituting a fraud. But the Court doesn't need to address the question because even under rule 8, the plaintiff must allege all the elements of the cause of action.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10634 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # We don't have to get into that.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10635 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's correct. That's absolutely right.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10636 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But, Mr. Hungar, if you look at the forms of what's proper pleading under the Federal rules on causation, the sample pleadings say, for example, for money lent, the defendant owes the plaintiff for money lent. Period. Or for goods sold and delivered. Nothing more. Just alleged causation. Defendant -- plaintiff alleges I lost X amount and it was caused by defendant. I thought you pointed to the 9(b) rule because fraud must be pleaded with particularity, but causation does not, not under the rules and not under the statute.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10637 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, as we said in our brief, we think 9(b) applies here. Obviously, this is a fraud case.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10638 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But that -- that's to the -- to the allegation of fraud, but not causation.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10639 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Congress has made very clear that loss causation is an element of the cause of action. The elements must be pled. In a fraud case, they must be pled with particularity, but even -- even in a -- in a common law --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10640 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It says -- but the fraud must be pleaded with particularity, not all the elements of a fraud claim.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10641 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, with respect, Your Honor, we think circumstances -- it does not constitute fraud if there is no loss causation. At least it certainly doesn't constitute securities fraud under this statute, and if the complaint does not plead loss causation, it hasn't pled fraud. So we submit that --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10642 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # That's not correct I don't think. I think there could be a completely fraudulent statement but no -- no damages as a result of it. There would still be fraud.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10643 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, but in a -- in a private action for securities fraud, loss causation is an element of the cause of action. It's not an element in every fraud case.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10644 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # It's not an element of the fraud. It's an element of the cause -- cause of action.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10647 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # But there -- I mean, there are cases in the -- in the courts of appeals saying that -- that rule 9(b) applies to all the elements, and we're not aware of cases -- the -- the -- one of the amicus briefs cites cases which focus on the nature of the representation, and that's certainly where 9(b) issues are generally fought out because in a -- in a typical securities case, loss causation is not a difficult issue because the -- the bad news is -- is announced, the stock drops, and the plaintiff pleads loss causation as a matter of course. It -- it's -- it's not a difficult burden to satisfy in your run-of-the-mill securities case.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10650 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, as a -- as a practical matter, Your Honor, there's a huge difference in how these cases are litigated because it's the difference between spending millions of dollars on discovery, literally millions of dollars on discovery, or not. If -- if the plaintiff has failed to allege loss causation and for some reason feels unable to allege it, the -- the case is going to be dismissed. If the court doesn't require loss causation, as the Ninth Circuit did -- did here, that means the case is going to go to discovery and the defendant is going to have to either spend millions of dollars on their own lawyers or spend millions of dollars to settle even in a case that -- where the plaintiff might be unable to establish loss causation. That's why --

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10653 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Is the reason -- is there a further reason that they've got to -- to plead loss causation? And that is, by reading (e)(2), in effect, as -- as making -- as -- as saying that if you were going to recover on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you in effect have -- have got to prove your loss in a certain way. And you're saying if you're going to -- if you're going to sue on a fraud-on-the-market theory, you've got to allege all the elements of fraud on the market. And if you allege all the elements of fraud on the market, you're going to allege exactly what you've just been saying is required. So it's not so the -- I -- I guess what I'm -- I'm getting at is maybe what -- maybe the nub of the answer is not necessarily that there's -- that there's fraud involved, but there is a fraud-on-the-market theory as the basis for the cause of action, and if that is the basis, it's got to be disclosed in the pleadings as an element.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10654 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that's -- that's a helpful way to look at it, Justice Souter, because it's -- in -- in a fraud-on-the-market case, by definition the plaintiff is alleging that there was an efficient national market and that is what makes the difference. If this were the -- you -- you buy a gold mine, like the -- the old common law cases that respondents cite, there's no efficient national market on which the -- the plaintiff can turn around and sell it at the same price until the information has been disclosed. But when it is an -- a national, active stock market, the market continues to reflect the inflation, and so -- so the plaintiff has not been injured, and the allegation that it was an efficient market and I bought it at an inflated price does not support an inference of -- of injury. And the -- and so because it is a fraud-on-the-market case, that's exactly right. The additional information must be pled in the complaint or else no injury has been -- been pled and the complaint must be dismissed.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10661 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # If -- if it's not confined to fraud-on-the-market, then there's the argument on the other side that all -- all (2) is really doing is saying that if you are going to establish your damages by reference to market price, this is the way you've got to do it. You've got to go through this mean price analysis and so on. But they are saying we are not simply trying to establish our damages by reference to the market, and therefore we're not bound by -- and therefore, (e)(2), in effect, is -- is irrelevant. What -- what is your answer?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10662 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think they -- they unquestionably are trying to establish their damages.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10667 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, what they paid happens to be the market price, but -- but you can't really say that the Ninth Circuit was referring to the market price as part of its -- its damages. Its damages are what they paid. Whether that -- if they paid above market, it would be the same.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10668 # TRUE # MR. HUNGAR # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, in any event, we interpret it to refer to -- I mean, by definition they are, in a fraud-on-the-market case, alleging that they have purchased at the market price, and that's exactly what this statute would be encompassing. But beyond that, as -- as Mr. Sullivan identified, Congress' explanation of how it understood loss causation, when it -- when it enacted section 12(b) as part of the Reform Act, is entirely consistent with our position, and the common law is entirely consistent with our position.

We would go back and replead, if we were required to do that, with more specificity. We don't think that (9)(b) applies in this situation because both the Eleventh and the Third Circuits have held that (9)(b) only applies to the circumstances constituting fraud. It has never been applied to materiality, loss causation, or damages.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10672 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But surely they wanted to have a person be able to read a complaint and just understand what it's about in a securities fraud case. And I don't see how you could understand it unless you have in the complaint what your theory is. That's all. Nobody is asking for some facts. Is your theory that the loss took place at the time the person bought the stock because he overpaid $30? Is your theory that the stock went down and, because of that, he lost the money? Is your theory that the stock didn't go down but it would have gone up more? All they're asking is not for evidence, but a simple, clear explanation of the theory, and plead in the alternative if you want. But I mean, what's the problem? Why is that so hard to do?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10673 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think that's so hard to do. And you're right. We have to plead the theory, and -- and the theory is --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10674 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And this case doesn't seem to do it. I looked through the entire complaint. I found exactly two paragraphs. I didn't. My law clerk did, frankly. (Laughter.)
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10675 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But I told him to underline it. In paragraph 179, he found the word, and it caused damage. Okay? And in paragraph 177, it says the same. That's all he could find. And they were harmed. That's what it says.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10676 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And -- and you're right, Your Honor. There's not much in here. We plead the rises. There are approximately seven rises. We plead the purchases. We plead the big drop. Do we plead with specificity? The -- the losses as to AlSpiros? No. We could have done a better job. Under the Ninth Circuit, though, the law, as we pled it at the time, was that we have to plead an inflation and identify the causes. And that's what we did under Ninth Circuit law. If this Court were to decide that we had to do more, could we? Certainly. I mean, we have some of the information in there. We -- we tie AlSpiros to the sales force, which is an announcement on 2/24. You know, there's a lack of integrity in management.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10677 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But there's a -- but there -- there is a basic difference between, as was pointed out in the colloquy with Mr. Hungar -- one thing is the particularity of pleadings. Yes, you have to tell the details of the fraud. No, you don't have to tell the details of the loss. But you do have to have a theory on which you can recover, and if your theory is simply I bought at an inflated price and the law doesn't give you a claim for relief on that theory, then you're out the window. There's no discovery. There's nothing. You have to have, as Justice Souter pointed out, a viable theory of relief, and that's the difference between -- you say it's enough that the stock was selling for much more than it should have, and the other side said, no, that's not enough. You have to show that when the misrepresentation was corrected, the price dropped.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10678 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I don't think it's enough to prove that we just paid an overinflated price. You cannot recover under Ninth Circuit law unless you not only prove that you paid an inflated price, but also that you prove that inflation came out. I think where we differ from the Government and petitioners is that it -- conceptually, at least with the Government, the right framework is to analyze did the inflation come out of the stock. And our quarrel here is how can the inflation come out of the stock? Does there have to be a corrective disclosure? And we say no. Time itself can take inflation out of the stock. Company-specific information is our biggest concern. If somebody walks a stock down, so to speak, they give out information lowering expectations because stock prices are based on cash flow. If they walk it down and say, hey, our -- we're going to have a revenue miss, but they don't announce their problems with AlSpiros at the time, or we're closing some factories, or we're taking a significant write-off, that stock drops. We believe that lowers inflation. I think a good case to take a look at to illustrate this is the Wool v. Tandem case out of the Ninth Circuit. In that case, Tandem was shipping to its own warehouses for 2 years, lying about its revenues. Wool went out and bought the stock. The stock was inflated. The Wall Street Journal, subsequent to that, reported we don't see how Tandem can continue to book these revenues, and then the company itself lowered expectations in one of their SEC filings saying, hey, lower than expected revenues coming up. The stock has dropped and now Wool sells. And now then after that, it's admitted that there was a fraud. Does -- and the stock barely drops hardly at all because the expectations in that stock have already been taken out.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10679 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Why? I don't understand. I mean, there would be even more expectation taken out after the fraud is announced. I mean, it's just like saying, you know, besides -- besides fact that our CEO just died, there's no gold there. Don't you think it would go down still further?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10680 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Maybe and maybe not much. It depends on what's your cash in the bank. In this case, they had gone to the market and gotten $400 million of cash in the bank. So as the expectations were lowered with the Ceclor CD sales here not once but twice and the sales force inadequacy, before it was ever announced, they knew when the FDA was coming out. This is not the perfect situation. You're right. We could have just taken this out and --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10681 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But it sounds to me as if the things you're saying now are matters for proof, and I -- I think the wiggle room in the Government's position was it said it has to be disclosed to the market in some form or other. Well, if you're prepared to be broad and turn those over to the experts for the proof, you end up with your theory. The -- the inflation comes out and it comes out because they didn't get the earnings that they would have had or there may be many reasons.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10682 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There's no doubt, Your Honor. And if we have to do it at the pleading stage, it would be impossible.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10684 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And -- and I think we did that. We said the stock was inflated and there was damage, and we could have done a better job. Absolutely --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10685 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I thought your theory was, at least as I read your brief, that your loss occurs at the moment of purchase, not at some later time, that when you bought the stock, the price was inflated and that's when you suffered your loss, on the day of the purchase, not at a later time.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10686 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's absolutely correct. We believe that you suffer your loss and damages on the date you make the purchase. On the day --

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10691 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # -- with the notion that the loss occurred at the time your purchased?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10692 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Scalia, because those are -- what we're talking about are recoverable damages, and then there's a limitation from section 28. In other words, all the cause of action was satisfied on the date you overpay. The day you pay $100 for a stock that's worth $50, you're out the $50, the economy is out the $50 because it's not working -- it's working a fraudulent market. But you cannot recover, we would agree, until later. And the problem with analyzing that at the pleading stage is that is the -- that is expert analysis and discovery to connect up how -- how the losses came out and what you can recover. So I agree with you that you cannot recover that.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10693 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # They're saying there's no losses. I mean, that's -- it's inconsistent how the losses come out. You just told us the loss occurs, bang, when you buy it. You've gotten stock that really isn't worth what you paid for it, the notion of -- of worth as some -- you know, some objective thing rather than what -- what people are willing to pay.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10694 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, that's --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10695 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that's your theory and it seems to me you're stuck with it. And if that theory is true, then it shouldn't matter that you later sell it to some other poor, unsuspecting individual for the same amount you bought it for.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10696 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It doesn't matter for that plaintiff if they sell it to a poor -- somebody unexpected. For example, Fannie Mae just publicly, a couple of weeks ago, found out they bought $300 million worth of bonds, and they -- they found out about a fraud. They sold it and got fined by the Government because they heard about the fraud and sold it back into the market to recoup their losses or back through their broker. That's -- that's not okay. That's just one outrageous example. But somebody ends up with that stock that's inflated. Okay? And when you make the purchase. We agree we have to show the inflation come out before recovery, and -- and 90 percent of the time --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10697 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You have to show what before recovery? You have to show?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10698 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The inflation came out of the stock. In other words, if you pay $100 for a stock that's worth $50, it's inflated by $50. You don't recover that $50 until you show that $50 inflation came out of the stock. It can come out a number of ways. Let's say, for example, that somebody announced a competitive product. Well, that would take some of the inflation. That would be a market factor that would take some of the inflation out of your false statement that you had a product, the AlSpiros product. There are different ways inflation can come out besides a corrective disclosure.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10699 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Yes, but if you've got to show the inflation, then you don't have a complete cause of action the day after you buy the stock if there's no loss.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10711 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # In the most complex frauds, a -- a company is reporting revenue and earnings and their stock is, let's say, trading at $60 a share. Perhaps, because of fraud, it's overstated by $30. There are people in the market buying that stock at $60. That company starts to lower those expectations. This happens to be a real world example, Worldcom. They say we're going to miss revenues by $172 million. The stock starts dropping down. The inflation that was in that stock because of what they lied about starts coming out. Nobody knows there's fraud. Nobody understands that. In fact, it's not until that stock goes down at 80 cents that there was an admission of fraud.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10712 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # All right. But then you're not saying what I think Justice Scalia and I actually thought you were going to say which is that the minute he pays $60 for a stock that should be worth $30 but is $60 because of the lie, at that instant he suffered a loss. After listening to you, I now think you're saying -- but I'm not sure because I've heard you say things that are -- both -- I now think you're saying, no, he has not suffered a loss until later on when that $30 comes out of the price of the stock.

You know? I'd have to prove that it went to $250. I agree with you. You know, I would agree with you that, you know, that I'd get an expert.

The sales force insufficiency, as well as management integrity, and there are some other things that weren't pleaded well. First of all, we were being conservative when we pled this and we pled the rises. We pled the insider sales. We pled the stock offerings. And all the statements were in that earlier period. They make the announcement. The stock starts down, 50 percent drop. It's walked down another 40 percent after that. Finally, you get the FDA announcement. And we certainly could have, and -- and maybe should have, taken that period out right then. The district court ended up having problems with it. The Ninth Circuit, in their questionings -- Judge Reinhardt had problems with the -- with that. And they gave us leave to replead, and we told them at that time if that's what we need to do, is tie that in also, if that's a loss that we intend to recover for or seek recovery for, then we'll do that and we'll go back to replead.

And that's -- and that's a concern of ours. The Ninth Circuit law is pretty clear, is very clear actually, with the three cases, Blackie, Green, Judge Sneed in the Green v. Occidental case, and the Wool case, saying that the loss occurs at the time of purchase and overpayment, but recoverable damages --

I'm hoping that it's not clearly wrong. It's been on the books for 30 years. It was the law. It was the law on the books at the time that this was codified. There was no real or perceived conflict in the circuits at the time this was codified.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10739 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, I -- I thought that Judge Sneed recognized that if the stock was sold before any loss was incurred, even if there's been a misrepresentation, recovery should be denied.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10747 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It cited -- I thought cited Knapp and -- which, in turn, cited Gray or -- or --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10748 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There are all the appendants. There's -- there's the three that started off. Knapp is the ATV case that we tried, and that was Judge Wallace and he relied on Gray. All of them are the same in that you have to -- to get by the pleading stage, that you have to plead the inflation and identify the causes for it. It's for proof and expert testimony and discovery to see if you have recoverable damages. If this Court were to say, no, we want identifiable drops, then we could do that. You know, if this Court were to say, listen, you've got to identify the drops, whether they -- whether you can connect them up to the fraud at this time, we want a full theory in the complaint -- and we can do that. If that's what the -- if that's what this Court directs us to do, then we'll do that and we'll put in all the losses, as well as the rises, as well as identifying the causes. You know, we'll do that in -- in the complaints. Sometimes what -- what we're saying and where we differ a little bit from the Government is it's hard to necessarily tie one of those innocuous disclosures that may be taking the inflation out back to the misrepresentation, and yet the stock is dropping and inflation is coming out. And that's what we're worried about. And there are other market forces that may take it out. So at the pleading stage, we're worried about the burden that almost puts us in -- in the position of having an expert come in, and we think that's for a later time for summary judgment or trial.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10749 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I mean, if you're worried about it, why aren't you worried about it later, as well as earlier? I mean, if that's going to be a problem, we should know it sooner rather than later, rather than -- you know. If you say that's terribly difficult to prove, we can hardly ever prove it, well, good. Then let's get rid of this -- rid of the case earlier.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10750 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think I said --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10751 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I don't -- I don't know why -- why it's desirable not to include that at the pleading stage.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10752 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think I said that that was difficult or hard to prove. I said it was difficult or hard to plead. It is difficult and hard to plead, and -- and to tie that -- those inflationary things back up because you only get to recover -- you only get to recover for things that took the inflation out. I mean, if the stock drops -- let's say -- let's say the stock drops $60 or $50, and where he paid $60, it drops down to $10. But half of that -- half of that drop is unrelated to the fraud absolutely. Well, under a 10(b) cause of action, you don't get to recover for that market loss. We have to tie -- that's why Judge Sneed in Occidental -- in Green v. Occidental tied it right to the overpayment because Judge Sneed was worried about -- about the issuers being insurers for the market. In other words, if the stock -- if -- if a down market takes the stock way past what you paid over inflation, defendants should not be liable for the whole market loss as they might in a section 33 case. And that's really what the -- what the point is, to fix the loss. That's why Judge Sneed fixed the loss at the date of overpayment because Judge Sneed didn't want somebody coming in and saying, hey, you paid $60 for a stock that was really worth $30. When you brought suit, the stock was down at $10. Do you get to pay -- do you get $50? And Judge Sneed said no. You only get the overpayment on the date. Admittedly in up or down markets, what petitioners and the Government would suggest might move the damages up or down. In an up market -- you know, we're talking about something that was going down here. In an up market, you might get a bigger drop.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10754 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # That's why the term loss causation is used because under the statute it's -- it's a loss experienced by the plaintiff caused by the misrepresentation.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10763 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, but what -- it seems to me that what Judge Sneed's theory boils down to is this. You cannot recover any loss except the loss that was caused by the fraud in question. In theory, that limit is established by the inflation at the time you purchase. So that is the limit of your recovery, but it does not follow from that that you have anything to recover for until you have your actual loss if you're pleading a -- a fraud-on-the-market theory. Isn't that fair to say?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10764 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's fair to say.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10765 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10766 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I agree with that, Your Honor. That is -- that's exactly what -- that's exactly what Judge Sneed did. And when we were talking about this statute here, it talks about us proving those -- that loss causation and tying it to the actual omissions. And it follows two sections that deal with pleading, material -- deal with particularized pleading as to falsity and as to scienter. And this statute says that if you don't plead one or two with the particularity required, then the complaint shall be dismissed. This section here --
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10767 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So -- so -- I'm not sure I understand what -- I'm -- I'm really coming to believe that this is a misunderstanding. It seems to me you're now saying that the loss does not occur when you make the purchase. It is just that that is the limit on your loss, the difference between what the stock would have cost you had the -- the absence of gold been known and what you actually paid.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10768 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's the limit on your loss.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10769 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But that is not your loss. You're saying now the loss has to occur later when the price goes down and you're thereby harmed. Is that it?
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10770 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. I apologize if I haven't been clear. The loss occurs at the time you purchase, but you cannot recover any portion of the loss until the inflation is taken out.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10771 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But the -- let's approach it a different way. On a fraud-on-the-market theory, there are two facts I think that can be assumed. Number one, there was no misrepresentation that was made peculiarly to you. The misrepresentation was to the broad market and was reflected in the broad market price.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10772 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10773 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Number two, you as a purchaser do not know about the fraud until the market finds out about the fraud.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10774 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Correct.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10775 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # If that is the case, then I don't see that it makes any sense at all to talk about your having a cause of action the day after you purchase before the market has found out and before the fraud is known. I mean, this -- this strikes me as an exercise in -- in an inconsistent theory.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10776 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # And here's why it matters, if I might, is that what petitioners and perhaps the Government would say is that you're right. You don't find out about the fraud until the whole market finds out. But before you find out about the fraud, there can be terrific drops in the stock, which we think we could prove are related to the fraud. Okay? Because we've had certainly a market loss to what we paid. The stock has dropped down. We don't know about fraud yet. All of a sudden, there's a disclosure of fraud, and we all learn about it.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10777 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You don't know about it, but the market knows about it. That's -- that's why the stock has gone down.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10778 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Not necessarily, Your Honor. In other words, you can lower expectations by lower revenue numbers. Other market forces like a competitor coming out with a product. There are other things that can lower that. I'm sorry. And when it gets down there, the rule that we fear is being urged is that you only get the drop from either the admission of the fraud or the full disclosure of the fraud, and in the complex cases, the Enrons, the Worldcoms, the Healthsouths of the world, that didn't happen even until long after they were in bankruptcy. And if we only get the drop, the $3 drop at the end, or the 80 cents to 50 cents that the Government just returned $750 million to in the Worldcom, with every large institution in the country already out of that stock, well, then those that were sought to be protected by the Reform Act aren't. We have to be able to plead certainly -- and -- and we can -- the -- the market moving down. And then that's at the pleading stage, a plain 8(a) statement. And then we have to prove and tie that back up to get damages.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10779 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I thought that that's what the Government was getting at in the passage I read earlier where they don't make it -- there must be a statement by the issuer of the correction. They have more leeway. But you -- the Ninth Circuit -- the litany that it's using, the -- the set of cases -- for example, plaintiffs were harmed when they paid more for the stock than it was worth. The -- the notion that's repeated, that your loss is established on the day you purchase the price, that's just wrong, and I think we would have to at a minimum say that.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10780 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I don't agree with that, Your Honor.

argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10782 # TRUE # MR. COUGHLIN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Can you recover? Is it like the UCC where you've got to mitigate your damages? You cannot recover those damages even though you've suffered them. You have a stock certificate that's worth half of what it's worth even in an efficient market. And when the truth comes out, that's true, you'll be damaged, and if you sell it before then, you get no recovery.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10783 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But aren't -- aren't you -- aren't you, in -- in effect, equating two different things: one, a loss that you suffer which you say occurs immediately upon purchase of the inflated stock; and on the other hand, a limit on the loss that is attributable to the fraud? Those are two different things. I understand the limit on the loss. I don't understand the -- the suffering of the loss in fact.
argument in Dura Pharmaceuticals against Broudo # 03-932 # 10784 # TRUE # MR.

I just want to close by saying the loss causation codification in the Reform Act was meaningful and was part of the Reform Act. And that really indicates that this is a pleading standard that we -- we -- we're dealing with, that the cause of action for a securities fraud has to be stated at the time. And that's consistent with what the Reform Act was trying to achieve which is to give the defendants a chance to respond and actually have the motion to dismiss serve as a meaningful screen in dealing with those cases.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10802 # FALSE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Court has directed us to address, in addition to the question raised in the petition for writ of certiorari, the following question. Was petitioner's Federal constitutional claim properly raised before the Mississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 United States Code, section 1257? Accordingly, we begin by addressing that question and answering it affirmatively. Here, Howell maintains, one, the standards for adjudicating State and Federal claims of this particular type are identical --

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10804 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- where they're labeled as such --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10805 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- where was that -- where was that maintained? Because I thought that below, all there were was this was a -- was it a lesser-included offense under State law, and I didn't see below any reference to the Federal Constitution.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10806 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Ginsburg, we believe that the rule in Beck establishes that State law must be viewed and State law is the determiner of whether an offense is a lesser-included offense, but Federal law, the Federal Constitution determines whether, as a matter of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Eighth Amendment concerns, whether an instruction must be given as a Federal constitutional matter.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10807 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And -- and the standards under Beck are different from the standards under the roughly comparable State rule, as I understand it, because under the State rule, the lesser offense need not be an included offense, in the technical sense; and number two, there need not be, in the absence of a further instruction, a -- a limitation to the jury to two choices, death or acquittal, so that unless one is very careful to raise the Federal standard, simply raising the State standard wouldn't do it.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10808 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Respectfully, Justice Souter, we would submit that Mississippi's own law says that it embraces the Beck standard and that Mississippi's own law --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10809 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Sure, it embraces it because it's broader, which means that if you raise -- if you -- if you make a claim under the State standard, you are not necessarily making a claim under the narrower, more restrictive Federal standard.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10810 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We would respectfully submit that -- that in Mississippi, for example, as contrasted with the statutory scheme that was present in Hopkins, the Nebraska scheme, in the Mississippi scheme, Mississippi has held that simple murder is a lesser-included offense, and therefore, by definition that offense at least mirrors what is required under Beck. Now, the question of whether some other lesser --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10811 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # What about -- what about the -- the Beck condition that in the absence of the instruction, there must be a choice between -- the jury must be confined to a choice between death and acquittal?

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10813 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That's -- that's not the same in the State's scheme, is it?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10814 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we believe that -- that it is the same. And in fact, the -- the case that the State cites, State v. Goodin, explains that. The representation of Goodin in the State's brief, as it appears in the respondent's brief at page 23, we contend is not faithfully representative of what the Court said in that case.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10815 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Is -- is Goodin the case that -- that stands for the proposition that under -- under State law, the -- the jury has an -- an option to sentence for life, as -- as well as -- as to impose the death sentence?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10816 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Goodin is the case that the State cited for that purpose, but an analysis of what the Mississippi Supreme Court actually said at page 656 of the Southern Reporter, 787, is this. The Goodin jury did not face the dilemma of the Beck jury. Here, the jury's alternatives in the guilt phase were to convict Goodin of capital murder, simple murder, or to acquit him, which is the very purpose that the later cases -- and Beck itself explains. Schad, for example, explains that the reason for the Beck determination was that presenting only the option of convicting of a capital offense or acquitting was not constitutionally permissible.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10817 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So -- so I just want to make sure I know where we stand. You're saying that the assumption I was making, that under Mississippi law, in the absence of an instruction for a lesser offense, the jury has an option not only to acquit or to impose the death penalty, but an option of life with or without parole, that assumption is simply incorrect as a -- as a fact about Mississippi law.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10818 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, I do not believe that is incorrect. I'm sorry, Your Honor. What I do believe is correct is that under Mississippi law, the jury, because of the bifurcated nature of the -- of the case, is given at least the preliminary reference or preliminary instruction that if there is a guilt verdict, then there will be a sentencing phase. But we submit that that is a distinction that this Court has not adopted, nor have other courts adopted because in this situation --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10819 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But it takes you out of Beck, at least arguably, doesn't it? The -- the question is, have you raised something that is necessarily on all fours with Beck? And given this sentencing scheme, we can't say that simply raising a State claim necessarily raises the Beck claim. Isn't that true?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10820 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, we would respectfully disagree with that position because of the analysis that the Court has undertaken, for example, in Hopkins and because of the analysis in Spaziano v. Florida. In those cases, they were presented with schemes in which the jury did not, of necessity, impose the death penalty. However, the jury was confronted with exactly the same position --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10821 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But the consequence of the jury verdict was -- was the death penalty.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10822 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, the consequence of the jury verdict may have been the death penalty. For example, in Spaziano, the -- the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The jury recommended life, but the judge imposed a sentence of death nevertheless. In the Hopkins case, the -- a three-judge panel then imposed the death penalty. Those -- those differences in sentencing schemes we do not believe separates the rationale of Beck which is the danger of affecting the jury verdict by being faced with the dilemma of either convicting of a capital offense or acquitting.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10823 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Mr. Mitchell, my -- my problem is even more fundamental than Justice Souter's. Conceding that the rule in Mississippi is exactly the same as the Federal rule in Beck, it doesn't seem to me that arguing Mississippi law, just because it happens to be the same as Federal law, amounts to raising a Federal question. Let's assume you have a -- a State law against wire-tapping. It is unlawful. And you -- you come in and you ask that the evidence be -- be excluded because it's contrary to the State law. Have you raised a -- a Federal -- a Federal question when all you cite is the State law, even though the effect under State law is the same as the Federal effect under the Fourth Amendment?

That's untenable and that raises a Federal question. Would the State then concede that that was a sufficient assertion of a Federal constitutional claim? Probably not, and that is because the State contends, just as the amicus brief contends, that this Court should adopt some inflexible rule that is extremely and extraordinarily difficult to apply in the context of, for example, a trial in Mississippi or North Carolina where counsel understands the lifeblood of the rule, the lifeblood even of the Constitution, but cannot at the moment recall the correct citation.

He gets to this issue, which is somewhere hidden among the 28, and what it says is, there should have been a lesser-included offense instruction and it cites three Mississippi cases, which in turn cite one other case, and that -- that other case says that the Mississippi rule has constitutional implications and cites Beck. Well, I mean, if that's supposed to be sufficient, I as a judge would have to, in every one of these cases that's cited in these 28 different issues, start looking up the other cases in Mississippi to see if there's some other place they cite some other case that says something about a Federal case. I mean, you see it's impossible.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10865 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Mr. Mitchell, what gives me pause is that there are Mississippi cases -- you no doubt know them -- where the court has seemed to think that the Federal issue under Beck was discrete from the State issue. So I forgot the name of them, but one of them was striking because it says this doesn't run afoul of Beck, and then it says, now we turn to Mississippi law on lesser-included offense. And it -- the -- the State supreme court treated those two as discrete. So when you just say lesser-included offense, why should the Court assume that you're talking about one rather than the other when the Mississippi Supreme Court itself has made it clear that it thinks they are discrete inquiries?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10866 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Ginsburg, we would respectfully submit that -- that the State's recitation of Goodin is not a faithful representation of what happened in Goodin. In Goodin, he was -- the defendant was given the lesser-included simple murder instruction, which Howell seeks. It was a robbery case. The report of the case appears at 787 So.2d, beginning, I believe it's, 639. At pages 655 and 656, the court addresses the Beck issue, and it says there that because the jury's alternative in the guilt phase was either to convict of capital murder or simple murder or to acquit, then and in that circumstance, the Beck -- that Beck was not violated. It then says we must look to our practice to determine whether a manslaughter instruction should be given. And it is for that reason that we respectfully submit that Goodin does not attempt to distinguish Beck, but in fact squarely addresses a Beck claim, although -- and we candidly admit -- Goodin's counsel did cite Beck itself to the Mississippi court. Nevertheless, the claim was phrased in precisely the same manner in which Mr. Howell's counsel expressed the same claim. These claims, therefore, we would respectfully contend, are not virtually identical but are in fact identical. But even if there were some minor variations, some deviations, as this Court indicated would appear from time to time, we contend that clearly that such identity, such virtual identity is sufficient to raise the issue. In this case, Howell's trial and appellate counsel raised two issues with regard to the jury instructions. Those two issues themselves were interrelated. Those two issues were a whole. Those issues related to whether or not there was sufficient evidence to convict of robbery and whether or not -- or attempted robbery rather, and whether or not there was a basis to give a lesser-included instruction. The cases which he cites are State cases related to the necessity of giving lesser-included instructions where there's an attempted robbery and simple murder is, therefore, included in that offense. He also, at the outset of his contentions with regard to jury instructions, says that under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, these jury instructions -- and we contend that they must be considered as a whole. These jury instructions violate his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. It is our position that this is sufficient -- while not a cognate of that, is sufficient to at least be a corresponding claim, a substantially identical claim to Beck, and one which entitles the defendant as a matter of due process and as a matter of Eighth Amendment consideration and concern, to an instruction. The difficulty that we face in a circumstance such as this where the instruction is not given is that the jury's function, while not always reviewable, but which is always entitled to protection, may be called into question and the quality of the verdict impeached, in effect, by the failure to have the third option. In essence, it is our contention that where a defendant uses the very words that this Court has used to describe the constitutional claim, where it uses the very words that the State supreme court has used --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10867 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # May I ask you this question, Mr. Mitchell? Supposing the -- there are alternative lesser-included offenses that might be urged by the defendant as to -- to get an instruction on, and he asks for the wrong one. In other words, the question -- there is a question here about exactly what is the lesser-included offense. It seems to me that if he tried to kill -- if he killed the driver of the vehicle, there may well have been some kind of crime. But maybe you ask for a lesser-included offense of, say, simple murder and the facts don't fit simple murder, but they might fit manslaughter or something else. Would your request for -- for a simple murder, lesser-included offense instruction be sufficient if you should really have asked for a different lesser-included offense instruction?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10868 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We would respectfully submit that -- that even the Mississippi court has addressed that situation in -- in a case cited in -- in the briefs in Mease. And there, the defendant asked five times for instructions, lesser-included offense instructions, and never actually got them right. The court said that that is not a basis upon which to deny the instruction and then, citing Beck, said that where there is a proper lesser-included offense, the fact that the -- that the defendant does not request the proper instruction still rises to the constitutional proportions that a Beck claim does.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10869 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Is -- is that the case here too? One of the things that's neither here nor there I guess, but one of the things that perplexed me was that I would have thought that the lesser-included offense on -- on the theory that the -- that he didn't intend to kill, he was sprayed with mace, got mad, pulled out a gun, and shot and so on -- I would have thought the lesser-included offense was a heat of passion kind of killing. But as -- as I read the -- the statement of -- of simple murder, which requires a deliberate act, that didn't sound like it. And I -- I read negligent homicide, and that didn't sound like heat of passion. But is -- is it your point here, if -- if we get into it, that as long as you asked for some lesser-includeds, under Mississippi law that raises the issue adequately?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10870 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We -- we believe that it does raise it adequately. We believe that it --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10871 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But then what would be a lesser-included offense? Because if it's not simple murder and it's not manslaughter, you haven't suggested a third that it might be. I thought your whole position was that this simple murder was right and the --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10872 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We do contend that it was right, Your Honor.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10873 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- and the judge was obliged to give it. So why -- in view of what Justice Souter just said about simple murder requiring a deliberate design, where was the deliberate design here?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10874 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We believe that -- that there are, in effect, two forms of simple murder because of the structure of -- and in fact, the Mississippi Supreme Court has said this -- because of the structure of the Mississippi murder definitions. They are contained in a number of separate sections, but the most important of which is that a killing, not done in certain enumerated felonies, such as robbery or attempt to rob, would constitute simple murder. We believe that the simple murder instruction would have been correct. But even if it were not, we would respectfully submit that that is sufficient to raise the question.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10875 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But what would be if it were not? What would be the lesser-included offense?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10876 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Arguably it would be manslaughter. For example, the Mease case, which the State cites and to which I made reference, was a case in which capital murder was not robbery murder as in this case, but the killing of a police officer. In Mease, there was an altercation between the sheriff and Mease. During that altercation, Mease was struck on the head by another deputy. His contention was that the gun fired, which he was holding next to the sheriff's neck. The gun fired by reaction for two reasons, one that he was in a fight and, secondly, that he was struck. The Mease court said that that was a proper basis to instruct on manslaughter, the fact that he had pulled the gun and was using it during the course of the fight. Now, while I find that case difficult to parse, we believe that that certainly could have been an argument that could have been raised and that, albeit it was not, it could have been a proper instruction to have been given. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10879 # FALSE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: I'd like to make the point, as far as jurisdiction goes, that -- that the defendant has failed to make a Federal claim and he is required under Webb v. Webb. If the Mississippi Supreme Court -- if the lower court does not address the issue, then it is assumed that it was not properly raised. As to the issue of Beck, there is no Beck violation. Actually Mississippi finally -- we've gotten in one instance, we've -- we've become first in -- in this regard. In Jackson v. State in 1976, our Supreme Court -- which was cited in a footnote 10, I believe, in -- in Beck. In the Jackson case, Mississippi said -- we had the same statute, pretty much, that Alabama had that restricted a lesser-included offense instruction. Mississippi said, number one, you cannot restrict that lesser-included offense instruction if it is supported by the facts, and number two, in the Jackson case, the court held that it had to be bifurcation, which was the problem, the impact on the guilt phase. And -- and so I would submit to the Court that there is no impact in Mississippi in this case on the guilt phase, nothing to influence the jurors' decision, and that was the inherent problem that the Court recognized in Beck. Number two, Mississippi allows a life sentence, which also distinguishes Beck. It -- it allows the jury, in a separate, bifurcated hearing, to determine whether or not the defendant should receive life or the death penalty. And then thirdly, in Mississippi, we have a broader standard than the Federal standard. If it's any lesser offense in Mississippi, then the defendant is entitled to it if it's supported by the facts of the case. So we have a broader standard that gives the defendant an easier opportunity to meet that standard. And thirdly --

And I would submit to the Court that if we are analyzing a Federal constitutional issue, then perhaps we -- we should follow Federal constitutional standards, which was stated -- the strict elements test, in other words, because under -- under Federal law, it has to be, well, number one, a lesser-included offense, a true lesser-included offense, and under the Schmoke case, this Court has stated that that is in fact applying the strict elements --

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10913 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It would not be murder.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10914 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No. So it would be something. What would it be?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10915 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It could arguably be a felony murder, which is a separate statute in Mississippi.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10916 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # All right. So then maybe there's a felony --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10917 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # He meant to commit another --

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10922 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # I mean, it's odd that in Mississippi people just go around shooting each other all the time and there's no statute that seems to cover it. (Laughter.)

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10927 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But, of course, it's premeditation. If there were evidence, say, for example --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10928 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No, no, no. They just do it -- who knows why. All we know about them is they went and killed somebody. Now, I think it's still a crime to kill people in, I thought, all 50 States, but -- but -- (Laughter.)
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10929 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So I'm going to say which --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10930 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Let's make it -- if we make it concrete, let's take all that we have in this case is the testimony that Rice gave. Rice was the one who observed this murder, and he didn't have any statements about the defendant needing money to pay off his debt. You have only that snapshot scene of what the witness saw from the window, which doesn't establish any robbery at all because Rice said he didn't observe any robbery going on. All he observed was the killing. Now, if that's all you have in this case, a person was killed, an eyewitness to the shooting, the eyewitness testifies exactly as Mr. Rice did in this case, what crime would you indict for?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10931 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, to -- to -- first of all, we wouldn't have indicted for capital murder if we didn't have that evidence. We wouldn't be discussing the Beck issue. It wouldn't be a lesser-included offense question. We'd strictly be focusing on those facts, number one, that particular witness Rice was on the other side of the vehicle. You had separate testimony from Lipsey, the co-defendant who was in the vehicle and could -- behind where -- where --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10932 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Yes, but I'm giving you a hypothetical where --

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10934 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Yes. All you have --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10935 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # The question is that's -- one witness is all you had. Would there be a crime against the law of Mississippi and if so, what would it be?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10936 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It would be manslaughter, I suppose, Your Honor. That's not the facts in this case and -- and I apologize --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10937 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Okay. So what -- but -- but the line of reasoning is -- is -- now, there is a crime. Let's call it X. All right? And what you're -- what counsel says is it's the law of Mississippi that if there is a crime and it's X and it's lesser, you've got to charge it if somebody just says, please give me a lesser-included instruction, even if he's all mixed up as to what the right crime is. I don't know if that's the law of Mississippi. From reading the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion, I would say it wasn't the law of Mississippi because they say you're not supposed to charge people in ways that would mix them up. But, I mean, anyway -- but that's the argument. So what's the response?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10938 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10939 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # And don't take the one I just suggested because I'm not sure that's right. What is your response?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10940 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There are 12 separate manslaughter sections in the Mississippi code, not in one section. Our murder section lists -- lists four just in one section. There are 12 different ones. We have one if you drive a nail in a tree and -- and you're -- you're cutting lumber and it kills someone, that's a manslaughter still. This defendant only requested a culpable negligence manslaughter instruction. There was no evidence to -- to support that. The only potentially -- I -- I could even make a stretch -- would be a heat of passion. He did not request that -- request instruction, and --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10941 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, is that fatal to him? I mean, that's what we're -- one of the things we're trying to get at I guess. Is -- is that fatal to him?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10942 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # His failure to request --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10943 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Under Mississippi law, would he be entitled to a lesser offense instruction if he asked for the wrong lesser offense? I.e., in this case, if he failed to ask for heat of passion, would he still be entitled to a correct lesser instruction, even when he didn't ask for it?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10944 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Perhaps the judge should correct within a particular statute, but not go look at all 12 statutes that he's under -- which -- which would classify as murder.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10945 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So you say he's not entitled then.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10946 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10947 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # The -- the only thing he would be entitled to, if he were correct, is the lesser instruction that he asked for, and if he's not correct, there's no error.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10948 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir. He would have had to -- to have specifically requested heat of passion. But there again, I don't believe that he put on evidence to support even --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10949 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No. We're just trying to get at what Mississippi law is, and I think you've --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10950 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # And under your view of the facts, as I understand it, he would have been entitled to a manslaughter instruction.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10954 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # And the question is we don't know exactly which of your several statutory provisions it violated, but if it violated one of them, I don't understand. And if he's correct -- maybe he misrepresents the law. He tells us, as a matter of State law, if he asked for the wrong lesser-included instruction, but there is a correct one, the judge has a duty to give the correct instruction. That's what -- what the counsel has told us. And if that's right, I don't understand why he wasn't entitled to some lesser-included offense instruction.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10955 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I -- I believe what he was addressing was language within a particular statute, meaning a lesser-included offense of -- of murder or how you styled it, whether it be depraved heart murder or -- or felony murder, first degree murder.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10956 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # So it's -- it's your view he must ask for the correct lesser-included offense instruction.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10957 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir. And -- and there again, I'd like for the Court to -- to understand my statement that we should construe this on what -- how the Federal law -- how you -- how the Federal courts construe it, not use Mississippi's lesser standard, but let's -- let's construe it on whether or not, first, it is a true lesser-included offense because that's -- that's what the Federal standard is, and that's what we followed in Nebraska. And secondly, if it's a true lesser-included offense, we have to use the analysis of the Federal courts which says that it has to use the strict elements test. Well, murder would not be a lesser-included offense under Federal law because under the Mississippi capital murder statute can be with or without deliberate design. Therefore, there is no deliberate design. It would not be a lesser-included offense of murder. Manslaughter would not be a lesser-included offense under that same elements test because it requires the additional element of sudden provocation or heat of passion. So I would submit to the Court, if we apply what's fair under Federal law, what the floor is under Federal law, we should use the Federal analysis and not Mississippi --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10958 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But is sudden provocation or heat of passion part of the prosecution's burden or a part of his -- one of the -- is it a matter of defense?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10959 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It would be a matter of the defense raising sudden provocation. And I don't believe that they -- they certainly didn't put on anything about culpable negligence. For example, maybe he was spinning the gun in his hand for culpable negligence. They didn't put on anything about deliberate design because he didn't want to testify. His defense was alibi and so he didn't take the stand and say, I intended to kill this person, therefore, give me the murder instruction. He's got to put on evidence to support it, and I don't believe he put on sufficient evidence for either of those. And -- and I was the district attorney who tried this case, so factually I -- I remember the -- the -- my argument was that we couldn't have proved murder if we had wanted to because there was no premeditation.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10960 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # May I go back to the heat of passion point? You say he did not put on evidence, but wasn't there evidence in the record through a State's witness that at least would have supported a heat of passion argument, the evidence being that he went up to the car, no gun was apparent, something happened. Evidence shows that he was sprayed with mace, and at that point, he pulls out a gun and shoots. That, I suppose, is evidence of heat of passion. Couldn't he have asked for a heat of passion instruction even though he did not put on the heat of passion evidence himself?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10961 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # He could have asked for a heat of passion instruction, but --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10962 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Okay, but he did not do so.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10963 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # -- but he did not do so. Yes, sir. That -- those facts --

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10975 # TRUE # MR.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10981 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Twelve different, and one of them is simply killing somebody simpliciter, without any provocation. Right?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10982 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir, without. But he requested the culpable negligent manslaughter instruction, and there was no evidence of culpable negligent manslaughter. It's a separate section in our code now. There are 12 different sections. It's not like we have one statute that lists all of those. And -- and some of them are -- are arcane. And I think it's unfair to ask a trial court judge to correct every request for an instruction and -- and -- he -- at trial, if you read --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10983 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, let -- let me ask -- ask you this. Knowing what we know now, we have the record, we have the benefit of hindsight, we know the evidence, in your view now what would have been the closest lesser-included offense for which an instruction might have been sought?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10984 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # There are two possibilities that were not requested. One is our felony -- felony murder. Felony murder is -- is the killing of -- that occurs without occurring with one of the seven offenses that we have listed, murder, rape, and so forth, committing another crime. Or heat of passion manslaughter. And I would submit to the Court that -- that they never requested anything about the felony murder and they never requested the heat of passion manslaughter.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10985 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # May I ask this question just to help me sort of -- what are the -- as a matter of State law, what are the elements of the offense for which he was convicted?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10986 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Elements of the offense are that he -- that he -- a killing occurred with or without intent and that it was in the commission of -- of a crime, robbery.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10987 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Those are the two elements. And so that if you take out with -- in the commission of another crime and just left the -- the other part of it, would that also be an offense?

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10994 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir. If you just take those away and you just have those two elements, with or without, if it's with intent, then it would be classified as murder. If it's without, it could possibly be -- without intent, then it could be classified as manslaughter.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10995 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # It seems to me that then there are two lesser-included offenses, and either one would have -- he should have gotten an instruction on both.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10998 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir, I understand. But there again, if we go back to what the Federal standards are, we're talking about what the United States Constitution requires, and therefore, I would submit to the Court that we should apply what the Federal law is. And that law is -- number one, is it a lesser-included offense? Using the elements test, murder is not a lesser-included offense to capital murder, and the reason being is because capital murder is with or without intent and you add an additional element of murder which requires intent. Same goes for manslaughter because you had the additional sudden provocation element. So I would say that if we follow the Federal standard and -- and that's -- that's the floor, and the floor is it's got to be a lesser-included offense, it -- it's not a -- a lesser-included offense. So therefore that should answer the question. Secondly, under the Federal standard, you have to prove that -- that the court -- the judge has to decide that the -- a reasonable juror would acquit of the greater offense and also convict of the lesser. Well, Mississippi law does not require that, but I -- I'd submit to the Court that -- that after the Beck decision in 1980, our supreme court in the case of In re Jordan -- they applied the Federal standard. They required that -- when they analyzed Beck, they applied the Federal standard, in other words, the -- the part about that you have to acquit. You have to acquit on -- on the greater offense. And they also included the lesser-included offense language in that Beck analysis. So, therefore, had he properly raised the jurisdictional issue -- there's nowhere in the record does he cite Beck. There's nowhere in the record that he states facts that would even support Beck. So had he even properly reached that issue and -- and cited Beck, I would submit to the Court that the facts don't support it under Mississippi law. The facts don't support it under Federal law. And it doesn't meet the lesser-included offense standard.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 10999 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # May -- may I ask you? I'm unclear on -- on lesser-included in Mississippi. And I'm going to take this step by step.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11001 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # And tell me if I'm right or wrong at each step.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11003 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # All right. Now, his claim -- let's assume he claims this. There is evidence from -- from which you -- you could infer that he wasn't committing a crime. He may or may not be right, but let's assume that's his claim, and let's assume the judge says, yes, there's some evidence that would indicate that he wasn't up there robbing at the time he stood next to the car. Assume the judge accepts that. He then says, on that assumption, I want a lesser-included offense instruction of simple murder, killing with intent. Is that a lesser-included offense under -- under capital murder?

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11006 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, sir. And -- and I would say that under the Federal standard, clearly it's not a lesser-included offense. I would say under the State --

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11020 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # It has to be murder with intent, and that's why you say it's not a lesser-included offense because for plain murder, you need intent, and for felony murder, you don't need intent.

argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11026 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Okay. I understand you now. Let -- let me ask you this as a matter of -- on -- on the second point, as a matter of Mississippi law. Under the charge of capital murder, was there a possibility of sentencing to life or life without parole, as well as the possibility of the death penalty upon conviction?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11027 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir, and that's why I would submit to the Court it distinguishes --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11028 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Okay. So that's the second reason why it would not fall within the -- the Beck rule.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11029 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11030 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Okay.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11031 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I'd like to also point out factually that in the -- in the -- initially in the petition, the -- and actually at trial and at the Mississippi Supreme Court, they talked about that the defendant may have been able -- may have been out there selling drugs to the defendant. I'd submit to the Court that a proper review of the record, if you look at the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion at page 98 and -- 97 and 98 and page 40, the defendant in his own brief admits that that was not in evidence. It came from the -- from a plea where the -- where one of the co-defendants pled, and it never was placed before the jury. Here in -- in the brief in this particular case, they talk about, well, he -- maybe he was borrowing money, the sting question, whether he was borrowing money. That comment came from one of the witnesses named Powell who was merely speculating. I don't know what he was talking about a sting, but it could have been that he was going to borrow money or -- or rob somebody. So that -- that was speculation. So the -- the facts just don't support the granting of a lesser-included offense in this particular case. I'd also like to ask the Court to -- to note that in Hopkins v. Reeves in footnote 7, the -- the Court suggests that we don't decide that -- that particular case based upon the bifurcation issue alone. I would ask that the Court answer that question in this particular case and state that Beck has no application in this particular case because the danger that occurred and the Court's concern with in Beck is not -- doesn't happen here in the Mississippi instance because in Jackson v. State, we had already said that you have a bifurcated hearing --
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11032 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, but -- but it is true that -- that there's a difference between becoming eligible for the death penalty, on the one hand, and not being eligible on the other. And conceivably the Beck concern is triggered when the failure to give a lesser-included offense gives the jury the option of -- no other option other than convicting of a capital offense.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11033 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, I -- I would respectfully disagree. We believe that the -- the Beck issue is just with this question. You have a choice of guilt and death penalty or acquittal. This question that they're raising is conviction, not death penalty, or acquittal. And those are separate issues.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11034 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # -- an offense for which the death penalty is the punishment.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11035 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Yes, sir, but it doesn't impact the guilt phase, and that was what the problem was, I believe, in Beck, was that -- that a jury might not -- they don't want to turn him loose because -- and they give him a conviction, which automatically carries the death penalty. And that impacts the jury. And I understand that. That was a proper decision, but that just didn't happen here in this particular case. And Mississippi has just distinguished Beck. I don't believe that they properly raise this Court's jurisdiction. They never cite Beck. They never raised -- they never said due process.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11036 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # No, but if the jurors' concern is that you either have to acquit them or -- we want to make sure he never walks out of prison again, and the only way to do that is to convict him of a capital offense so the judge can impose the death penalty. I don't know why that Beck wouldn't be triggered on those facts.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11037 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, maybe I don't understand the question correctly. But in Beck, you know, the jury wasn't told that the judge would have a separate option of denying the death penalty. In this case, judge in State's -- court instruction C-5, the court says you are not to consider the sentence, that you only consider the issue of guilt or innocence of the charge. And so that's why I say this is not a Beck issue because it doesn't impact the -- the jury's determination in the guilt phase.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11038 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, it seems to me that works against you because it takes away from the jury the option of saying, well, we'll convict him of a serious offense, but we'll be sure not to give him a capital offense. So that -- it seems to me that that argument then works against you.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11039 # TRUE # MR. HOOD # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Justice Kennedy, in Mississippi, we have, there again, that open standard, not the Federal standard. And we would give him that instruction and give that jury that option if the facts support it, and I respectfully submit to the Court that -- that the facts do not support a lesser-included offense under these facts. If the Court has no further questions, thank you.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11040 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Thank you, General Hood. Mr. Mitchell, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11042 # FALSE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and -- and may it please the Court: With regard to the argument that the State makes here that these individuals had ridden around all night with a plan to rob and that, therefore, there were no other -- there was no other possibility for the court to consider in -- in granting instructions, first, it is our contention that both Mississippi law and due process law requires a judge to instruct a jury on all of the relevant issues in the case, on all the relevant law in the case. And in Fairchild v. State, that is precisely what the Mississippi court did in saying that a court could not simply conclude, no matter how strong the evidence of attempt to rob or plan to rob, that it could, in effect, direct a verdict and not instruct on lesser-included offenses.
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11043 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, your -- were the two principal lesser-included offenses in -- in your view your D-13 and D-18 that are in the appendix?
argument in Howell against Mississippi # 03-9560 # 11044 # TRUE # MR. MITCHELL # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Your Honor, those are the ones that were -- were, in fact, raised. We believe that rather than intent the -- on the simple murder, that the issue is malice as opposed to intent. The statutory definition, for example, of manslaughter in -- in Mississippi statute 97-3 -- I believe -27 is a killing of a human being without malice and while not in the commission of these felonies. Now, it may be that simply a small-town lawyer from -- from North Carolina is told don't go to the big city and get stung by some guy coming up to you and saying, you know, I just got off the bus and I need to get some money from you and my kids and my wife are waiting for me in the hotel room. But that happens not only in the big city, it also happens in Mississippi. And so there was a basis in which a jury could reasonably infer that there was a reason to approach that vehicle other than an attempted robbery. And the question is, what is a reasonable inference? The Mississippi court here in its opinion said that there was clearly evidence from which a jury could infer robbery. We concede that, but there were also other inferences that this evidence raised, and that evidence, we respectfully submit, mandated a lesser-included offense instruction. We also contend that -- that the State has not, heretofore, raised any issue about Beck's continuing vitality, but we respectfully submit that Beck is of continuing vitality. Just a -- a survey of even habeas corpus cases from the various circuits will show that the circuits are continuing to apply Beck even in States where the statutory sentencing scheme is far different from Beck and there is no preclusive statute involved, as there was in Alabama. We respectfully submit that the language in Beck itself speaks to this issue. The Beck court added, the same reasoning must apply to rules that diminish the reliability of the -- the guilt determination, the very point that Justice Kennedy pointed out undercuts Mississippi's argument. It is this diminution of the reliability of the guilt determination that is at issue here. In addition to that, we would respectfully submit that under these circumstances, there was a basis under which a lesser-included offense instruction was mandated because Beck did not apply the Blockburger test. In fact, it did not incorporate Blockburger, did not refer to Mullaney v. Wilbur. What it did was it said if there is a lesser-included offense, as defined by State law. All of the succeeding cases from this Court have said if there is a lesser-included offense, as defined by State law, conceding that State law is the applicable standard then and not the standard that the State now seeks to impose, which it never raised in -- in its brief, which it has never asserted to be the standard. Blockburger is certainly not cited in anything that the State has submitted. Blockburger is not contended to be the basis, nor could it be. The basis is is there a lesser-included offense under State law, and we contend that that is the basis on which this case should be decided. Thank you very much.

He actually -- the first petition raised only an ineffectiveness claim. The second petition raised a due process challenge to the colloquy, which was not exhausted in the first, raised new evidence to support the claim which Pennsylvania law allowed him to do, and raised a constitutional and State law challenge to the legality of his sentence. There were new claims in the second proceeding.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11064 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- of both claims was, however he dressed it up in -- in due process, that I wasn't told at the time of my sentencing that life meant life without parole.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11068 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Both times.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11069 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In -- in the second he raised that plus that the colloquy itself was defective and that the sentence, the life without parole sentence, was illegal and unconstitutional, apart from the misinformation aspect. So they were different claims. Let me start with statutory tolling. Section 2244(d)(2) of AEDPA provides tolling during properly filed applications for State post-conviction review. Under this Court's unanimous decision in Artuz, Mr. Pace's PCRA petition was properly filed. In fact, the PCRA time bar functions in all material ways like the New York State procedural bar rules at issue in Artuz. Now, Artuz also identified some types of rules that would prevent an application from being properly filed, for example, the AEDPA successive bar which makes you go to the court of appeals first and get permission before you can actually file in the district court, and it has a screening mechanism to make sure that only petitions with a prima facie chance get filed. The PCRA time bar is nothing like that at all. It's like the State court procedural bar rules in Artuz. There's no condition to filing. You can go and file at any time. The court, as a matter of law, has to take your petition, has to give it judicial review -- yes, Your Honor.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11070 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Mr. Wycoff, are you taking the position that this -- that Artuz -- I thought, frankly, that Artuz had classified within properly filed timely filed and then had a footnote, and it says that there might be some exceptions to a timely filing rule --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11071 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11072 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- rule. And they're not taking a position about that. But you quickly said this time limitation falls under the procedural bar label.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11073 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm sorry, Your Honor. Yes. This -- Artuz said that a time limit without exception, say, in 30 days you must file in 30 days, no exception, or in 1 year, no exceptions -- that's what Artuz called a condition to filing and that you're either in or you're out in that rule. And Artuz, though, reserved the question presented here of whether a time bar with exceptions, like the PCRA time bar -- whether that could be properly filed. And so obviously, Artuz reserved the exact question here. But what -- the analysis of Artuz controls here and shows that this petition was properly filed.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11074 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, it depends on what the exceptions are. If -- if -- as -- here I understand there are three exceptions.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11075 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11076 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And they're all spelled out in the statute.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11077 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They're similar to the AEDPA exceptions.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11078 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Yes. And -- and if you do not plead any of those exceptions when you -- when you file, it seems to me it's not properly filed.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11079 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there are a couple of responses to that, Your Honor. First of all, in -- in terms of Mr. Pace, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has said it wasn't at all clear before, roughly, December of 1999 that you actually need to plead those exceptions in your petition. Now they say you should plead them in your petition, but at the time it wasn't clear. Certainly the -- the form that the prison provides --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11080 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I don't care what the Pennsylvania law is. I mean, it -- it seems to me if you have a statute that says it's untimely unless one of these three exceptions apply, and -- and you -- you simply file and you don't say -- and it's clearly out of time without one of the exceptions, and you simply file and don't say but this exception applies, it seems to me that's not properly filed, whatever the rule in -- in Pennsylvania was.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11081 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If -- in terms of -- to go to Artuz' analysis, you would have to look at each -- the exceptions are -- go claim by claim. You would have to look at each claim and see did you plead the exception for this claim, yes or no; this claim, yes or no. So again --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11082 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But you haven't pleaded any of them, none at all. You just file it --

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11118 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- are there States, do you know, where that is not required and the State court will go through the exceptions even if you haven't pled them?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11119 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Pennsylvania actually does that and certainly did it at the time Mr. Pace was litigating.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11125 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I -- I don't know the answer to that. I know that was the practice. In -- in fact, Pennsylvania courts still do that.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11126 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And you say that if that's the case, you can file a -- a State -- a State claim that is plainly no good and until the State court finally gets around to -- to telling you that it's no good, your -- your AEDPA claim is tolled.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11127 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, while you're -- and the State could easily prevent that by setting up some kind of prefiling requirement for --

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11129 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The -- the question of whether it was timely or not is not actually determined until the end of the litigation.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11130 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But -- but you have just said that the -- the court will look on its own to see if there are these exceptions.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11132 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # So that there would be no case of an untimely filing in this period when the court was -- even if you raised no exception, was going through them.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11134 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # There would be no case in which an untimely filing would be included in properly filed because the very fact that the court itself would go through the petition to look for exceptions would take it out of the category.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11135 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor, and exactly the same could be said about Artuz, the procedural bar rules in Artuz, whether someone pled --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11136 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But the -- the difference was that Artuz ranked timely filing as an ingredient of properly filed, and you say but not in Pennsylvania the way it's set up. Timely filing is not an ingredient of properly filed.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11137 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because the State court lets you file it and gives it judicial review and applies it claim by claim.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11138 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But don't -- don't you have a -- a -- sort of a second prong to -- to your response? And I -- I wanted to get into this. You -- you have said Pennsylvania will let you file even though ultimately it, you know, may well determine that you -- you were out of time and you don't fall within any of the exceptions. Well, that's -- that's an answer. I'm not sure it's a strong enough answer to respond to Artuz. But I thought you had a second part to the answer, and I thought your second part to the answer was in that kind of situation, the Third Circuit practice, the Third Circuit rule is that unless we go through the Pennsylvania process, even if we know from day one that we're out of time, we think we have a -- an excuse, but even though we -- we think from day one we're out of time, unless we exhaust the Pennsylvania process, they will throw us out for nonexhaustion. And the reason they will throw us out from nonexhaustion, as opposed to going directly to the question whether there is an excuse for nonexhaustion, is because Pennsylvania will actually let us litigate this --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11139 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11140 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # -- and not determine it as a threshold matter. So -- so your answer, as I understand it, is Pennsylvania let's you litigate it, and the Third Circuit requires you to litigate it so that the only reasonable thing for us to do is to litigate it even if you may say in the abstract it's a purely threshold time question. And for that reason, there should be tolling. Isn't that your argument?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11141 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Your Honor. And it's -- it's connected to the statutory language. AEDPA says we'll toll for properly filed applications. That -- AEDPA is keyed to how much process the State post-conviction courts will give you. In a -- in a State where they say anyone who comes after a year, we won't give you any review and you're just out of court, AEDPA says when -- that's not -- we're not going to consider that properly filed. We won't toll, but --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11142 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # This is putting such a -- I mean, the system is not going to work. It -- it's a rare State system that has an absolute statute of limitation with no exceptions. You're almost going to have to inquire into exceptions. So you're saying this is a way to avoid -- avoid AEDPA endlessly, just keep filing claims that are out of time, and until the court finally gets around to saying it's out of time, your -- your AEDPA time is tolled --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11143 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11144 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- by which time you file another one that's clearly out of time. And until that one is resolved -- I -- this couldn't be what AEDPA was -- was meant to establish.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11145 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And -- and if you're tempted to answer, well, people want to get out so they're not going to sit around forever, then we'd ask you what about the death cases.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11146 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Okay, and that was what I was tempted to answer, and since you said it, I'll go straight to the death cases. In Pennsylvania, certainly there's no -- a death-sentence prisoner can get nowhere by filing what he knows to be an untimely PCRA petition because Pennsylvania law requires the Governor to sign warrants when the conviction is final and then at every break in the litigation basically after that. And the PCRA courts cannot grant a stay of execution until after they find that the petition is both timely and meritorious. So it's not --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11147 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I'm not sure that would apply to other States.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11148 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's true. And I mean, each State can set up a system to -- to satisfy its needs. Pennsylvania could set up a system like the AEDPA successor bar to say you're not going to be filed at all until we give you permission.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11149 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Under your rule that filing is sufficient, are there any instances of -- of frivolous petition where your rule would not apply?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11150 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think all the courts of appeal that have -- have talked about that have thought -- have said that you really shouldn't start figuring out whether it was a frivolous assertion or meritorious --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11151 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, then Justice Scalia's prediction is -- is right. You just keep filing and filing.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11152 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Presumably you could and if there's someone who wants to do that, which is going to be a rare --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11153 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Suppose you lost on that one. Suppose that you wanted some kind of a -- suppose that the majority wanted a standard that would prevent absolutely frivolous filings on the basis of -- of statute of limitations. Would you -- what standard would -- what -- what's our choice of standards there? Could we -- one, obviously, that the prisoner has to be in good faith. Another could be he has to be in good faith and there has to be a reasonable argument that it hasn't run. Maybe there are others that you've thought of.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11154 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that going down that path is going to open up just a nightmare of -- of litigation in Federal court about -- if you start talking about good faith and are you -- if the State courts deny it, can you still say it was nonfrivolous? I think all the courts just across the board have tried to avoid that type of thing.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11155 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Try -- try this simple rule. Where you're dealing with a statute of limitations that has exceptions, it's not properly filed if you do not assert the existence of one of those exceptions.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11156 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Two -- I have two things to say about that. One is it creates a problem with Artuz because that type of rule -- assuming the exceptions are like the PCRA exceptions which go claim by claim, that's a claim-by-claim rule which would then create the anomaly that Artuz shied away from, that you look to whether it was a properly filed application, not to whether it was an application with properly filed claims. The second point is that -- is that for Mr. Pace, whatever the merits of that rule may be going forward, it -- it can't be used against Mr. Pace because there was no such requirement in Pennsylvania. I mean, presumably the -- I assume the Federal courts are not going to make up this rule, that it's going to be up to the State courts to say what their filing --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11157 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Why -- why not? We make up a lot of stuff. (Laughter.)
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11158 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, Artuz talks about you look to the State's procedural filing requirements. This is a Federal statute and properly filed is given a Federal meaning, but you presumably look to the State filing requirements, as you did in Artuz, to determine what that means. Now, all of these concerns about delay and so on are the exact same concerns, where there in Artuz someone could file successive petition after successive petition in New York if they want to delay. It's just not -- it's not a -- it's certainly not a problem for noncapital cases.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11159 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I thought the whole purpose of AEDPA was -- was to prevent delay. I mean, that's -- that's what's -- it seems to me counter-intuitive about the position you're -- you're urging upon us. Here is a statute that was meant to stop these things from dragging on endlessly.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11161 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And you tell us don't worry about these things dragging on endlessly.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11162 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I'm not -- I'm saying AEDPA says come to Federal court within a year. We'll toll when you're in State court if it's properly filed. Properly filed, if the States let you file a lot of stuff, we're going to -- comity requires to allow that, and we'll toll. If the States don't --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11163 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # That's unrealistic if the States allow you to file a lot of stuff. You're -- you're saying the only way the States can stop this thing from going on and on and on is to adopt an absolute rigid statute of limitations, no exceptions.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11164 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's one way or a prefiling requirement.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11165 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Give me another way.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11166 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The AEDPA prefiling requirement where you go to the court and you say, I'd like to file this petition, tell me if I can, and the court says, 30 days later, yes or no. That's --

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11170 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # No, Your Honor. I think the courts are -- are -- the Federal courts are capable of telling the difference between an application for State post-conviction relief on the one hand and a motion for leave to file an application on the other hand. In fact, the Seventh Circuit in -- in the Smith v. Walls case and the Tinker v. Ward case that we cited in our brief had exactly that distinction between an Indiana rule which had a prefiling requirement and an Illinois rule --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11171 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # What about a -- a rule requiring good faith or reasonable argument in death cases? In all the other cases, there's no incentive to do this endless filing, and in death cases, there is. So in those death cases, we would insist that it is not properly filed if it's out of time unless the prisoner in good faith and with a plausible argument, a reasonable argument thought it was in time.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11172 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I suppose that -- I mean, that could be a construction of the statute as long as you let people -- people are going to come to Federal court first and get -- for stay abeyance if you do that. If you don't know until the outcome years later whether you were tolling or not, that's going to cause everyone to file protective filings.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11173 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Do you think that's a reasonable interpretation of properly filed and -- and what I proposed to you is not a reasonable interpretation of properly filed?

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11177 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- simply showing on its face that there's either an absolute statute or that one of the exceptions to the statute exists?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11178 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The problem with that in terms -- is that it conflicts with Artuz' idea that the -- any rule that's a condition to filing has to go to the application as a whole.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11179 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, I don't think it actually -- I mean, in -- I think they're about equal, aren't they, in respect to language? And the argument against the other one is that prisoners are going to get mixed up about it. They -- they don't know exactly what they're supposed to put. The argument against the one I proposed is it adds complexity of decision-making. Sort of between the two, it's rather hard to see.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11180 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Just --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11181 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # They each have their problems.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11182 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Just in terms of -- of policy, I think any rule you adopt that's not mechanical and doesn't let people know on the front end whether they're tolling or not, there's going to be floods of protective filings. Now, the -- the rule like -- a rule which is -- which -- where they know going in and whether they're going to be tolled or not, then they can say plead -- litigate in State court becoming -- before coming to Federal court. And Duncan v. Walker was very clear that the court doesn't want lots of people filing prematurely. If I could, I'd like to turn to equitable tolling. As Chief District Judge Giles found, that it would be an extraordinary deprivation of rights and patently unfair to deny tolling in Federal review here, he found -- Judge Giles found that if Mr. Pace had filed a Federal habeas petition instead of his PCRA petition, Judge Giles would have dismissed it and required him to do exactly what he did, which is to seek State remedies under the PCRA. As Judge Giles found, Mr. Pace acted diligently and appropriately under the circumstances. It seems this is a clear case for equitable tolling. This is a case where --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11183 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # The circumstances included the fact that he sat on this thing for 3 years. He could have brought it 3 years earlier, couldn't he?

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11187 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # So -- when -- when you -- when you fold that into the circumstances, it doesn't seem to me an overwhelming case for equitable tolling.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11188 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I have, I think, four responses to that. First, Mr. Pace was not sitting on his hands for these 4 years. This is a man who entered prison at age 17, barely educated, barely literate, drug-addled. This is not someone who was prepared to litigate on his own when he came into prison. This is someone who -- whose legal papers were destroyed by the prison. This is someone who was without counsel for that entire time that you're talking about. This is someone who had very limited access to a law library throughout that time. Mr. Pace spent those years teaching himself how to do law which he --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11189 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # -- take a whole lot to figure out that you have a claim where your lawyer told you -- you weren't going up for life and it turned out you were sent up for life.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11190 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # In fact --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11191 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I mean, what does it take if -- can a 17-year-old figure that something has gone wrong here?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11192 # TRUE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, in fact, that -- that claim was litigated -- litigated in the first petition, and in fact, he didn't think of that. If you look at his pro se PCHA petition, he didn't know that was a claim. It's a -- it's a form that he filled out and handed in and appointed counsel came up with that claim in the first post-conviction proceeding. This is much more complex than that. If you look at his briefs, which are in the joint appendix, Pennsylvania had a very complex system of law here where they had statutory bar rules but they had judicial exceptions to those rules. And it's not an easy matter for someone to figure that out. Mr. Pace educated himself. Just compare the pro se pleading filed in 1992 to what he filed in 1996, and you can see what he did during these 4 years. The other -- the other -- just -- my light is on, but just the other things I'd like to mention about that are that keep in mind, during this time there were no time limits on filing in either State or Federal court. The commonwealth has never alleged any prejudice from this time, and there's never been any allegation that Mr. Pace acted in bad faith and with any -- any intent to delay. In fact, this is someone who wanted to get his claims heard, wanted to figure out how to do it right, and did figure out how to do it right in the end. I would like to reserve the rest of my time.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11197 # FALSE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address the structure of the Pennsylvania filing deadlines for post-conviction review because I think they shed some light and need some discussion here. What Pennsylvania did was to establish a 1-year, flat time limit that applies to everybody. 1 year from conviction. It's automatic. It doesn't matter what the nature of your claims are. It doesn't matter when you discovered your claim. In order to comply with that time limit, all you have to do is file a post-conviction petition within 1 year of finality. The rest of the statute is essentially a separate set of filing deadlines for petitioners, for successive petitioners, for people who either have already had one round of post-conviction review or who haven't bothered to pursue it. Those people, said the legislature, are only going to be entitled to further post-conviction review, to additional rounds of post-conviction review if they fall into a particular class of claim that couldn't have been raised earlier. And -- and the legislature identified three classes that mirror the three provisions in the Federal statute of limitations. And if the petitioner falls within any of those classes, he then has 60 days from the time that that claim arose in order to come into court. Now, if a petitioner files a post-conviction petition and he's within a year of finality, those so-called exceptions don't come into play. They don't apply. He doesn't need to meet them. Those are for the second petitioner. So what Pennsylvania really has is a two-level system of statutes of -- of filing limitations. And of course, in order for the court to determine whether the petitioner has met the filing deadline, he has to look at these three classes for someone who has passed 1 year from finality. That's not an exception in the way I think that the petitioner and some of the lower courts have used the term at all. These are simply different kinds of filing limits. And of course, the court has to look at the statute and the nature of the claims to see whether review is available and to see whether the petitioner has sought review within the proper time. Nothing about that system makes those so-called exceptions not time limits. They're still time limits, and if you don't file in time and come within one of those classes, then the second petition, successive petition time limits don't apply to you and you're out of time.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11203 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's right.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11204 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # It -- it's my -- I still have a feeling that this is a limited universe. Now, my reason for thinking that is that the Federal statute says you have to file within a year of -- and then it lists four dates. And the middle two are special new cases, unusual probably. The first one and the fourth one are the important ones. The first one is final in the State courts, your first round, and the fourth one is newly discovered evidence. Now, my guess is most States also allow you for collateral -- to file collateral relief in those two circumstances. And in most States probably you get nearly a year from the same kind of event. So if you go after the year, you're out of luck in Federal court. If you're within the year, you're probably okay for the State. But there are a few States that have -- maybe Pennsylvania -- just 60 days from one of the events, newly discovered evidence, but a year for the Federal. So we're talking about people who file between 2 and 12 months. That -- that must be a pretty limited class.

For people who aren't satisfied with the round of direct appeal and a round of first -- of post-conviction review in State court. And so the question is whether the Federal statute should be interpreted in a way that essentially writes off the State's time requirements for the successive petitioner so that we can make sure that the successive petitioner can exhaust whatever new claims he wants to come up with in State court before he comes to Federal Circuit.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11212 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The -- the general rule -- and this is implicit I think in the fact that Congress passed a statute of limitations. The general rule is that the petitioner is entitled to whatever he automatically gets in State court in order to exhaust a universe of claims, not all possible claims, but whatever claims can be exhausted within those guaranteed rounds of review. At that point, he should go to Federal court. If new claims arise after that, then Congress specifically provided for them in the second and successive petition procedure that it has in the Federal statute. The way that would interact --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11213 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # But no -- there's still an exhaustion requirement.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11214 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The way that would interact with -- for exhaustion purposes with a State like Pennsylvania is this. The petitioner finishes his direct review. He finishes his post-conviction review. He has a set of clearly exhausted claims. He files a fully exhausted petition in Federal court. No Rose v. Lundy problem. If a new claim arises at that point, then he has to go to State court and try to exhaust that claim in State court. He can do that while a Federal petition is pending or even after a first Federal petition has already been disposed of. In fact, he may have to because the claim may not arise before the end of litigation in Federal court. When he gets to State court, he's either going to be deemed timely or not. Actually the fact that we have a 60-day time limit as opposed to a whole year helps him because it helps make it clear to him that he's got to come to State court at a point where he's really got a long time left to deal with Federal court because he's going to --

Isn't the wrinkle that even in cases in which you and I might say patently he's going to be out of time if he goes back to Federal court, the Third Circuit is requiring him to go there anyway, go through the formality of formal exhaustion, if you will, before they'll consider it? And isn't that a basis at least for equitable tolling?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11216 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # With respect to your argument, the answer is absolutely not. First of all, as you have just observed, that's really an argument that goes to equitable tolling. Even petitioner doesn't bring in the Third Circuit law with respect to statutory tolling,
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11217 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Right.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11218 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # with respect to understanding the -- the language of the statute. As to equitable tolling, however, the factual premise is wrong. It's not true that the Third Circuit forces the defendant to go back to State court no matter what. In fact --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11219 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Okay. Help me -- help me out here because I -- I just don't remember well enough. I thought that's what Judge Giles was getting at when he said, you know, he would have been thrown if he hadn't gone through the State procedure. So help me out. Is that what he was getting at or not?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11220 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That is what he was getting at but at a limited point in time, and the whole question for equitable tolling purposes was at what point in time. Nobody argues that the Third Circuit still is making everybody go back and do it no matter what. What the petitioner argued was that the Third Circuit case law, as of 1997 when he was first starting his second round of post-conviction review in State court, as of that time, he says, the Third Circuit case law said you have to go back no matter what even though Pennsylvania has a -- this new statute of limitations. That's not what the Third Circuit says, though. And all the cases that the petitioner relies on primarily -- he cites a -- a case called Doctor, a case called Banks, a case called Lambert. All of those cases were decided before the Pennsylvania courts began applying the new jurisdictional time bar in State court.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11221 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # If that means the petitioner was wrong, doesn't it also mean that Judge Giles is wrong, and if Judge Giles can't figure it out, isn't there a pretty good argument that the petitioner ought to get equitable tolling?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11222 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, there are a number of problems with the equitable tolling, Your Honor. But even taking that main one, that the petitioner made a mistake of law, that he didn't figure out correctly whether he was supposed to go back to State court, even on that point, Your Honor, that's not grounds for equitable tolling. You take a risk when you make a legal argument that it will fail. This legal argument was controlled entirely by State law, and what the Third Circuit, as opposed to Judge Giles who was reversed by the Third Circuit said, is that you have to look back to State law. What the Third Circuit has said -- and the -- one of the cases cited in our brief at page 49 is Walker v. Frank. Chief Judge Becker said no, we're not going to give equitable tolling to these defendants because at the very latest -- at the very latest -- they had to know by December of 1997 that they were going to be time-barred in State court. This petitioner filed --

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11224 # TRUE # MR.

He said at this early time it was still unclear whether it would be applied.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11225 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # So far as this case is concerned, yes. And -- and so if Judge Giles got it wrong, isn't there a pretty good argument for equitable tolling when the petitioner gets it wrong?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11226 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # What there is is an argument that he had an argument to make in Federal court that he was not -- that he was still going to have the opportunity to go back to State court.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11227 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But -- but this argument is not trying to decide for the States. This argument basically is if nobody can figure it out, including a Federal district judge, at least give me the benefit of the doubt with equitable tolling.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11228 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's not true that nobody could figure it out, Your Honor. In fact, all the cases that the petitioner cites in his brief from Federal district court judges who were sending defendants back to State court during this period because they said, well, maybe you'll get exhaustion anyway, maybe you'll be able to exhaust claims, of those cases that are cited in the brief, most of them are from the same one judge who kept saying the same thing over and over. Several of the other cases didn't even talk about the State time bar, and at that same period of time, there were other district judges who weren't sending defendants back, who were saying there's a new State time bar, you're barred in State court, and therefore, if you want to raise this claim in Federal court, you can, but you face procedural default.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11236 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The point is, Your Honor, that that's not the test for equitable tolling. There are all sorts of arguments that a defendant can make about why the law is unclear. It wouldn't have had to depend on the Federal court's understanding of this particular State law. A defendant could come along and he could say, well, I'm unclear about the application of (d)(2). I've got circuits like the Ninth Circuit who tell me that even if my petition is blatantly untimely in State court, it still tolls. I filed, knowing I was untimely in State court, because the Ninth Circuit tells me that I'm still going to get tolling, and now you tell me I'm not going to get tolling?

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11239 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I -- I have a general question which is not Pennsylvania. I've looked up or got a rough idea of the statute of limitations for a first petition in many States, and most of them are a year or more. So there's no problem. But 11 have less than a year, and in particular, Oklahoma has 3 months apparently. And Oklahoma is -- a lot of death cases come out of Oklahoma. So what rule would -- where I have to have -- I focus on Oklahoma for the reason that I think this has bite only in death cases because I don't see why anybody would want to abuse the system except in a death case. But there are a lot there. Now, am I supposed to say in Oklahoma which has the 90 days but exceptions, that where somebody has filed a petition in State court, let's say, on the 180th day, and he thinks an exception applies, is he supposed to also run to Federal court and file a protective petition which could well have been dismissed on exhaustion grounds? What's he supposed to do and how is he supposed to know what to do? And one system that might work is Justice Scalia's idea.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11240 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, it's --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11241 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Another that might work is -- is requiring in death cases that it be a -- a plausible ground or something like that. I want to know your opinion of how to deal with that circumstance.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11242 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It certainly shouldn't be a plausible ground test, and even the petitioner agrees with that position, Your Honor. And it certainly would work if we adopted, as I think Congress did, a system like the one that Justice Scalia spelled out because then the defendant knows. And I'd like to get back, as I was discussing with Justice Kennedy, to what the defendant knows. He knows that if he's outside the time that he's guaranteed automatic review, whether direct appeal or State review, State post-conviction review, that his chances of exhausting more claims in State court --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11243 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Actually most prisoners are not represented, I don't think, at this stage. They -- they haven't a clue about the word exhaustion, and they haven't a clue about the statute of limitations. So they file a -- a paper in -- in the State court, and they say this roughly is what my problem is. Is that what happens, or are they all quite educated?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11244 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, the -- the Congress that passed this statute of limitations is the same Congress that made the decision about whether habeas petitioners would be appointed counsel or not. So to say that we can't really apply the statute of limitations because it would be unfair as to those petitioners who are unrepresented would be essentially to undercut the statute of limitations --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11245 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I'm trying to get from you what is your opinion of a practical approach to this problem in Oklahoma, say.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11246 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The practical approach to the problem is to look at the statute that says you have a year. If you file your petition within that year, whatever you've got at the end of that year, you can take to Federal court and be confident that it's exhausted. If you want to do something after that year, you can't be confident anymore. All you have to do is -- is count a year. Now, if something comes up after that time, you're supposed to go to State court first, even if you've got something in Federal court. This statute of limitations isn't supposed to be interpreted in order to make the Federal successive petitions standard moot and unnecessary. It exists for a reason. So if a -- if a claim arises at a later point, after you have finished your guaranteed review in State court, go back to State court, whether or not you've got something pending in Federal court. Don't put that new claim in with your old claims in Federal court because then you have a mixed petition. If you get exhaustion in State court, whether you're timely or untimely, you're going to exhaust. You can then go back to Federal court with a request for a successive petition. It -- that's what you have to do and that's appropriate because that's how Congress set up the statute, with the 1-year filing deadline and -- and a provision for successive petitions.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11247 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # May I ask how you would handle a case that is a successive petition, a late -- a recently found claim, and the -- filed beyond the statute of limitations but the State has three exceptions to the statute, but it does not require that the -- the petitioner identify the exception in the petition? It just allows it for the judge to decide. Would there be tolling during the period in which the judge decided whether or not the petition was timely in your view?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11248 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor, because all the court is doing is deciding whether the time bar applies, and in order -- in a State that has those kind of categories, what the court is, in effect, doing is deciding what kind of time limit applies to this particular petition.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11249 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And even if it takes a year or so to make that decision, you'd say no tolling.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11250 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, that's really true of every kind of statute of limitations issue that can come up. Take away those three exceptions. Just have the 1-year flat time bar. Does that mean that the State court isn't going to have to take some time to look at it and decide? What if there's a prisoner mailbox question? What if there's an amendment question of the type that this Court just granted cert on last month in Mayle v. Felix? What if there's a question about how to compute --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11251 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And in all of those questions, you'd say there would be no tolling in order to find out whether it was timely or not.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11252 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's right because during that time, the State court is deciding on timeliness, and if it's untimely, it was untimely as of the point of filing. That's what makes it a filing requirement. You take your claim and you file it --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11253 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But what about the reasoning in Artuz that the application was -- if it turns out later it was timely, it would have been properly filed?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11254 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I'm sorry. I -- I think I understand Artuz to have said that if the application was untimely, then it was not properly filed and it was not properly filed from the get-go, Your Honor. The question that was reserved in Artuz is whether something about exceptions changes that statement in Artuz. And my response is that certainly nothing about the kind of exceptions that were present in this case changed the response.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11255 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No, but if I understand you correctly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6 months to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up with the conclusion that it was not timely, there would be no tolling for that 6-month period.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11256 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's correct, Your Honor. Now, in Pennsylvania, of course, all you have to do to be timely is file within the 1 year. And whatever you've exhausted is done. That -- I'd like to go from that into expanding more on the equitable tolling because I think that that plays in here. This defendant had two rounds. The first round was 4 years, not even just 3, but I believe closer to 4 years before there was a filing deadline in either State court or Federal court. Now, when you decide to wait -- he didn't have a filing deadline, but when you decide to wait, you take your chances. There's a rule that's even more immutable than time limits or jurisdiction, and it is that things change. When you wait, you take the risk that your evidence may change, the facts may change, the law may change. That's what happened to this defendant while he sat and did nothing. He says he was learning the law during that period. Well, then would it -- is it just 4 years? What if it had taken him 8 years or 12 years to learn the law? He had the filing deadline that came up. He never claimed that he didn't understand what it was. He could have beaten any of those filing deadlines in State or Federal court. He says, I have no incentive for delay. I'm not a capital defendant. All I wanted was a speedy resolution of my claims. But in that case, he didn't need a filing deadline to make himself come to court. The fact is that there are thousands of cases in which noncapital defendants file these kinds of late petitions, and the State courts are trying to deal with them. And this is the way that Pennsylvania chose to try to deal with the problem in State court, in its State courts, not just for capital cases, but for noncapital cases.
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11257 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Why -- why are there thousands of cases in which noncapital defendants file this type of case? What -- what incentives do noncapital defendants have to drag it on?
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11258 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The incentive that they have to drag it on is that they may come up with a new legal theory that attracts a -- a court that they didn't present before, that new facts may come up, may arise that they try to argue. That's what this defendant did, although they weren't really new. They were facts that were available to him as of the -- the day of his guilty plea in 1986. He claimed that they were new. And if there's no cost to doing that, if in fact there may be a benefit to doing that, then why not? If --

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11262 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # It's certainly something that any prosecutor would tell you, Your Honor. This -- this crime occurred 20 years ago in 1985. And this was a relatively simple case. A police officer came on to the scene while the defendant was bashing the head of the victim with a nightstick. But even in a simple case, you're going to have problems of proof, and the party with the primary problems of proof is the party with the burden of proof, and that's the prosecution. So, of course, there's going to be a problem for the prosecution, and that's why we adopt -- one of the reasons that we adopt this kind time limit. Even once the petitioner did come back to State court, though, Your Honor -- and this gets back to the questions that Justice O'Connor was raising initially -- he raised essentially the same claims. He says, well, this time around, I put them in a different guise, different facts in support of my claim about my guilty plea, different legal labels. Yes, but all in the context of -- of ineffective assistance because the only way he could get into court a second time for a second round of post-conviction review in Pennsylvania was to say that my lawyer at my first round of State post-conviction review was ineffective. He didn't attach these affidavits from my mother and father. He didn't call it due process instead of whatever else he called it. Now, petitioner could make those --
argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11263 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, he also raised an -- an entirely different claim, didn't he?

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11264 # TRUE # MR.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11270 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # But the only way that the petitioner could exhaust that claim in State court on a second round of post-conviction review would be to put it in terms of ineffective assistance of first post-conviction counsel. And, of course, he can't then take that claim and come to Federal court because claims of the ineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel are not cognizable on Federal habeas review. So not only did he wait 4 years when he had no filing deadline impediments to come to court, but he then raised in State court claims that he couldn't have turned into exhausted Federal claims anyway in order to add to what was available to him, to the universe of claims that were available to him after his initial round of State post-conviction review. And we're talking about equitable tolling for somebody who only has a problem because of his own inaction for 4 years and who even then spent another 3 years in State court on claims that he couldn't bring to State court, and even then, in the face of developing State law about the time bar, refused to look at it. So not only did we have a statute that says you're in trouble, you're time-barred now --

That claim was litigated on the first round of post-conviction review and the State courts rejected it because of the transcript of the colloquy. The defendant could have taken that claim to Federal court in 1992. He just didn't. Now --

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11280 # TRUE # MR. EISENBERG # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # He -- he knew it appeared in the transcript. That was the basis of his claim in -- on State post-conviction review. He had not one but two lawyers appointed for that review and he litigated it on up through the State highest court. But even when he came back in 1996, he knew the statute was there. He's never claimed he was confused by the new time bar. He says, I thought I would get some exceptions to it. But then the State court came and said, no, it's jurisdictional, no exceptions. Defendant didn't do anything. It was 1997, still 2 years before he filed in Federal court. Didn't take note of that State -- he took note of it. He acknowledges in his pleadings that he knew about it, but he decided not to go to Federal court anyway. More -- more cases come out from the State courts, even the decision in his own court -- in his own case from the State's highest court. Even when we get to July of 1999 and the State supreme court denies review on the timeliness question in his own case, the petitioner says, even then how was I supposed to know that I wasn't going to get some kind of exception to the State time bar? I didn't know that until the next month when another case came out from the State supreme court. This was the third or the fourth from the State supreme court in somebody else's case. Only then in August of 1999 did I finally know that I was time-barred, meaning I knew then that I had never been getting any tolling, that for the last 3 years, I didn't have 1 day of tolling on my Federal claims. And at that point did he then go to Federal court? Even then he didn't. Even in August 1999 when the petitioner says, finally I know that I've been out of luck for the last 3 years, that I'm 3 years late to Federal court, does he rush in then? No. He waits another 5 months after August of 1999 to finally come to Federal court and say here's my petition, here's the claims that I've been working on and that I have litigated in State court. That's not equitable tolling, Your Honor. It's not equitable tolling under the circumstances of the specific circumstances of this case, and it's not equitable tolling in general when a petitioner claims essentially I have a mistake of law, I thought that I would win, I knew there were arguments against me, I knew I might lose those arguments, but I really thought I could win, and therefore you should give me equitable tolling while I pursue them.

argument in Pace against the -- the warden # 03-9627 # 11285 # FALSE # MR. WYCOFF # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Several things. First of all, the respondent said that in the second petition Mr. Pace only presented State law, ineffective assistance of post-conviction claims, which are not Federal claims. That's absolutely not true. He presented the ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as a waiver-overcoming mechanism not as a substantive claim for relief. The substantive claims were due process claim, ineffective assistance of counsel, and new facts which needed to be exhausted under Third Circuit exhaustion law. Second, respondent suggested and -- and the Third Circuit also suggested that State law somehow became clear in mid-December 1997 when the Superior Court, which is Pennsylvania's intermediate court, decided a case called Alcorn. Alcorn was the first case to apply the time bar. But the Third Circuit itself, after Alcorn in the Lambert case, held that the -- the statutory language of the time bar is not dispositive and you have to exhaust even if you don't meet one of the statutory exceptions because the court may fashion judicial exceptions just like they did for all the other procedural bar rules. In fact, Pennsylvania in the Lambert case, in their opposition to the certiorari petition in May of 1998, said that that's a correct statement of Pennsylvania law, that there are judicially created exceptions, including the miscarriage of justice exception which will probably apply to the time bar, just like they applied to the other statutory bars. So Alcorn did not, even if it could have, since it's an intermediate court, it did not clear up the state of the law. The law did not become clear as to the specific things that Mr. Pace alleged, which is the miscarriage of justice exception under Pennsylvania law and the illegal sentence exception, judicially created exceptions to bar, were not rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court until July of -- I'm sorry -- August of 1999, which is -- by that time Mr. Pace was already out of State court so those -- the law became clear in State court after he was already done litigating. The Third Circuit did not actually find the statutory language of the PCRA time bar dispositive of the exhaustion question until March of 2000. The district courts, not just Judge Giles, Chief Judge Giles' 20 years experience on the bench, not just him, lots of district courts send people back to exhaust during this same time period. State law was unclear. State law appeared to provide remedies and possible merits review. Because the State law was unclear, Third Circuit exhaustion law required petitioners like Mr. Pace to go back and exhaust. And he did exactly what the circuit law required of him. And as a matter of equity, the court cannot punish someone. A Federal court can't say, do X, and then after that person does it, say, sorry, you're out of court. It's not fair and it shouldn't happen here. As to statutory tolling, I just want to -- the -- the Court I think can just easily decide this case just by reaffirming the central holding of Artuz which is when a State court allows you to file, gives your filing judicial review, applies a bar rule on a claim-by-claim basis, that was a condition to obtaining relief on claims in the petition. It's not a condition to filing the petition itself. And if the State court eventually holds all your claims are barred, as they did in Artuz, the petition is, nevertheless, properly filed and should toll AEDPA's statutory -- under AEDPA's statutory tolling provisions. If there are no further questions.

New York, this Court explained that there are exceptional cases in which the totality of evidence surrounding jury selection is so strong that a finding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to be accepted by this Court. This is that exceptional case, a case in which even on collateral review, the sheer weight of the mutually reinforcing evidence renders objectively unreasonable the State court's conclusion that race did not motivate even one of the prosecution's peremptory strikes.

You have to find, Justice O'Connor, that race was the but-for factor or the tipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for factor for at least one to come within the four corners of Batson. Now, I could argue I think, if I needed to in this case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is an unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially excluding jurors from the venire, comes within Batson, the Batson proscription itself, or I could argue that case too.

There is -- there's some -- now some reasonably substantial Law Review commentary in the State of Texas. I cited the Court to -- to one in the Houston Law Review or the Houston Bar Review when I was here last time, and there has since been one in the St. Mary's Law Review that says this is a procedure that is used to discriminate on the basis of visual preference. And what's particularly interesting about it in this case is there was a contemporaneous objection in week 2 and week 3 and week 4 that the State was doing this based on race, and the State offered no defense at the time. It offered no defense in the subsequent Batson hearing. It had no explanation before the magistrate, the district judge, the Fifth Circuit, in this Court or below, and now in this Court this time it says, well, there's this other case in which the reason given was that we didn't want to embarrass the probation officer and we didn't -- and we had people who had ties in the front row. There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would justify those excuses here. And the evidence in the -- the only evidence in the record that seems to me compels the conclusion that this was done for the deliberate purpose of minimizing the number of African Americans on the jury. And it was done by prosecutors, each of whom -- there were two prosecutors in this case, each of whom was found to have violated Batson in criminal -- other criminal trials contemporaneous with this one.

The defense shuffled -- the defense then shuffled and they tried to come in and back -- back and shuffle again when a number of African Americans were advanced in the order. There -- under this Court's Batson jurisprudence, the proscription against using peremptory strikes for a racial purpose or a gender-based purpose is proscribed to the defense, as well as the prosecution, but there -- the one doesn't excuse the other, and there has never been a claim, nor is there a factual predicate laid in this case for a claim, that Mr. Miller-El's trial lawyers were doing the same.

Now, we haven't made that freestanding claim because I don't think we need that freestanding claim. The jury shuffle is a practice that exists only in the State of Texas and, to my understanding, has ever existed only in the State of Texas. So it's a -- it's a very peculiar phenomenon, but I think I could make the argument that, look, even if there weren't any of these six -- let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no African Americans came up. There simply were no African Americans out of the 108 who were questioned. It seems to me that that in and of itself would violate at least a generous reading of Batson.

But in any event, you -- yes. You have to go through all of the evidence in the case, and what the evidence in the case shows is that, first of all, as this Court observed the last time it was here, the State's proper race-neutral rationales for striking African American jurors pertains just as well to white jurors who were not challenged and who did serve. It's -- you also have to look at the race-coding of the cards, race-coding that was done by prosecutors whom this Court observed last time were trained in an office culture suffused with bias against African Americans in jury selection.

argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11340 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # The respondent's reply to this -- this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the -- the two white prospective jurors who had -- who had expressed antagonism towards the death penalty were subjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out of eight black prospective jurors were seven who had expressed antagonism to the death penalty. Now, is that not true?
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11341 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think that if I -- I believe that with respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the graphic script, what the State is saying is last time we said there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed hesitation. And this Court observed that, well, yes, but only two of the whites got it. Now, they filed a brief that says, well, the other eight were all either struck for cause or by consent. Now, that's -- that fails for at least two reasons. One, they identified 10. In this Court and below, we identified 19 jurors who absolutely expressed hesitation about the death penalty, and they have still not accounted for them. Number one. Number two, with respect to the eight who they have accounted for in their brief, the fact that at the very end of voir dire, they were struck for cause, or there was an agreement at the end of voir dire to remove them hardly provides a reason not to give the minimum punishment ploy to jurors who fit the categorization that the State has described.

WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Scalia, in the context of all of this other evidence, which is the context in which you need to weigh it and determine whether we have satisfied the stringent standard for review that applies, I respectfully submit that if you go through the -- the voir dire questioning of Mr. Fields and Mr. Warren and Mr. Rand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it, even leaving aside all of the other evidence, contemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the jury selection in this case, I think you will have to come to the conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these cases. In Mr. Fields -- we've -- we've mentioned him in our -- we've described him at length in our brief. This is a man whom -- I mean, forget the -- the State on its questionnaire at the time, on page 14 of the joint lodging, wrote, quote, no reservations against the death penalty. Mr. Rand, who we've compared and -- and your concurring opinion, Justice Scalia, the last time it was here said, well, yes, Rand and Mazza are very close, but it's a high burden you have to -- you have to overcome here. It's a burden we can overcome here not only because of all of this other evidence, but because of what the State wrote on the questionnaire when Mr. Rand was being examined, page 30 of the joint lodging. This is the State's notes, Quote: "could be enforced depending on the circumstances -- Murder/robbery, type of offense -- Think proper for death penalty -- Yes, I can serve." This is a -- this is a venireman who said that if he were Governor, he would set the minimum punishment for murder at 99 years. Mr. Fields was --

The problem with the State's approach to this case -- and it was the problem that -- of the Fifth Circuit's analysis -- is it is pointillistic. It is an analysis. It's like walking up close to a Seurat painting and looking at each dot and saying, well, it's red, but that might not necessarily be the handbag. Yes, you have -- I mean, he had to paint with the dots, but as a reviewing court, you need to step back and look at this and ask yourself, with respect to, for example, Mr. Fields, who said not only would he have no hesitation about putting the death penalty in place, but he actually testified that he thought that in capital cases, the State was God's embodiment on earth.

If there is a plausible explanation for disparate questioning, which there is not in the statistics in this case, I wouldn't be arguing that that in and of itself, leaving aside individual, you know, side-by-side juror comparisons, would suffice. But here, we have, in addition to the disparate questioning that is not susceptible to a race-neutral explanation -- we have things like the prosecutor's own notations in the -- in the questionnaires.

So that shows he -- he wasn't like others who didn't entertain those doubts about rehabilitation.
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11366 # TRUE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg. He -- he expressed an opinion that he thought that people could be rehabilitated, not as strong as those opinions by juror -- white Juror Hearn and white Juror Duke who sat. But in Fields' case, he was absolutely unequivocal -- I'm -- I'm referring the Court to page 185 of the joint appendix -- absolutely unequivocal that the ability or propensity for rehabilitation would not affect his willingness to -- to put in the death penalty. I believe in the dissenting and concurring opinions in this case last time with respect to Mr. Fields, it was pointed out that he was a supporter of the death penalty who could put in the death penalty. And what's interesting about Fields is if you look at the transcript pages where the prosecutor justifies the strike, on page 197 of the joint appendix, the prosecutor says, well, he was -- he -- he -- I -- he -- he said something about rehabilitation, and it goes on. And then two pages later -- they have a discussion about something -- a discussion about which questionnaires will or won't go into evidence. Two pages later, Mr. Nelson comes in and says, oh, yes, and he also had a brother who had had some involvement with law enforcement. Well, to say that that's an afterthought is really saying something. He wasn't questioned about it, as -- as neither were -- by the State, as neither were any of the four white jurors who sat who had family members who had been arrested or prosecuted.

And the interesting thing about these is it's not just race and gender, it's were they fat, did they have a beard, did they have a mustache.

argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11381 # FALSE # MS. BUNN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The big picture. The majority of African Americans summoned for jury duty in this case were either opposed to the death penalty generally or unwilling to impose it, while the majority of white jurors had no qualms about the death penalty. Striking prospective jurors based on their case-related views which, after the fact, correlate with race is not unconstitutional. Essentially, though Miller-El has presented this case as one of disparate treatment, it is actually one of disparate impact. I will discuss first --
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11382 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Would -- would the statement that you gave -- let's assume there was a -- a working premise that blacks were more -- were less inclined to impose the death penalty. Would that alone justify more intensive questioning of every black juror?
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11383 # TRUE # MS. BUNN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Your Honor, it would not. And the record in this case actually does not support that that -- does not support a proposition that black jurors were questioned differently. Most significantly, the minimum -- the questioning on the graphic script. Of the six challenged jurors in this case, only two received the graphic -- graphic script at the outset of their voir dire, Carrol Boggess and -- and Wayman Kennedy, both of whom had answered the questions in their juror questionnaire indicating ambiguity regarding their views on the death penalty regarding their support for the death penalty. This fact --
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11384 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Now -- now, as I understand it, this case was here before. We all read this and we went through it, and as a result of that, I -- if I read the opinion -- not the dissent, but the majority opinion -- and it might be in my interest if people followed dissents more, but I think the law is we follow the majority opinion. So when I read the majority opinion, I read, number one, there was history in this county, at least 7 years earlier though, where they actually had a booklet which said let's keep all the African Americans out, here's how you do it. Then you had jury shuffling, which were two instances. In one of them, there are like 40 people. In my mind, you know, we have rows. In row 1 there are four black jurors and six white; row 2, three black and seven white; row 3, two black and in the last row one black, and the prosecution says, hey, let's shuffle it. All right? And the other time he did it, the only other time -- it wasn't quite that bad -- the same idea. Then the third thing that comes up is you find instances here -- not everyone, absolutely right -- but instances where black people who seemed really for the death penalty, say, like Mr. Fields manages to get knocked off, but Mrs. Mazza who seems quite uncertain is kept on. And then we have this disparate questioning that you're about to mention where it just turns out that almost every black is given this really -- you know, bring them in a gurney, put -- put -- you know, real graphic description of the death penalty, and white people who also expressed hesitation aren't. Okay? So on the basis of that, the majority writes there is, indeed, a strong suspicion here that this was discrimination. So I want to ask you -- and if I were to write something like that -- I didn't write the words, but I would mean, well, I think that's what it is unless there's something later on that comes out to the contrary. So I'm asking you what was to the contrary. What came out in this Fifth Circuit that we didn't have in front of us the last time?
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11385 # TRUE # MS. BUNN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, the first time before this Court, the issue was whether, based on a threshold examination of the record --
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11386 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # I know that was the issue, but I'm saying if I read the opinion to say -- now, maybe you'll tell me I shouldn't. We should just go back and redo what we did. But I'm reading the opinion to say, well, unless something changes here, this is bad. It's discriminatory. Now, you can tell me, one, I'm wrong to read the opinion that way. I got that argument. But I want to be sure that that's what's in front of me. So I want to know is there something different in the Fifth Circuit that wasn't here the first time.

BUNN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, I believe the most -- the most important difference in the review of this Court the last time and the review of this -- of the Court this time is that the Court did take a big-picture look at all of the pieces of evidence, but at this point, as the court of appeals did and as this -- as this Court must do now, it must go, as Justice Scalia mentioned, juror by juror, the jurors who were challenged.

I'm asking you -- it's a serious question -- as whether there was something new or different that came up when the Fifth Circuit wrote this. Now, I gathered from your answer, it might be yes, and if the answer is yes, I want you to say what it is because I'm interested.

And a review of Miller-El's purposeful discrimination claim must focus on these six jurors. And given the -- the views expressed by these six veniremen, it is no surprise that prosecutors struck them. Each venire member peremptorily struck by the State had voiced views unfavorable to the State but were not subject to a challenge for cause. These reasons are race-neutral, case-related, and supported by the record, in fact, supported by the very words that the jurors uttered. Carrol Boggess indicated that her beliefs -- on the questionnaire indicated her beliefs would impair -- would impair her ability to impose the death penalty as a juror. She referred to her -- an execution as a murder during her voir dire and other comments evincing hesitance regarding her ability to impose the death penalty.

argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11466 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # The -- I -- I don't think that's his argument at all. He is not arguing that there might not be other bases for making challenges or making peremptory strikes. What he is saying is those challenges exist for lots and lots of jurors. And what in fact there is is very strong circumstantial evidence that what tipped the prosecutors to make the peremptory challenges here -- what he was referring to earlier in this argument as the but-for cause was racial. He's not saying nothing else could have been involved. He was saying race tipped it. And it's the circumstantial evidence, among other things, that indicates that race does. And that's the reason for my question. Is there some reason to believe that there had been a change of heart on the issue of race so that his argument is unsound?

argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11468 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # You think they're based, for example, on capital punishment. But now, let me give you two of them, and this is why -- this is actually why I get somewhat concerned about this. Here is the answer of the white woman who served on the jury about capital punishment. Could you put Miller-El to death? Mrs. Mazza: It's difficult. I've had 2 days to think about it, and given my religious upbringing, et cetera, going on for a few sentences, I think I could. She serves on the jury. Okay? Here's Mr. Fields who is black and whom they got off. What I think, according to the Old Testament, people were killed if they violated His law. In its extended service, the State represents Him. I feel the State is God's extended person. In other words, the State represents God in today's time. Therefore, if the State exacts death, that's what it should be. Okay? That's the man they feel has the qualm, and the woman I told you who was white they feel has no qualm. Now, I look at that, and I say, you know, I mean, my goodness, it's pretty hard to see how you get yourself in that frame of mind.
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11469 # TRUE # MS. BUNN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, the -- that was not the prosecutor's argument at trial and it's -- it is not our position now that --
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11470 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # No. I know. They then said that oh, you see, Mr. Fields was -- is it a woman or a man? I'm not sure. Yes, he's a man I think. He -- he's kept off, the black man, because of his views on rehabilitation. So I looked up what those views were, and that consists of his saying -- my -- my interpretation -- well, I think any person, if he really believes in God, really believes in God, could be rehabilitated. At which point the prosecutor says to him, well, suppose you came to the conclusion that Miller-El really was touched by God, could you put him to death? Answer: Yes. Why? Because, well, it seems to me my job here is to follow the law. That's the man whom they think they are -- they are kicking off because of his views of possibly not applying the death penalty, and the other woman, who is white, they keep on. Now, I think that's the whole story there. There was also the brother who was a drug -- who was the drug -- you know, he had had drug convictions, but that's scarcely mentioned. So -- so I look at those two people and I think, gee, put that in context. My goodness. What -- what's your response to that?
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11471 # TRUE # MS. BUNN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Your Honor, as to Juror Billy Jean Fields, he did not express qualms about the death penalty in general, but he did state that it was his belief that no one -- no one -- no matter their background or what they've done, is beyond rehabilitation. Everyone can be rehabilitated. And this was a view regarding rehabilitation that no one, white or black, had expressed. It was a unique view, and in this case where jurors are asked to -- to -- the question, is this person going to be a continuing threat to society, is -- is something that's going to go into their punishment inquiry. And if this person is one who the prosecutor believed could tend -- if there's a repentant criminal defendant on the stand who testifies, that they would tend to believe that person and answer the question no. And -- and again, this was not the only basis for the State's strike as well. The fact that his brother had been prosecuted in Dallas County numerous times, the same prosecuting authority, contemporaneous with the trial, numerous occasions, had served time, and contrary to Miller-El's assertions, the State did question Mr. Fields on this issue during voir dire, and it was a basis for the strike.

argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11504 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # What about the Fifth Circuit said that comparing Rand's testimony -- that that was in line with Mazza's. The Fifth Circuit seems to recognize that those two were closely comparable.
argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11505 # TRUE # MS. BUNN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Ginsburg, they recognized, as Justice Scalia had in his concurring opinion, that that was basically as close as it got. But at most, Mazza acknowledged that the decision whether to impose a death sentence would be difficult, not an easy one, kind of hard, but she simultaneously stated that it was a decision that she believed that she could make. She never questioned her ability to assess a death sentence in an appropriate case. She merely acknowledged that it was a decision that she would not take lightly. She also had served on another criminal jury in the last couple of years, a jury which had returned a guilty verdict. In contrast, Rand explicitly questioned his ability to assess a death sentence in any case. When asked whether he could impose the death penalty, he told prosecutors right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not. He declined to describe himself as someone who believes in the death penalty and can serve as a jury -- juror and assess the death penalty if warranted, stating that he was probably in between the first two categories described by the prosecutor. Notably, Mr. Waxman referred to the prosecutors' notes on the questionnaires. What he didn't mention was also noted on the -- by the State at -- at the joint lodging, page 30, is that Juror Rand had referred to the death penalty as a touchy subject and that he had described himself as a person falling somewhere in between the two categories described by the prosecutor, the first being someone who believes in the death penalty and can assess it, the second being someone who believes in the death penalty generally but cannot personally assess it as a juror. So the State did take note of the -- of the expressions of ambivalence by Rand during his voir dire. Juror Mazza, again, never expressed this level of ambivalence. These are not similarly situated jurors. And the same is true of Miller-El's attempted comparison of Rand and -- and Juror Sandra Hearn. She expressed hesitance on assessing the death penalty in a very particular circumstance, the -- a first offense, and certainly this is not the case here. On the other hand, Rand had questioned his ability to assess a death penalty in any case and, against Hearn's State-friendly views, led to a defense challenge that was overruled. And the fact that the defense vehemently objected to her on direct appeal is further evidence that she's not similarly situated. Under Batson, Miller-El has the ultimate burden of proving purposeful discrimination. He has failed to satisfy that burden, and the State trial judge found that prosecutors in this case did not act with a discriminatory purpose. As this Court acknowledged in its earlier opinion, Miller-El is not entitled to habeas relief unless he can -- he can show that the State court's rejection of his Batson claim was objectively unreasonable. He must produce clear and convincing evidence and he has failed to do that.

argument now in the case of Miller-El against Dretke # 03-9659 # 11508 # FALSE # MR. WAXMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I have just three points. The Fifth Circuit had precisely the same record before it that this Court had and the State submitted very nearly precisely the same brief that it presented to the Fifth Circuit the time before. Disparate questioning on the minimum punishment ploy was objected to by the defense during the voir dire and it was acknowledged. If you look at the Batson argument, it's either Mr. Macaluso or Mr. Nelson said some of the jurors were questioned disparately, but -- and they gave the explanation that it had to do with views on the death penalty. So it was before the State courts. Now, on the graphic script, which is the disparate questioning that Ms. Bunn has focused the Court's attention on, the State now says, okay, we can't speculate about what we don't know about the questionnaires. Let's just look at the questionnaires that we do know about. Justice Stevens, it is -- you are quite right that that tells you nothing about the dozens of other white jurors whose questionnaires we don't have, but we don't need to indulge in that speculation in this case because what we know from the questionnaire answers that we have is that every black who expressed anything that could be called hesitation on their juror questionnaire, including just not filling in either question -- answering question 56 or 58, got it. Five whites who expressed hesitation did not. That is Juror Mazza, Juror Hearn, Juror Duke, Ms. Girard, who testified that she didn't -- who acknowledged in her voir dire that she hadn't filled out one of those questions which got similarly situated African American jurors the graphic script, and Juror Whaley who -- or Venireman Whaley who testified that her questionnaire expressed great hesitation about the death penalty. And what we also know is that the three jurors who got the graphic script, Troy Woods, the black juror; Mr. Gutierrez, the Hispanic juror; and Marie Sztybel, the only Jewish juror. If the Court has no further questions.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11515 # FALSE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Justice Stevens, and may it 9 please the Court: On occasion a prior conviction that's used to 11 enhance a Federal sentence turns out to have been obtained 12 in violation of the Constitution. This Court addressed 13 the procedure for handling those challenges in Custis and 14 Daniels. Those cases determined that, in most 15 circumstances, the facts that would show the prior 16 conviction is unconstitutional do not support a claim 17 either at sentencing or under section 2255. This is the key phrase in this case: facts 19 supporting the claim. It's the key part of the fourth 20 trigger in the 2255 statute of limitations. In this case, 21 the State court vacatur is the fact supporting the claim 22 for three reasons. First, as expressed, Daniels made clear that the 24 underlying facts, those facts that you use for the 25 challenge to the prior conviction, do not support a claim 1 under 2255, leaving the vacatur as the operative fact. Second, the plain meaning of the word fact 3 encompasses a vacatur just like courts often refer to 4 convictions as historical facts. And third, there's no reason to dispense with 6 the plain language of the statute to serve policy ends. 7 The policies animating both AEDPA and section 2255 are 8 served by the rule advanced by petitioner. And moreover, 9 petitioner's rule will be a lot more straightforward in 10 application. Let me --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11516 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # One little complication here. 13 Under 2255, even if that applies in this situation, it 14 does establish a 1-year statute of limitations. Right?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11517 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Correct.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11518 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And subsection (4) of that 17 section says: the date on which the facts supporting the 18 claim or claims presented could have been discovered 19 through the exercise of due diligence. Now, is that a 20 requirement that the defendant seek State relief on a 21 timely basis? Can the defendant just wait indefinitely 22 before going back to the State and seeking a vacatur? Or 23 does that due diligence requirement apply to the efforts 24 to get State action?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11519 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, there -- there are several 1 levels to the response. Let me work through them. The first is that the petitioner's position 3 relies on a straightforward reading of the statute, and we 4 think that the due diligence requirement is satisfied when 5 the vacatur is discovered through the exercise of due 6 diligence.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11520 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, but you're not being 8 responsive to my question. Here the defendant did go back 9 to the State courts and got this -- the earlier 10 convictions vacated. Right?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11521 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11522 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But I asked you, is there any 13 requirement that the defendant act promptly in going back 14 to the State to get the vacaturs?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11523 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There's no requirement in -- in 16 the fourth trigger. However --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11524 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, except that the statute 18 itself speaks of diligence. Now, can the -- suppose he's been given a very 20 long Federal sentence and part of that is the result of 21 prior State convictions. And suppose he waits 10 years 22 before going back to the State to seek to overturn those 23 earlier State convictions. Is there no requirement that 24 he act promptly?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11525 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # The requirement is not found in 1 the fourth trigger. The requirement is found in the State 2 statutes of limitations. And to elaborate on the 3 footnotes in our brief, we have found that there are 4 approximately --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11526 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, but the Federal statute 6 says -- it puts a burden of diligence on the defendant.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11527 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Reading the plain language, we 8 think that burden of diligence applies to discovering the 9 vacatur. If you -- if a vacatur is a fact -- and I think 10 the Government has all but --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11528 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # How -- how could one not 12 discover the vacatur? Here's my problem. I -- I frankly don't think 14 the text of -- of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably 15 with either your interpretation or the Government's. It 16 says the date on which the facts supporting the claim 17 could have been discovered through the exercise of 18 diligence. Well, as you point out in your brief, the fact 20 supporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the 21 prior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction. 22 That's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which 23 led to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur. So that makes 24 the Government's case a little uncomfortable. But it seems to me you have to acknowledge that 1 your case is pretty uncomfortable when you -- when you 2 talk about discovering the fact of the -- of the vacatur. 3 I mean, it's a matter of public record. How does one 4 discover a -- a public record? How -- how could you need 5 due diligence to discover a public record? I mean, it 6 seems to me it's -- it's automatically -- isn't the 7 vacatur always served on the -- on the person whose 8 conviction is vacated? Isn't it always that person who 9 seeks the vacation? So what sense does it make to talk 10 about his discovering that particular fact? It seems to 11 me it makes no sense. So you're left with -- with two competing 13 interpretations, both of which have some textual problems. 14 I'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense, 15 given the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the 16 statute, as Justice O'Connor has suggested, is to make 17 people bring up their claims promptly. And -- and that 18 purpose would -- would be served by the Government's rule 19 and not by yours. You say unless the State has some 20 statute of limitation, this -- this Federal requirement of 21 due diligence goes begging. What's -- what's your response to that? You 23 really think -- especially about the discover.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11529 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I do and here's why, first, 25 starting with the language before I turn to the policy 1 side of your question. On the language, paragraph (4), the fourth 3 trigger, is broad language that was meant to cover a 4 variety of circumstances, things from ineffective 5 assistance of counsel, to Brady violations, to vacaturs. 6 I'll grant you that if Congress only intended the vacatur 7 situation to be covered by paragraph (4), we might wonder 8 why they chose those particular words, but we know they 9 didn't intend this one circumstance. I think the Government's position as to discover 11 boils down to this. Because the answer to the question, 12 when could the vacatur have been discovered through 13 reasonable diligence, is easy, the answer must be wrong. 14 And we don't believe that to be the case. We think that 15 you can easily ask when could the vacatur have been 16 discovered through the exercise of reasonable --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11530 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # And when it could have been 18 discovered I guess if he had taken due diligence and gone 19 and made the motion within a year, at least, of his having 20 been convicted in the Federal court. I mean, I don't see how you can have it both 22 ways. You want us to read that phrase very broadly to 23 include under the word facts something like a vacatur, and 24 then it sounds to me you're being very literal and 25 linguistic when you say that due diligence to find the 1 facts shouldn't mean what I would take it as ordinarily 2 meaning, that -- that you have to, when you had a chance, 3 go back and generate this fact.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11531 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I --

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11533 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I think we can. I think both the 8 interpretations of each of those contested words are 9 strict interpretations right within the plain meaning. 10 And our case can boil down to asking whether there's 11 something wrong with my English language when I say, on 12 what day could the vacatur have been discovered through 13 the exercise of due diligence. It's --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11534 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # On the pure English language, 15 it's not exactly a fact.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11535 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11536 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I mean, it's a legal 18 determination. We usually separate law from fact.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11537 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # And -- and as we point out in our 20 brief, there's nothing -- in this context in particular, a 21 vacatur is like a conviction. It's a fact, you know, that 22 is -- is commonly referred to by the court.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11538 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Well, just so that I understand 24 your argument then, going back to Justice O'Connor's 25 question, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there 1 for 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier 2 conviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with 3 due diligence I'm here at the courthouse because, although 4 I waited 10 years, I have brought my 2255 as soon as I 5 learned that my earlier sentence had been vacated? Your 6 answer to that question, I take it, is yes, he satisfies 7 the statute.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11539 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # He satisfies the statute, but I 9 need to point out something that I think is critical to 10 understanding this question. At the end of the day, we're 11 talking about at most six States where this might be at 12 issue. The rest of them either have laches or statutes of 13 limitations. And these are small States. We're talking 14 about a rule --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11540 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Okay, but in -- in six States, 16 I would have thought that, A, the due diligence language, 17 together with the general obvious policy of AEDPA, to get 18 this over with, would have made it very difficult to 19 conclude that he can sit there without doing anything for 20 10 years.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11541 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11542 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Maybe it's only in six States, 23 but six States count.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11543 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # They do count. But it ties into 25 the response -- the second part of Justice Scalia's 1 question is, isn't finality served? Isn't that what AEDPA 2 is all about? We don't believe that the Government's rule 3 that they propose will serve finality in the vast majority 4 of cases because in the vast majority of cases, you're 5 talking about claims that will have no merit in State 6 court. But because it's very difficult to complete the 7 State court habeas process before the 1 year in the first 8 paragraph, these petitioners will file placeholder 9 petitions in Federal court and have them held while they 10 finish their State court review. So what you're doing is 11 you're talking about these six States, maybe 10 guys a 12 year, you're going to cause, as the Brackett court on 13 remand said, thousands of placeholder petitions to be 14 filed, and you're needlessly extending all of those cases 15 so that you cut off the rights for maybe 10 people who 16 happen to be in these States.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11544 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # All right. Here's -- here's a 18 simple way of looking at it. The minute that you're 19 convicted and you are subject to the enhanced sentence 20 based on a prior conviction, the obligation of due 21 diligence begins. You can't sit there for 10 years. 22 That's the point at which you've got to file your petition 23 so that you can come into court with reasonable 24 promptness, if not by the sentencing hearing itself, as 25 soon afterwards as the State process allows you. That would be a simple due diligence point. It 2 wouldn't involve placeholder petitions, and it would get 3 things concluded with reasonable promptness. Why isn't 4 that a way of -- of applying the statute?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11545 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Because if you were going to be 6 strict about it -- and -- and I'm not sure I understand 7 all of the parameters of the hypothetical -- in --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11546 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # Easy. The minute he's 9 convicted, the State has charged him and -- and -- or his 10 -- by some charging document has made clear that there is 11 going to be an invocation of a prior conviction for an 12 enhanced sentence. As soon as he is convicted of the 13 later offense in which that sentencing possibility has 14 been raised, he has an obligation to go into the State 15 court and start the process of -- of getting his earlier 16 conviction vacated. Easy.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11547 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # If Mr. Johnson had done that in 18 this case, he still would have missed the 1-year statute 19 of limitations. If Mr. Gadsen had done that in the Fourth 20 Circuit case by Judge Wilkinson, he still would have 21 missed the 1-year statute of limitations.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11548 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # But he would have acted with 23 due diligence and he would have had as -- I suppose, a 24 very powerful argument, which -- which the Government 25 apparently would accept, for -- for tolling.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11549 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # For equitable tolling? Well, I 2 don't know that the Government would accept equitable 3 tolling.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11550 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Well, as I understood Justice 5 Souter's question, it is the alternate that the Government 6 said. The Government puts forward two arguments, and its 7 alternate argument sounds to me just like what Justice 8 Souter put to you, that is, he has to move diligently to 9 challenge those underlying convictions, that he cannot 10 challenge in Federal court because of -- was it -- Curtis 11 and Daniels. Why isn't that an -- an accommodation of what we 13 know was the concern of the Federal court -- of the -- of 14 the Congress that people act diligently? It happens that 15 2255 wasn't framed with Curtis and Daniels in mind. There 16 isn't any indication that the drafters of 2255 were aware 17 of this peculiar situation where you can't make the 18 challenge in Federal court, you must go back to the State 19 forum. But we do know they were concerned with diligence.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11551 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, AEDPA was enacted after 21 Custis was decided and I think we presume that the 22 Congress was aware of the precedent, but the --

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11553 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Yes, he did. The -- the -- our answer --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11554 # TRUE # JUSTICE O'CONNOR # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # PETITIONER # I'm not sure that was a 4 diligent sort of a -- an effort.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11555 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # We believe it was diligent within 6 the -- the fourth trigger because, again, we rely on the 7 plain language. And the -- the fall-back position, to 8 address your question and Justice Souter's question, is 9 that we don't believe -- we believe this is engrafting a 10 whole different statutory scheme on top of the one that we 11 have. The fall-back position of the Government is to say, 12 all right, let's interpret the statute or rewrite it to 13 say that we're going to trigger the date on when the 14 vacatur could have been obtained, not when it could have 15 been discovered. And to do that, what they're saying is, 16 well, let's give him a year from the time of the Federal 17 sentencing. So -- or -- or maybe even earlier, dating 18 back to the time of the original conviction in State 19 court. So they add that 1-year statute of limitations. 20 Then they say then we'll add a provision that tolls during 21 the pendency of State habeas, and then we'll add another 22 1-year statute of limitations on top of that after the 23 vacatur is obtained. So we end up with -- instead of the 24 plain language, we have two 1-year statutes of limitations 25 with a tolling provision in between, the type of tolling 1 provision that is, by the way, in section 2244. We believe that petitioner's interpretation, 3 although the answer is not difficult, it -- it is the 4 correct answer. On what date did the -- could the vacatur 5 have been discovered through the exercise of due 6 diligence? And the answer I think was --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11556 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # But then you -- you have to 8 concede that you are watering down almost to nothing any 9 due diligence requirement because on your reading of the 10 statute, there isn't -- there isn't any such requirement.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11557 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, we think that that is -- 12 I'll -- I'll say that there's no -- we don't believe that 13 there is a requirement in the Federal statute, in 14 agreement with -- with your statement, to exercise 15 diligence and seeking the vacatur. But we believe that 16 that is a necessary consequence of the administrative 17 decision that this Court made in Custis and Daniels to 18 send these back to the State court. It -- it could have been the case that these 20 were all challenged at sentencing, and in fact, I think 21 that was the prevailing practice before Custis, that they 22 were challenged at sentencing. But Custis and then 23 followed on by Daniels made a different decision, and I 24 think a good one. It made the decision to wrap these 25 challenges back to the State and that inevitably will 1 result in delays as it works it way through the State. The rationale for the Court's decision makes 3 perfect sense when you apply it to this context. One of 4 the key concerns, it seems to me, that the Court had was 5 that if you allow these Federal challenges that are 6 outside the State statute of limitations, then it's very 7 possible the State is not going to have the records 8 necessary to defend it because they wouldn't be expected 9 to keep records outside of their statute of limitations. And that's simply not the case here because 11 these challenges, under the petitioner's rule, would be 12 within the State statutes of limitations, and as this 13 Court recognized in Daniels, the States have a powerful 14 interest in defending their convictions and that powerful 15 interest, it seems to me, would lead them to preserve the 16 records necessary to maintain their convictions.

I'm 3 -- I'm -- I was trying not to overreach, but I went with 4 the cases that States that were clear that laches would 5 apply either by statute or by case law. And why this becomes particularly important to 7 me is because we think the petitioner's rule serves the 8 ends of the Federal court overall, especially when you're 9 talking about finality because it seems to be the tail 10 wagging the dog, in a way, to have a rule that cuts off 11 the possibility of the 10-year scenario for these few 12 cases and then causes thousands of placeholder petitions 13 to be filed and managed. And it has been pointed, you 14 know, average non-merits dismissal, we're talking about 15 roughly 260 days. It's a burden on the court that's 16 unnecessary, particularly to bring it back, when we think 17 that in light of Custis and Daniels, the plain language 18 takes us all the way there.

With respect to -- he came into 3 Federal court and he said -- a little -- like 3 days too 4 late to move to extend the time to file the 2255. That 5 motion was denied. That motion was made in April of '97, 6 and then he doesn't file for State habeas to get rid of 7 those prior convictions until February of '98. Is -- is 8 there any indication of why, when the Federal court says 9 we're not going to extend your time, he waits so long to 10 go to the State court?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11574 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # There's -- I'm aware of the 12 facts, but there's none in the record other than the fact 13 that he's pro se and has limited education. I want to point out one thing that -- that I 15 think is important perhaps, if -- if the Court were to go 16 a way of equitable tolling, which as I've said, I don't 17 believe is appropriate. But you mentioned that it was 3 18 days too late that he filed. Looking back at the record, 19 I -- I don't think that's accurate. It shows that it was 20 received by the court on April 25th, 1997, which is 1 day 21 after the grace period under AEDPA which -- it expired on 22 April 24th, 1997. Well, he did it by mail, and under the 23 mailbox rule, that would have been a timely motion to the 24 extent that we are concerned with equitable tolling and -- 25 and permitting the placeholder petition of that kind. But again, this -- this difficulty in managing 2 the process is familiar to the court because it -- it's 3 what happens when you have these pro se petitioners. The important thing in this case, we believe, 5 the core concern is with the plain language of the 6 statute. Because Daniels in substance said, the 7 underlying facts to a State court vacatur do not support a 8 claim, we believe that you have to read section 2255, 9 paragraph (4) to say that, okay, then the operative fact 10 is a vacatur. And this case -- it's a very real concern 12 because without the prior convictions that were later 13 vacated, Mr. Johnson would have a roughly 7-year sentence. 14 Those prior convictions that were vacated -- and we all 15 can conclude now were unconstitutional -- added 8 more 16 years on his sentence. He's serving more time on the 17 enhancements than he was on the underlying sentence. And 18 of course, the sentencing scheme depends on reliability of 19 the information used for purposes of sentencing, and 20 that's why Congress chose to enact the fourth paragraph 21 and the statute of limitations so that there would be an 22 opportunity to correct unreliable information when it came 23 to light and it was discovered. If there are no further questions, I would 25 reserve the remainder of my time.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11577 # FALSE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Stevens, and may it 6 please the Court: Petitioner's State court habeas corpus petition, 8 which challenged his guilty plea on a ground available at 9 the time of the plea, was filed nearly 9 years after the 10 plea was entered and nearly 2 years after a subsequent 11 Federal conviction became final. Petitioner, 12 nevertheless, contends that the challenge to his Federal 13 sentence was timely under AEDPA's 1-year statute of 14 limitations because it was filed within a year of the date 15 on which his State conviction was vacated. That 16 interpretation, which enables a defendant to extend the 17 limitation period for challenging his Federal conviction 18 by delaying a challenge to his State conviction, is 19 fundamentally at odds with the statutory text, the 20 statutory purpose, and the overall statutory scheme. To begin with the statutory scheme, under clause 22 (1) of AEDPA's limitation provision, the presumptive rule 23 is that a defendant wishing to -- to collaterally 24 challenge a Federal conviction has a year from the date on 25 which the conviction becomes final. Clauses (2), (3) -- (2), (3), and (4) create 2 exceptions to that general rule when a prisoner is unable 3 to comply with the rule in clause (1) for reasons beyond 4 his control. The fundamental flaw in petitioner's 5 interpretation is that it would excuse compliance with the 6 presumptive rule in clause (1) for a reason that is not 7 beyond his control, a failure to exercise diligence in 8 challenging his State conviction. Petitioner's interpretation is also inconsistent 10 with the statutory purpose of the limitation provision.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11578 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, are you saying that (4) 12 is inapplicable?
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11579 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Justice Kennedy. We agree 14 that (4) is applicable in a case like this. It's just 15 that our position is that petitioner's interpretation of 16 it is wrong. We offer two alternative interpretations of 17 how paragraph 6(4) would apply in a case like this. Before I get to them, I'd like to respond to a 19 question that you asked when petitioner's counsel was 20 standing up here, and that had to do with the difficulty 21 of getting everything that needed to be done done in the 22 space of a year. It's critical to keep in mind that in the 24 typical case of this type, the factual basis for the State 25 claim is going to available at the time of the State 1 guilty or trial, which in almost every case is going to be 2 years before the Federal conviction becomes final. And 3 since the limitation provision under AEDPA runs from the 4 latest of the four dates, in a typical case a defendant is 5 going to have many years to seek the vacatur of a State 6 conviction and he'll have up until a year after his 7 Federal conviction becomes final to challenge it.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11585 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # The -- the State does have an 5 interest. The problem is that when there's a delay in 6 filing a challenge to a State conviction, one of two 7 things can be happen -- can happen, and the cases bear 8 this out. One is that you have a State prosecutor who is 9 perfectly diligent and wants to defend the conviction but, 10 because of the lapse of time, can't because the requisite 11 records aren't available. The other thing you see in some 12 of these cases is that because the State sentence has been 13 served by the time it's challenged in cases of this type, 14 the State prosecutor doesn't have the same kind of 15 incentive --

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11596 # TRUE # MR.

Most of these -- I think it is fair to say that 15 most of the State convictions, like most convictions in -- 16 in general, are going to rest on -- on guilty pleas. It 17 just is not realistic to assume that Congress assumed a 18 due diligence system which was going to require a State 19 defendant immediately to start a collateral attack on a 20 guilty plea. I mean, if -- if there -- if there were 21 reasons for the collateral attack that seemed strong and 22 worthwhile, he wouldn't have been entering the guilty 23 plea. And it seems to me that if we're going to 25 measure due diligence from the date of conviction, most 1 convictions resting on pleas, as a practical matter under 2 your system, a conviction that rests on a plea is never 3 going to be subject to a timely challenge for purposes of 4 applying 2255.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11612 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's right. We think that's 2 consistent with the text because the diligence has to be 3 connected in some way to the facts supporting the claim, 4 and we think you could take the view that in a case of 5 this type, particularly given the diligence requirement, 6 the facts supporting the claim either means the facts 7 supporting the State claim or it means the vacatur of the 8 State conviction.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11613 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Yes, but isn't it -- I guess my 10 problem is isn't -- isn't it a sense -- isn't your 11 argument for a sense of diligence which is really other 12 wordly? At the moment the defendant's conviction based 13 upon his plea becomes final, it simply is unrealistic to 14 expect that any defendant would have an incentive to 15 attack that conviction. And -- and the result, it seems 16 to me, of -- of your position, your preferred position, is 17 if -- if diligence is measured from that moment, that no 18 defendant will ever be diligent because no defendant will 19 ever have an incentive at that point to be diligent.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11614 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, Justice Souter, the -- we 21 think that there's a -- a textual problem with the 22 interpretation you're offering because it doesn't tie 23 diligence to facts supporting a claim.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11615 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # Well, how about the one you're 25 offering?

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11616 # TRUE # MR.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11617 # TRUE # JUSTICE SOUTER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # That's -- that's right.

And essentially what the Court 20 said is that whatever the incentives may be at the time of 21 the State conviction, the remedies are available, the 22 procedures are available. And if a defendant does not 23 avail himself of those remedies and procedures, at a 24 minimum he will know that so long as his State conviction 25 remains on the books, if he goes out and commits another 1 crime, he runs a risk that he will be subject to an 2 enhanced sentence based on the fact that he's committed 3 the prior crime.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11633 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # All right. Now, my question actually is the -- aside from 22 Justice Souter's practical point, it seemed to me that the 23 language here is different from Daniels and different in 24 the other cases. The language is the date on which facts 25 supporting the claim or claims presented could have been 1 discovered. And facts supporting the claim prior to there 2 being a claim are not facts supporting the claim. And 3 therefore, it seems as if it would run no later than the 4 moment when he presents the Federal claim. No earlier 5 than that could it run. So you have a year from the time 6 that you present the Federal claim. At that point, all 7 those facts that could have been discovered earlier, now 8 he has a year to call them to the attention of the court. And of course, for reasons that you point out, 10 this is certainly a fact that could have been discovered 11 earlier. He could have brought his motion long before. So what's wrong with that? It combines the 13 practical reason that Justice Souter mentioned with the 14 language of the statute.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11634 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Let me comment on the language, 16 if I could. If one were to read the phrase, facts 17 supporting the claim, completely in isolation, keeping in 18 mind only Daniels, but ignoring the broader statutory 19 context and the statutory purpose, it might well be the 20 case that the better reading is that the facts supporting 21 the claim is the vacatur of the State conviction not the 22 factual basis for the State claim. But if you take into account the broader 24 statutory context and statutory purpose, in particular if 25 you take into account the due diligence requirement, we 1 think the better reading is that facts supporting the 2 claim, in the context of this limitation provision, is the 3 factual basis for the State claim. It is true --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11635 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But I -- I thought that you 5 conceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim 6 is the vacatur. I -- I thought that you opened up with 7 that. And it -- it --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11636 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No, Justice Kennedy. What I 9 was agreeing to was the idea that a vacatur of a 10 conviction is a fact because in the lower court decision, 11 there seems to be some reliance on the idea that that's 12 not a fact at all. But in responding to Justice Breyer's 13 question --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11637 # TRUE # JUSTICE KENNEDY # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # Well, the minute -- the minute 15 that you -- you say that, it -- it seems to me that you 16 have to accept the petitioner's argument.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11638 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # I don't think so, Justice 18 Kennedy, and here's why. It is a true in a case of this 19 type that the facts supporting the claim -- excuse me -- 20 the factual basis for the State claim is not the facts 21 supporting the Federal claim in a direct or proximate or 22 immediate or sufficient sense. It is the facts supporting 23 the Federal claim in an indirect, a but for, a once 24 removed, or a necessary sense. If a defendant has served 25 his State sentence, he's been sentenced to an enhanced 1 Federal sentence and he wants to challenge his Federal 2 sentence and he's armed with a factual predicate for a 3 State claim, so long as he takes the intermediate step of 4 going into Federal court and obtaining a vacatur of the 5 conviction, he can challenge his Federal sentence.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11639 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # I'm certainly not taking -- 7 advocating the -- the defendant's position. I'm 8 advocating the position as follows. Suppose it were not a vacatur. Suppose it were 10 a DNA test, and suppose it were a fact that the DNA test 11 identified a different perpetrator of a long-gone State 12 crime and it was definite. Now, if no one thought of running that DNA test, 14 although they should have, until 4 years after the Federal 15 conviction, he's out of luck. He has 1 year from the 16 Federal conviction, and that 1 year he has to, during that 17 year, do everything, including bringing facts into being, 18 such as the result of the DNA test, that he had not 19 previously done. And that's consistent with the language. 20 It avoids Justice Souter's practical problem, and it does 21 not impose an unreasonable burden on the Government, I 22 wouldn't think, because he has just a year from 23 conviction.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11640 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Justice Breyer, under our view, 25 the hypothetical you just gave would be one where a timely 1 2255 motion could be filed. If the DNA evidence were 2 discoverable in the exercise of due diligence only more 3 than a year after the Federal conviction became final such 4 that the defendant would not be within paragraph 6(1), he 5 would be able to file a timely 2255 motion under paragraph 6 6(4) if, within a year from the date that the DNA evidence 7 was discoverable through the exercise of due diligence, he 8 filed his State motion to get his State conviction 9 vacated, and allowing tolling of the period while the 10 State motion is pending, then filed his Federal motion 11 within that same 1-year period, he would be able to file a 12 timely 2255 motion. That's under our primary 13 interpretation.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11641 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # From your answer, I take it 15 then you would agree with Judge Black in the Eleventh 16 Circuit that equitable tolling would apply. He goes to 17 State court within the year after his Federal conviction 18 becomes final. The State court is sitting on it for 2 19 years. The limitation, I take it from what you said, 20 would be tolled during that time.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11642 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 22 Under our primary interpretation, there would be tolling 23 during the 1-year period of the time while the motion, the 24 State motion, is pending in State court. Our alternative interpretation doesn't depend on 1 tolling because it doesn't begin to run until the vacatur 2 of the State conviction could have been obtained. So it's 3 just the -- the time while the State motion is pending is 4 just excluded from the calculation as a matter of course 5 under our second interpretation.

As I understand your basic 8 position, if the defendant lets things sit for too long, 9 he loses the right to challenge the State conviction. On 10 the -- and -- and what's -- what's at stake is an 11 enhancement based on the -- on the prior conviction. Is 12 there ever a time when the Federal Government loses the 13 right to use a very old conviction for enhancement 14 purposes?

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11651 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, that -- I think that's 10 actually a critical point, Justice Kennedy, because our 11 view is that a -- a State defendant should be required to 12 challenge his State conviction at the earliest possible 13 opportunity, and in most cases that will be soon after his 14 conviction in State court because that will be the time 15 when he knows about the basis for his State claim. If he 16 does that, by the time he gets to the Federal sentencing, 17 you're not going to have the issue in this case because 18 all will agree that that vacated State conviction can't be 19 counted towards his Federal sentence. So that's one of 20 the virtues of the interpretation we offer. It avoids 21 this circumstance entirely.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11652 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But you're not -- you're not 23 insisting on that super diligence because you say, well, 24 in every case he has at least a year to begin to try to 25 undo the State conviction.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11653 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That -- that's right, Justice 2 Ginsburg. We agree with that. The -- the purpose of AEDPA's limitation 4 provision, to use this Court's language in Duncan v. 5 Walker, is to reduce the potential for delay on the road 6 to finality by restricting the time that a prospective 7 habeas petitioner has in which to seek habeas review. We 8 think petitioner's interpretation is inconsistent with 9 that purpose not only because it permits a delay in 10 challenging the State conviction and, as a consequence, in 11 challenging the Federal sentence, but because it 12 encourages it. As I mentioned before, the longer a 13 prisoner waits to challenge his State conviction, other 14 things being the same, the greater the likelihood of 15 success either because the necessary records that the 16 State would need to defend the judgment are unavailable or 17 because the State prosecutor has less of an incentive to 18 defend it than he might have while the sentence was still 19 being served.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11658 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, the -- the important 13 point is that -- we think is that petitioner's 14 interpretation doesn't work because it gives a defendant 15 an indefinite period to challenge his State conviction, 16 and the only diligence that's required under his 17 interpretation is that you have to exercise diligence in 18 seeing whether the motion to vacate your State conviction 19 was granted whenever it was filed.

But in light of the due diligence requirement 5 at the end of paragraph 6(4), the question is when could 6 that vacatur have been obtained and thus discovered 7 through the exercise of due diligence.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11670 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # As to your first question, 23 Justice Stevens, one -- one would think that this is a 24 little bit of an unusual situation and you don't see too 25 many cases where it arises. Perhaps surprisingly, though, 1 there are quite a few reported decisions where this 2 arises. There is a 2 to 1 circuit split on this question. 3 There are some district courts from other circuits that 4 have weighed in. I believe there may be three or four 5 certiorari petitions pending in this Court from the 6 Eleventh Circuit that raise the same question. As to whether Congress ever considered this 8 situation, I'm not aware of anything in the legislative 9 history that is an affirmative indication that it did. It 10 could well be --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11671 # TRUE # JUSTICE STEVENS # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # And certainly they would have 12 phrased the statute one way or the other more clearly. 13 They could have done that.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11672 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # That could well be, but of 15 course, it wouldn't be the -- the first time the Court 16 confronted a situation where there's a statutory text and 17 there's a set of facts that Congress didn't necessarily 18 consider when it was writing the text. So we think our -- either our primary or our 20 fall-back position is preferable to petitioner's 21 interpretation for the fundamental reason that his 22 interpretation does not require diligence. It enables the 23 defendant to extend the limitation period through his own 24 actions, and we think it's simply foreign to the whole 25 notion of statutes of limitations to say that the 1 limitation period can be determined by actions that are 2 within the prisoner's control. The court of appeals --

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11674 # TRUE # MR.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11675 # TRUE # JUSTICE BREYER # JUSTICE # RESPONDENT # RESPONDENT # All right. Then -- then once 16 you admit that, you're going to have to find a difference 17 between this and the DNA test, or your position here, if 18 adopted, will catch you out there.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11676 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # No. We don't think so because 20 we think that the analysis should be the same for this 21 case as it is for your typical case involving a statute of 22 limitations with a discovery rule. The question is on the 23 facts of this case, when could the factual basis of the 24 claim been discovered given the totality of the 25 information available to the plaintiff through the 1 exercise of due diligence. So we think it's precisely the 2 same situation.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11677 # TRUE # JUSTICE SCALIA # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # RESPONDENT # But you're still asking us -- I 4 mean, even -- even in your fall-back position -- your -- 5 your principal position asks us to -- to play games with 6 the -- with the word facts, and your fall-back position 7 asks us to play games with the word discovered.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11678 # TRUE # MR. HIMMELFARB # NOT JUSTICE # NA # RESPONDENT # Well, you're right, Justice 12 Scalia. The fall-back position presumes the correctness 13 of petitioner's interpretation of facts supporting the 14 claim.

argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11681 # FALSE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # I hope not. The Government's position boils down to this. 22 They're advocating for the statute they want, not the 23 statute they have. This statute says the fact that could 24 have been discovered with exercise of due diligence. And 25 once -- as this Court -- several Justices have recognized 1 once you admit that the vacatur is a fact, the 2 Government's entire argument unravels because what the 3 Government would have -- this Court holds -- is that the 4 facts supporting the claim is exactly what it held it 5 couldn't be in Daniels. The -- underlying the Government's argument is, 7 I think, a principle that -- that does not make sense. 8 It's that the State can't be trusted to handle the 9 challenges to prior convictions. I think that is not only 10 against experience. It also cuts against this Court's 11 decisions, in particular, about Daniels. It talked about 12 the State having a strong interest in maintaining its 13 convictions. The idea about AEDPA and finality I think is 15 also important. To answer your question, Justice Stevens, 16 no, this is not the most important case this Court has 17 ever heard. And I think that that ties into an important 18 point. To use my rough numbers, we're talking about at 19 this point with the six States, less than 10 guys that 20 might be in this 10-year scenario per year. I think 21 probably the number is more like three people per year. 22 And if the Brackett court, the court on the front lines 23 down there in the district court, the First Circuit is 24 right, we're talking about the results of the Government's 25 rule to be that thousands of placeholder petitions will be 1 filed so that petitioners don't lose their rights to 2 challenge their Federal sentence based on the vacatur of 3 their prior sentences. And when -- when I think about 4 what serves the ends of the statute and finality overall, 5 I think that to prolong all these other cases, these 6 thousands of cases --
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11682 # TRUE # JUSTICE GINSBURG # JUSTICE # PETITIONER # PETITIONER # Why would you need the 8 placeholder if the rule were, as Judge Black said it 9 should be, that if you go to the State court within the 1 10 year after your Federal conviction becomes final, then the 11 time that you are in the State court the statute will be 12 tolled? If that's the rule, then you don't need any 13 placeholder filings.
argument in 4 Johnson against the United States # 03-9685 # 11683 # TRUE # MR. REICHMAN # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Two responses to that. First, if 15 that is the rule, I'm not sure I read the Eleventh Circuit 16 to be so crisp on it that you definitely get tolling. I 17 think it was a case-by-case determination. And anytime 18 you're in a soft -- what I call soft equitable tolling 19 situation where you don't know for sure, that's going to 20 lead to placeholder petitions. Alternatively, if we're talking about a rule 22 that's a hard equitable tolling rule, that is, there is 23 tolling every time there's the pendency of the State 24 petition, well, it seems to me that we are adding a 25 provision very expressly to the statute that doesn't 1 exist. 2244 has exactly that tolling provision, and that 2 is not in this -- in the 2255 provision. And this Court 3 would be adding it, and we don't think that is 4 appropriate. At the end of the day, there's been a question 6 about doesn't a tie go to the Government in this case 7 because of finality. That is, if both interpretations are 8 equally plausible, because of finality, doesn't it go to 9 the Government? Of course, you've heard me contest we 10 don't think it's a tie. We also don't think finality cuts 11 in the favor of the Government. But even assuming we have a tie, we think that 13 -- that should -- the tie goes to the petitioner because 14 this statute is recognized in Clay as in derogation of 15 common law, and statutes and derogation of common law are 16 to be strictly construed. Thank you.

CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the government acts to remove government-imposed burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate the Establishment Clause. Rather, as this Court put the point in Zorach against Clauson, when the government eases those kind of burdens, it follows the best of our traditions. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA, eases government burdens on restrictions by having institutions and prison officials examine burdens on religious exercise and remove unjustified, substantial burdens.

CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that -- that that doesn't make any substantial difference, in part, I think because if you think about certainly this application of RLUIPA, it's Spending Clause legislation. And spending legislation often takes the form of giving the States an incentive to take action on their own. And in this sense, I think you can understand this legislation as giving the States an opportunity to remove their own burdens on religious exercise. And that's precisely how it works in practice. The relevant action that a State takes is State action in removing its own burdens, not Federal action imposed on the States. And I think that's consistent with the analysis of this Court in the Dole case where the Federal Government, on the assumption of this Court, didn't have the direct power under the 21st Amendment to raise the drinking age, but it could give the option to the States to exercise their power to do it. So I do think in the end, the burdens that are removed here are attributable to the State of Ohio, not to the Federal Government. It is also true that the standard that's imposed by RLUIPA is a more exacting standard than that imposed by the Federal Constitution itself. But I don't think providing for greater accommodation of religious exercise than the Federal Constitution creates an Establishment Clause problem.

Or another way of answering that is I would say that even though you thought there was an Establishment Clause problem in the City of Boerne case, I don't think you need to find one here. And part of that is because this is more targeted legislation, and it particularly deals, as -- as it comes to this Court in this application, with the exercise of religion in prisons. And I think that's an area like the military where the Government is necessarily going to be involved with religion in a way that it otherwise wouldn't be.

It is a balancing test, and I think things like getting beer every day, getting marijuana inside prison walls would not satisfy the test.

argument next in No. 03-9877, Jon Cutter v. Reginald Wilkinson # 03-9877 # 11713 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # -- peyote outside of prison would be justified even under that standard. I would think, a fortiori, it would be justified within prison walls. I want to make another point about the incentives, though, which I think is important. Every State in the Union provides some degree of accommodation for religion, and in many States it's majoritarian religions that are accommodated. Now, if there's going to be some incentive to engage in religiosity in prison in order to take advantage of things offered for religion that aren't available for something else, at least RLUIPA has the virtue of making sure that all religions are accommodated neutrally. So if there's any incentive, it's an incentive for religion over irreligion as opposed to between sects -- sects of religions, and I think that's the way you would have without RLUIPA involved. The other point I want to make is although there may be some extravagant claims of certain religions that would seem quite enticing, much religious exercise in many of the reported cases involve things that I don't think people are necessarily lining up to do. I mean, there are a number of lower court cases dealing with the availability of kosher food, and in prison what that means as a practical matter, is generally you are going to get cold food rather than hot food. And I don't think --

I also think, though, it's worth noting how the Federal Government and the Bureau of Prisons has dealt with the concern that religious medallions, as opposed to beards, would be used for gang identification or gang signification. Ohio, I take it, takes the position that if you have a medallion that could be used for those purposes, you can't have it within prison walls at all. The Bureau of Prisons, by contrast, takes the position that you can have the medallion, but you have to wear it inside your shirt. So it can't be used for prison signification purposes or gang identification purposes. And I think that shows the kind of reasonable accommodation that RLUIPA or RFRA, as it applies to the Federal Bureau of Prisons --

And I think this Court in Widmar against Vincent, for example, suggested that avoiding Establishment Clause problems is a sufficient compelling interest. I would think equally avoiding the Equal Protection Clause violation in that context would also be a compelling interest, and I don't think there would be a least restrictive alternative. And so I think that the statute -- there would be no statutory violation in refusing that particular accommodation. I think there -- these show that there are ways to administer this statute in a way that's respectful of the decisions of local prison officials but also does make sure that they have a degree of sensitivity to these claims for religious exercise.

CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court has been clear in the context of legislative accommodations of religion in particular to make clear that that preference of religion over irreligion doesn't mean that the government cannot provide legislative accommodations of religion without providing benefits for secular organizations as well. That was the clear holding of this Court in Amos. And I think that although this Court has expressed concerns about religious accommodations when there's no guarantee that the religious accommodation will be provided to other sects -- take, for example, the Kiryas Joel case. This Court has been quite clear that there is not a constitutional problem in favoring religion over irreligion in providing legislative accommodations for religion. And as I said, in -- in Zorach against Clauson, this Court noted that that's not just the absence of a constitutional problem, but there's really a constitutional virtue in the legislature acting to accommodate religion. The Court made basically the same point in Smith in saying that even though the Free Exercise Clause did not require the special accommodation or exemption for peyote, the legislatures could do so and in doing so, they would be furthering constitutional values. If I could say a few words about the Spending Clause claim that is brought by Ohio in this case. They suggest that there's a difficulty with this legislation under the Spending Clause. Now, the court below --

CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I think it is not in the questions presented themselves, I don't think, but I think it would be fairly open to this Court to reach it because it would be an alternative ground to support the judgment below. That said, this Court doesn't have to reach it and its practice in recent cases has been when there's one constitutional claim that is -- that the Court has ruled on below, it doesn't necessarily reach the other -- the other constitutional claims. The Court did that in cases like Oakland Cannabis and the Pierce County case. And we would urge the same course here because, although the courts have divided on this Establishment Clause issue, the courts have not divided on the Spending Clause issue. All the courts that have reached it have upheld it as valid Spending Clause legislation. And I think that reflects the fact that there is a clear nexus here between the Federal funds and the Federal conditions that are being imposed. If the Federal Government is going to provide money, over $1 million to Ohio, to have prisoner meals, then certainly the Federal Government can insist that kosher meals are among the available options. And so too if the -- if the Federal Government is going to provide monies for Ohio to build prisons, they can ensure that those prisons are safe and are operated consistent with Federal policy such that there's not discrimination on the basis of race or religion. The last issue in the case, of course, is the Commerce Clause issue, and on that issue, no court below reached the issue. And we think this Court's recent admonition in the Sabri case that facial challenges are best when infrequent, applies with particular force here because --

So I have to show that there's no Establishment Clause violation, which we -- we've certainly made that argument in the brief and here today, and that there's no Spending Clause violation, and that there's no Commerce Clause violation. The -- in this case the Commerce Clause claim has a completely abstract quality, and indeed, the only temptation to reach the issue at all would be that the -- since RLUIPA has a jurisdictional element, the resolution of the Commerce Clause is so clear that it might be tempting to reach it. But I think the better course would be for this Court to allow that issue to be sorted out in the -- in the lower courts. If there are no further questions, I would reserve time for rebuttal.

There is a Wicca chaplain that's been hired by the Department of Corrections in Wisconsin. Two of my former students, who are upstanding members of the bar in every respect, are Asatrus, so that these are matters that should be preserved for the court below. This Court has made -- asked many questions about the accommodation of religion, and the suggestion is, well, isn't there favoritism? Doesn't it encourage favoritism one way or the other? But the answer to each of those questions is the same with respect to the current accommodations already provided by the Ohio Department of Corrections with respect to mainstream religions, and in fact, we believe on remand, we will be able to show that there is a preference for accommodating mainstream religions as opposed to non-mainstream religions. Similarly, there has -- there are -- there have been questions by this Court that -- that the standard imposed on the State of Ohio by RLUIPA is this particularly difficult or tortuous standard. In fact, under State law in Humphrey v.

So to the extent that there's a little less deference here than under the O'Lone standard, that is a modification. The centrality requirement, though, is not something that can be charged to RLUIPA or to RFRA because even before the Smith case, this Court in Ling and Hernandez was moving away from centrality and --

argument next in No. 03-9877, Jon Cutter v. Reginald Wilkinson # 03-9877 # 11907 # TRUE # MR. CLEMENT # NOT JUSTICE # NA # PETITIONER # Well, I -- I think that's right, and I think there is not that centrality requirement for accommodations. I do want to make the point, though, that -- that Ohio already, under its State constitution, has this heightened review with a lot of these, you know, least restrictive alternative tests and the like. Nobody thinks Ohio's constitution violates the Federal Constitution. That's true even though Ohio applies it in the prison context, at least when it's a claim by a guard rather than an inmate. That -- those are the facts of Humphrey against Lane. It's also true that many of Ohio's arguments would suggest their own accommodations of some religions would give too much of an incentive for religious exercise and the like. And I think that's a defect as well. I don't think -- and I agree with Justice Souter in this regard -- that narrower accommodations actually raise more constitutional problems than broader accommodations. I think that this Court, for example, in Caldor dealt with an accommodation that was at a fairly high level of generality, but yet this Court said and Justice O'Connor emphasized in her concurrence, well, that's a preference for Sabbatarian religions. And I think you avoid that with this kind of across-the-board test. Justice Kennedy, you made a point about whether this is extreme in the degree that it accommodates religion, but it's certainly no more extreme than the -- than the laws and constitutions of 26 States, which across the board apply this heightened scrutiny to all manner of State actions. So in that sense, the fact that it accommodates religion kind of wholesale with a broader standard, as opposed to retail, I don't think is a constitutional defect. The last point I wanted to make is on the racist literature hypothetical, and I think it is in large measure just a hypothetical. As footnote 2 in our brief points out, prisons have been generally successful in keeping racist literature out even when it's supported as a claim for religious-based racist literature. The only cases that I've come across where that hasn't prevailed is when the -- the prison's own policy had exceptions in it that made very little sense. And in this case, for example, if you look at joint appendix page 118, there's an allegation that with -- with one piece of literature that was described as racist, that some prisoners were allowed to have it while others were not allowed to have that same kind of literature. Now, I don't know whether those claims are in fact true, but that's the kind of claim that should be able to go forward in a case like this. With all respect, I think the Sixth Circuit here made a mistake, ignored this Court's precedents, and should be reversed.
