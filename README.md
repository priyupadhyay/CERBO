# CERBO
For Semicolons 2018
#

The idea is to develop an application which, given an audio file of a speech/discussion the app will process it and outputs a summary (keypoints) of the whole discussion in a text/audio format.

## Where can Cerbo be used?
- Used during client meetings, conferences, seminars- so that not to miss any key points.
- In schools and colleges- for creating notes and can focus on understanding.
- As a personal assistant-  creating a shopping list.
- In heath care for patients- record doctors conversation and note the important points.
